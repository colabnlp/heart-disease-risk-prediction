6	0	a	PCP:  Dr. Geno Guidry
7	0	a	Code Status: Full Code
8	0	a	ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.
9	0	a	Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.
10	0	a	Past medical records.
11	0	a	History of Present Illness  
12	2	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
13	0	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
14	0	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
15	0	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
16	0	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
17	0	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
18	0	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
19	0	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
20	0	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
21	0	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
22	0	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
23	0	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
24	0	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
25	0	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.
26	0	a	He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.
27	0	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
28	0	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
29	0	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
30	0	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
31	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
32	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
33	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
34	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
35	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
36	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
37	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
38	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
39	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
40	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
41	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
42	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
43	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
44	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).
45	0	a	His last Taxotere treatment was February 17; further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.

231	0	a	I/P: 
232	0	a	73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
233	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
234	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
235	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
236	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
237	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
238	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
239	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
240	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
241	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.
242	0	a	a.
243	0	a	Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.

250	0	a	"g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea."
251	0	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
252	0	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
253	2	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
254	0	a	hypoglycemia).
255	2	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
256	0	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
257	0	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
258	0	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
259	0	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
260	0	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
261	0	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
262	0	a	b.
263	0	a	Check orthostatics daily.
264	0	a	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.

533	0	a	He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency.

547	0	a	Dear Iva:
548	1	a	Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.
549	1	a	At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.
550	1	a	On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.
551	1	a	On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.
552	0	a	"She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications."
553	0	a	She has no shortness of breath.
554	0	a	She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.
555	0	a	She does get epigastric discomfort.
556	2	a	Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.
557	0	a	The review of systems is negative other than the above.
558	0	a	On physical examination, she appears well.
559	0	a	Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.
560	0	a	HEENT:  Normal.
561	0	a	The neck veins are not distended.
562	0	a	The chest is clear.
563	0	a	On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.
564	0	a	Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.
565	0	a	The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
566	0	a	The skin has no rash.
567	0	a	Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.
568	0	a	I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.
569	0	a	Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.
570	0	a	"I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck."""
571	0	a	I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.
572	0	a	I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.
573	0	a	I will plan to see her again in about four months.

834	0	a	Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
835	0	a	Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D.
836	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.
837	0	a	HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.
838	0	a	"The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand."
839	0	a	This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
840	0	a	Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
841	0	a	He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.
842	0	a	Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
843	0	a	He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
844	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.
845	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.
846	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
847	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.
848	0	a	Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
849	0	a	There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
850	0	a	very weak opponens.
851	0	a	He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.
852	0	a	His interossei and extensors are full.
853	0	a	Sensation is intact throughout.
854	0	a	EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.
855	0	a	IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
856	0	a	At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
857	0	a	Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
858	0	a	possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
859	0	a	We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
860	0	a	We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
861	0	a	We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

873	0	a	PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
874	0	a	Reason for visit:
875	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
876	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
877	0	a	Interval History:
878	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
879	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
880	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
881	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
882	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
883	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
884	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
885	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
886	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
887	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
888	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
889	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
890	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
891	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
892	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
893	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
894	0	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
895	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
896	0	a	Lasix 20mg
897	0	a	Toprol XL 50mg
898	0	a	ASA 325mg
899	0	a	Zestril 20mg
900	0	a	Lantus 10 units hs
901	0	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
902	0	a	Multivitamin
903	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
904	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
905	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

924	0	a	Review of systems:
925	0	a	   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.

943	0	a	EKG:
944	0	a	   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.
945	0	a	Impression:
946	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
947	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
948	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
949	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
950	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
951	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
952	0	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
953	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.

1154	0	a	Dear Dr. Mcmahon:
1155	0	a	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.
1156	2	a	He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.
1157	4	a	Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.
1158	1	a	The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.
1159	0	a	The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.
1160	0	a	There were no complications.
1161	0	a	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.
1162	0	a	His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.
1163	0	a	Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.
1164	0	a	Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.
1165	0	a	He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
1166	0	a	He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.
1167	0	a	His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.
1168	0	a	He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.
1169	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.
1170	0	a	Please call if you have questions.

1188	0	a	She has moderate mitral insufficiency.
1189	0	a	Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42.
1190	0	a	She is diabetic and has hypertension.
1191	0	a	She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.
1192	0	a	Her medications were modified somewhat.
1193	0	a	She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID.
1194	0	a	Her blood pressure remains high today at 147/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year.
1195	0	a	Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change.
1196	0	a	She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.
1197	0	a	Her exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
1198	0	a	Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries.
1199	0	a	Clear lungs.

1520	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective.
1521	0	a	She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years.
1522	0	a	She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago.

1594	1	a	   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
1595	0	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
1596	0	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
1597	0	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
1598	0	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
1599	0	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
1600	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

2276	0	a	RE:  Danny Nielson
2277	0	a	MAH#:  
2278	0	a	Dear Dr. Lopez:
2279	0	a	Thanks very much for referring Mr. Nielson to see me for evaluation of his lymphadenopathy.
2280	0	a	I will review his history for you.
2281	0	a	Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.
2282	0	a	About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.
2283	0	a	At that point, a CT scan was performed.
2284	0	a	CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.
2285	0	a	CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.
2286	0	a	The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.
2287	0	a	The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.
2288	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
2289	0	a	Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.
2290	0	a	The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.
2291	0	a	This recurred in 2093.
2292	0	a	He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.

2379	0	a	To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.
2380	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
2381	0	a	1.
2382	0	a	Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
2383	0	a	This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
2384	0	a	I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
2385	0	a	I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
2386	0	a	This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
2387	0	a	These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
2388	0	a	I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.
2389	0	a	The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.
2390	0	a	However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.
2391	0	a	I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
2392	0	a	However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.
2393	0	a	I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
2394	0	a	2.
2395	0	a	Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
2396	0	a	If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.
2397	0	a	He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
2398	0	a	The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
2399	0	a	In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.
2400	0	a	At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.
2401	0	a	At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.
2402	0	a	The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
2403	0	a	Sincerely,
2404	0	a	Gene Quadri, M.D.

2434	1	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
2435	0	a	History of Present Illness
2436	2	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
2437	2	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
2438	0	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
2439	4	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
2440	1	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
2441	4	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
2442	0	a	There was no PCI option available.
2443	0	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
2444	0	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
2445	0	a	He now presented for cath.
2446	4	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
2447	0	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
2448	0	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
2449	0	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
2450	4	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
2451	0	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
2452	0	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
2453	0	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
2454	0	a	He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

2642	2	a	   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.
2643	0	a	His chest pain syndromes have resolved.
2644	0	a	He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.
2645	0	a	This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

2773	0	a	     MRN: 948-59-58-0
2774	0	a	Dear Miles:
2775	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.
2776	0	a	This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
2777	2	a	history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
2778	0	a	prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
2779	0	a	post total knee replacement.
2780	0	a	He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
2781	2	a	coronary artery disease.
2782	2	a	His history of coronary artery disease
2783	0	a	begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
2784	0	a	in June of 2091.
2785	0	a	In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
2786	0	a	and sat down.
2787	0	a	He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
2788	0	a	consciousness or edema.
2789	0	a	Workup at that time included a thallium
2790	0	a	test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
2791	0	a	echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.
2792	0	a	He began therapy
2793	0	a	at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
2794	0	a	Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.
2795	0	a	He had
2796	0	a	been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
2797	0	a	nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
2798	0	a	until this past spring.
2799	0	a	He actually had done very well with risk
2800	0	a	factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
2801	0	a	following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
2802	0	a	weight.
2803	0	a	In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
2804	0	a	up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
2805	0	a	discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.
2806	0	a	He stopped
2807	0	a	working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
2808	0	a	nitrate therapy.
2809	0	a	Since that time he has noted that he has had
2810	0	a	significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
2811	0	a	actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
2812	0	a	taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.
2813	0	a	He does note
2814	0	a	fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
2815	0	a	night.
2816	0	a	He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
2817	0	a	dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
2818	0	a	Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
2819	0	a	Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.
2820	0	a	He has no known drug
2821	0	a	allergies.
2822	0	a	On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
2823	0	a	noted to be 220/100.
2824	0	a	At the present time it is 180/100 with a
2825	0	a	Vicente, Kadeem F.
2826	0	a	MRN: 948-59-58-0
2827	0	a	Page Two
2828	0	a	heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.
2829	0	a	There is no
2830	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
2831	0	a	His carotids are free of
2832	0	a	bruits.
2833	0	a	His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
2834	0	a	and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
2835	0	a	physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.
2836	0	a	Abdominal
2837	0	a	exam is notable for a ventral hernia.
2838	0	a	There is no organomegaly and
2839	0	a	neither are there bruits present.
2840	0	a	Lower extremities are notable
2841	0	a	for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
2842	0	a	pulses with no edema.
2843	0	a	Skin exam is notable only for the senile
2844	0	a	angioma.
2845	0	a	Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
2846	0	a	is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.
2847	0	a	MIBI was
2848	0	a	notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
2849	0	a	significant ischemia on 5/6/94.
2850	0	a	The ejection fraction on a gated
2851	0	a	spect was 57%.
2852	0	a	In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
2853	0	a	myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
2854	0	a	March of 2094.
2855	0	a	He could, however, also have developed his
2856	0	a	progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
2857	0	a	his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.
2858	0	a	I will
2859	0	a	be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.
2860	0	a	In
2861	0	a	either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
2862	0	a	regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
2863	0	a	pressure.
2864	0	a	I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
2865	0	a	and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
2866	0	a	increase to 60 mg p.o.
2867	0	a	q.d.
2868	0	a	I also would consider further decrease
2869	0	a	of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
2870	0	a	assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program.
2871	0	a	Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
2872	0	a	activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route.
2873	0	a	I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
2874	0	a	hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
2875	0	a	risk factor reduction.
2876	0	a	I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you.
2877	0	a	It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
2878	0	a	Sincerely,

3333	0	a	ANC Unit #:  111-64-17
3334	0	a	Dear Dr. Townsend:
3335	0	a	"	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot."
3336	0	a	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.
3337	0	a	She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.
3338	0	a	She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot.
3339	0	a	She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.
3340	0	a	Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her.
3341	0	a	She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in.
3342	0	a	Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.
3343	2	a	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
3344	2	a	Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.
3345	0	a	She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.
3346	0	a	Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.
3347	0	a	She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.
3348	0	a	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.
3349	0	a	She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.
3350	0	a	She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely.
3351	0	a	She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
3352	0	a	The skin is of normal turgor.
3353	0	a	She has no active plantar ulcers on

3357	0	a	either foot.
3358	0	a	At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.
3359	0	a	No new x-rays were obtained today.
3360	0	a	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.
3361	0	a	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.
3362	0	a	It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.
3363	0	a	I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.
3364	0	a	I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.
3365	0	a	We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer.
3366	0	a	She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime.
3367	0	a	Thank you kindly for this referral.

3478	0	a	Dear Dr. Overman: 
3479	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today.
3480	0	a	The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation.
3481	0	a	He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma.
3482	0	a	The symptoms became progressively worse.
3483	0	a	The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture.
3484	0	a	Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily.
3485	0	a	He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale.

4049	2	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
4050	0	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
4051	0	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
4052	0	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
4053	0	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
4054	2	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
4055	0	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
4056	0	a	Will discuss with Drs.
4057	0	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
4058	0	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
4059	0	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
4060	0	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
4061	0	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
4062	0	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
4063	0	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
4064	0	a	Follow sugars while in house
4065	0	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

4342	0	a	Dear Fitzgerald:
4343	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
4344	2	a	As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
4345	4	a	At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.
4346	0	a	The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
4347	2	a	The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.
4348	0	a	There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
4349	2	a	He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
4350	0	a	At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
4351	0	a	That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.
4352	0	a	The right side was patent.
4353	0	a	With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.
4354	0	a	The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
4355	0	a	The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.
4356	0	a	Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
4357	0	a	There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
4358	0	a	The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
4359	0	a	He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.
4360	0	a	The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
4361	0	a	He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
4362	0	a	Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.
4363	0	a	This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
4364	0	a	The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
4365	0	a	He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.
4366	0	a	Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
4367	0	a	He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
4368	0	a	He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.
4369	0	a	The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
4370	0	a	His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
4371	0	a	He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
4372	0	a	He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.
4373	0	a	Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
4374	0	a	He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
4375	0	a	He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.
4376	0	a	Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
4377	0	a	"Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
4378	0	a	At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.
4379	0	a	Past medical history:
4380	0	a	   As above.
4381	0	a	Others include the following:

4451	0	a	Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.
4452	0	a	Other Data:
4453	0	a	   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
4454	0	a	Assessment and plan:
4455	0	a	   1.
4456	0	a	Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.
4457	0	a	This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
4458	0	a	I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.
4459	0	a	Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
4460	0	a	We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
4461	0	a	I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.
4462	0	a	Impression:
4463	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.
4464	0	a	We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.
4465	0	a	Right leg has not been examined in the past.
4466	0	a	Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.
4467	0	a	Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
4468	0	a	Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
4469	0	a	Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
4470	0	a	If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.
4471	0	a	He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.
4472	2	a	Coronary artery disease - stable.
4473	0	a	Diabetes.
4474	0	a	Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

4936	0	a	During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious.
4937	0	a	He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication.
4938	0	a	Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
4939	0	a	Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.
4940	0	a	Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.

5066	0	a	ASSESSMENT
5067	0	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
5068	0	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
5069	0	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
5070	0	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
5071	0	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
5072	0	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
5073	0	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
5074	0	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
5075	0	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
5076	0	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
5077	0	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
5078	0	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
5079	0	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
5080	0	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
5081	0	a	PLAN
5082	0	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
5083	0	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
5084	0	a	-D/c naproxen use.
5085	0	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
5086	0	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
5087	0	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
5088	0	a	#) DM
5089	0	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

5287	2	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
5288	0	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
5289	0	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
5290	0	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
5291	0	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
5292	0	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
5293	2	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
5294	0	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
5295	0	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
5296	0	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
5297	0	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
5298	0	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
5299	0	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
5300	0	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
5301	0	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
5302	0	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
5303	0	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.

5498	0	a	He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA.
5499	0	a	In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason.
5500	0	a	Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.
5501	1	a	His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98).
5502	0	a	He denies taking any NSAIDS.
5503	0	a	He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.
5504	0	a	Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides.
5505	0	a	Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty.
5506	0	a	He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.
5507	0	a	He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg.
5508	0	a	He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock.
5509	0	a	He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level.
5510	0	a	He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows.
5511	0	a	He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.

5576	0	a	ASSESSMENT:
5577	0	a	Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.
5578	0	a	PLAN:
5579	0	a	1.
5580	0	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
5581	0	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
5582	0	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
5583	0	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
5584	0	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
5585	0	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
5586	0	a	2.
5587	0	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
5588	0	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
5589	0	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
5590	0	a	3.
5591	0	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
5592	0	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
5593	0	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
5594	0	a	4.
5595	0	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
5596	0	a	5.
5597	0	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
5598	0	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

5603	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
5604	0	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
5605	0	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
5606	0	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
5607	0	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
5608	0	a	His options are:
5609	0	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
5610	0	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
5611	0	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
5612	0	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

5625	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
5626	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.
5627	0	a	Currently, she complains of
5628	0	a	exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral
5629	0	a	edema.
5630	0	a	Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite
5631	0	a	difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing
5632	0	a	members of our obesity clinic.
5633	0	a	As you know, in the past, she
5634	0	a	also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or
5635	0	a	other invasive studies.
5636	0	a	Presently, she remains on a regimen of
5637	0	a	enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
5638	0	a	q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
5639	0	a	q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
5640	0	a	b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.
5641	0	a	q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o.
5642	0	a	q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o.
5643	0	a	q.d., potassium,
5644	0	a	10 mEq p.o.
5645	0	a	q.d.
5646	0	a	Pumex 2 mg p.o.
5647	0	a	q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,
5648	0	a	Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units
5649	0	a	subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.
5650	0	a	Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no
5651	0	a	acute distress.
5652	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,
5653	0	a	heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and
5654	0	a	unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10
5655	0	a	months ago.
5656	0	a	The neck is soft.
5657	0	a	JVP is flat.
5658	0	a	Carotids without
5659	0	a	significant bruits.
5660	0	a	Chest is clear.
5661	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a
5662	0	a	normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic
5663	0	a	murmur radiating from apex to the base.
5664	0	a	No significant diastolic
5665	0	a	murmur or rub.
5666	0	a	The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.
5667	0	a	Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are
5668	0	a	intact albeit mildly diminished.
5669	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS
5670	0	a	response.
5671	0	a	The P waves are more organized than one might usually
5672	0	a	see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well.
5673	0	a	QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior
5674	1	a	inferior myocardial infarction.
5675	0	a	Compared with his last
5676	0	a	electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.
5677	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,
5678	0	a	and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding
5679	0	a	the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh
5680	0	a	reduction program.
5681	0	a	I once again have strongly encouraged her to
5682	0	a	make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in
5683	0	a	extensive weight reduction.
5684	0	a	I also discussed with her my
5685	0	a	concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral
5686	0	a	edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial
5687	0	a	or tachyarrhythmias.
5688	0	a	As in the past, she told me that she would
5689	0	a	refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other
5690	0	a	studies.
5691	0	a	She did, however, agree to continue with her current
5692	0	a	medical regimen.
5693	0	a	I obtained routine blood studies today to
5694	0	a	verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.
5695	0	a	I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who
5696	0	a	will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he
5697	0	a	next few weeks.
5698	0	a	We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn
5699	0	a	to begin at 2.5 mg p.o.
5700	0	a	q.d., which will help result in some
5701	0	a	degree of mild diuresis.
5702	0	a	Nonetheless, she understands that
5703	0	a	significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction
5704	0	a	program.
5705	0	a	I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac
5706	0	a	morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.
5707	0	a	Beyond this, I
5708	0	a	have not altered her current medical regimen.
5709	0	a	Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.
5710	0	a	Sincerely yours,

6378	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
6379	2	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.
6380	0	a	Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.
6381	0	a	She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.
6382	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.
6383	0	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o.
6384	0	a	q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o.
6385	0	a	q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o.
6386	0	a	q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o.
6387	0	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o.
6388	0	a	q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o.
6389	0	a	q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.
6390	0	a	Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.
6391	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the exam table.
6392	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.
6393	0	a	There are very rare crackles at the bases.
6394	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.
6395	0	a	P2 is increased.
6396	0	a	There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.
6397	0	a	She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.
6398	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.
6399	0	a	There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.
6400	0	a	In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.
6401	0	a	She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.
6402	0	a	In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o.
6403	0	a	q.d.
6404	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.
6405	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.
6406	0	a	It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.
6407	0	a	Sincerely yours,

7202	0	a	Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
7203	0	a	Background:
7204	0	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
7205	0	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
7206	0	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
7207	0	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
7208	0	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
7209	0	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
7210	1	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
7211	0	a	Slowly these lesions healed.
7212	0	a	Interim Issues:
7213	0	a	The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
7214	4	a	But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
7215	1	a	In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
7216	0	a	Recovering from surgery has been slow.
7217	0	a	But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
7218	0	a	She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home.
7219	0	a	She has had no recurrent chest pain.
7220	0	a	She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
7221	0	a	She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se.
7222	0	a	She healed well postoperatively.
7223	0	a	She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
7224	0	a	Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
7225	0	a	In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's.
7226	0	a	She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
7227	0	a	What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
7228	0	a	She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
7229	0	a	She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
7230	0	a	She has had no worsening swallowing.
7231	0	a	She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
7232	0	a	She sleeps on two pillows.
7233	0	a	She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
7234	0	a	She continues on omeprazole.
7235	0	a	Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.
7236	0	a	MEDS:
7237	0	a	Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
7238	0	a	Aspirin  325 MG QD  
7239	0	a	Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD

7258	0	a	PAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0
7259	0	a	She has telangiectasias over her face.
7260	0	a	She looks well to me.
7261	0	a	Her color is good and she smiles easily.
7262	0	a	She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes.
7263	0	a	Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here.
7264	0	a	Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well.
7265	0	a	But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma.
7266	0	a	The midline scar has healed beautifully.
7267	0	a	The respiratory excursions appear full.
7268	0	a	There is no splinting.
7269	0	a	There are some bilateral crackles.
7270	0	a	Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease.
7271	0	a	There are no nail bed infarcts.
7272	0	a	There is some peripheral pitting of digits.

7286	0	a	arthritis.
7287	0	a	I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks.
7288	0	a	Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained.
7289	0	a	I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim.
7290	0	a	Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient.
7291	0	a	She and her husband agree with this plan.

7323	0	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
7324	2	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
7325	0	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
7326	0	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
7327	2	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
7328	0	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
7329	0	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
7330	0	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
7331	0	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
7332	0	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
7333	0	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
7334	0	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
7335	0	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
7336	0	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
7337	0	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
7338	0	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
7339	0	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
7340	0	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
7341	0	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
7342	0	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
7343	0	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
7344	0	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
7345	0	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
7346	0	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
7347	0	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
7348	0	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
7349	0	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
7350	0	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
7351	0	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
7352	0	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
7353	0	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
7354	0	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
7355	0	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
7356	0	a	Chest is clear.
7357	0	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
7358	0	a	PMI is normal.
7359	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
7360	0	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
7361	0	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
7362	0	a	The abdomen is obese.
7363	0	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
7364	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
7365	0	a	Distal pulses are normal.
7366	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
7367	0	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
7368	0	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
7369	2	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
7370	0	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
7371	0	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
7372	0	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
7373	0	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
7374	0	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
7375	0	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
7376	0	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
7377	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
7378	0	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
7379	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
7380	0	a	Kindest personal regards.

7713	0	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
7714	0	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
7715	0	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
7716	0	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
7717	0	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
7718	0	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
7719	0	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
7720	0	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
7721	0	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
7722	0	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
7723	0	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
7724	0	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
7725	2	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
7726	0	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
7727	0	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
7728	0	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
7729	0	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
7730	0	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
7731	0	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
7732	0	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
7733	0	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
7734	0	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
7735	0	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
7736	0	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
7737	0	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
7738	0	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
7739	0	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
7740	0	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
7741	0	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
7742	0	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
7743	0	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
7744	0	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
7745	0	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
7746	0	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
7747	0	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
7748	0	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
7749	0	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
7750	0	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
7751	0	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
7752	0	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
7753	0	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
7754	0	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
7755	0	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
7756	0	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
7757	0	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
7758	0	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
7759	0	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
7760	0	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
7761	0	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
7762	0	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
7763	0	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
7764	0	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
7765	0	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
7766	0	a	Sincerely,
7767	0	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

7784	0	a	Contue statin.
7785	0	a	Willt ransfuse to HGB around 10 and continue to check troponins
7786	0	a	Decreased myocardial function: he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate .
7787	0	a	Will give fluids and transfuse the patient.
7788	0	a	Will get echo in am.
7789	0	a	If his central venous sat  and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia
7790	0	a	Acute blood-loss naemia: will transfuse to 
7791	0	a	Metabolic acidosis: the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis.
7792	0	a	We will for now give volume.
7793	0	a	Acute renal failure: He has significantly decreaed uop.
7794	0	a	We are sending  urine lytes and casts.

8242	0	a	Assessment and plan:
8243	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.
8244	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
8245	0	a	Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.
8246	0	a	We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.
8247	0	a	If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.
8248	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

8261	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male
8262	0	a	with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
8263	2	a	history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and
8264	0	a	DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently
8265	0	a	missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal
8266	0	a	girth and shortness of breath.
8267	0	a	He said that his father has been
8268	0	a	sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time
8269	0	a	helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday
8270	0	a	and missed his Friday dialysis run.
8271	0	a	Today is Sunday and he
8272	0	a	generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.
8273	0	a	When I asked if he
8274	0	a	has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,
8275	0	a	but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and
8276	0	a	was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the
8277	0	a	pain.
8278	0	a	Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain
8279	0	a	when he was exerting himself.
8280	0	a	He does feel slightly increased
8281	0	a	shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks
8282	0	a	that because of increased fluids.
8283	0	a	He has had no fevers or
8284	0	a	chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.
8285	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
8286	2	a	coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,
8287	0	a	diabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,
8288	0	a	substance abuse and GERD.
8289	0	a	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.
8290	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine
8291	0	a	use.
8292	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.
8293	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.

8295	0	a	ALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.
8296	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,
8297	0	a	respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%

8301	0	a	ENT:  Atraumatic.
8302	0	a	Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.
8303	0	a	Chest:  Clear to

8316	0	a	No motor or sensory
8317	0	a	deficits.
8318	0	a	Gait is normal.
8319	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which
8320	0	a	showed normal sinus rhythm.
8321	0	a	No significant ST or T
8322	0	a	abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with
8323	0	a	his previous EKG.
8324	0	a	PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of
8325	0	a	acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.
8326	0	a	Only labs which resulted
8327	0	a	initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets
8328	0	a	423,000 and white count of 6.74.
8329	0	a	We made contact with the renal
8330	0	a	fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the
8331	0	a	dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this
8332	0	a	patient.
8333	0	a	His potassium was not back at the time that he left the
8334	0	a	department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias
8335	0	a	on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is
8336	0	a	very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess
8337	0	a	when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure
8338	0	a	that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.
8339	0	a	After he
8340	0	a	left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1
8341	0	a	and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a
8342	0	a	chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,
8343	0	a	glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium
8344	0	a	8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called
8345	0	a	the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have
8346	0	a	the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to
8347	0	a	treat him there acutely.
8348	0	a	Again after the dialysis, the patient
8349	0	a	will return to the Emergency Department.
8350	0	a	We will reassess if
8351	0	a	symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes.
8352	0	a	If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no
8353	0	a	chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for
8354	0	a	acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not
8355	0	a	acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he
8356	0	a	will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis
8357	0	a	schedule.
8358	0	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.
8359	0	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
8360	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Pending.
8361	0	a	Please see ED note for further ED course.
8362	0	a	This was a shared

8406	0	a	Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
8407	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story
8408	3	a	which sounds convincing for exertional angina.
8409	0	a	She has not had any symptoms in over
8410	0	a	two weeks.

8672	0	a	RE:  Christine Olivier
8673	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
8674	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
8675	0	a	Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
8676	0	a	regarding her current cardiac condition.
8677	0	a	As her history is well
8678	0	a	known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.
8679	0	a	Mrs.
8680	0	a	Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
8681	2	a	coronary artery disease.
8682	0	a	After several catheterizations in the
8683	2	a	2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
8684	3	a	(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
8685	2	a	showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
8686	0	a	was managed medically.
8687	0	a	However, she suffered a non-Q wave
8688	0	a	myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
8689	0	a	underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
8690	0	a	artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
8691	0	a	bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
8692	0	a	her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
8693	0	a	marginal branch.
8694	0	a	She underwent repeat catheterization in February
8695	0	a	of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
8696	0	a	but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
8697	0	a	She
8698	0	a	underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
8699	3	a	a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
8700	0	a	proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
8701	0	a	with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
8702	4	a	and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
8703	0	a	The saphenous
8704	0	a	vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
8705	0	a	stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
8706	0	a	to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
8707	0	a	saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
8708	0	a	The left
8709	0	a	intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
8710	0	a	stenoses.
8711	0	a	Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
8712	0	a	posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%.
8713	0	a	She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
8714	0	a	in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
8715	0	a	to her diagonal artery.
8716	0	a	She tolerated this uneventfully and was 
8717	0	a	Olivier, Christine

8719	0	a	discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
8720	0	a	discomfort.
8721	0	a	Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
8722	0	a	exertional dyspnea.
8723	0	a	She has undergone extensive pulmonary
8724	0	a	evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
8725	0	a	have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
8726	0	a	1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
8727	0	a	with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.
8728	0	a	In
8729	0	a	addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
8730	0	a	hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.
8731	0	a	Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
8732	0	a	insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric

8740	0	a	prn.
8741	0	a	Cigarettes - none at present.
8742	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
8743	0	a	no acute distress.
8744	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
8745	0	a	rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
8746	0	a	pounds.
8747	0	a	The neck is supple.
8748	0	a	JVP flat.
8749	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without
8750	0	a	significant bruits.
8751	0	a	Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
8752	0	a	rhonchi.
8753	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
8754	0	a	and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
8755	0	a	the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
8756	0	a	The abdomen is
8757	0	a	benign with bowel sounds well heard.
8758	0	a	Extremities without
8759	0	a	appreciable edema.
8760	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
8761	0	a	There is 1+
8762	0	a	bipedal edema.
8763	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.
8764	0	a	PR interval
8765	0	a	of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.
8766	0	a	There is evidence of a
8767	0	a	left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
8768	0	a	through V3.
8769	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
8770	0	a	atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
8771	0	a	exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
8772	0	a	She denies any active chest
8773	0	a	discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
8774	3	a	alleviating the chest pain syndrome.
8775	0	a	The records available to me
8776	0	a	indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
8777	0	a	blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
8778	3	a	exacerbation of her angina.
8779	0	a	However, now that she is status post
8780	0	a	her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
8781	0	a	reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
8782	0	a	50 mg po q.d.
8783	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked within the
8784	0	a	next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will
8785	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5                    -3-            July 05, 2074
8786	0	a	also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
8787	0	a	edema and in part because she may no longer need this.
8788	0	a	Otherwise,
8789	0	a	I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
8790	0	a	to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
8791	0	a	can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
8792	3	a	close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur.
8793	0	a	I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
8794	0	a	appropriate.

9008	0	a	HPI: 
9009	1	a	79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI.
9010	0	a	It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday.
9011	0	a	She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV.
9012	0	a	She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress.
9013	0	a	ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection.
9014	0	a	Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.
9015	4	a	On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow.
9016	0	a	Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most.
9017	0	a	LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.
9018	0	a	A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.
9019	0	a	On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr.
9020	0	a	Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012.
9021	0	a	Her Temp.
9022	0	a	was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission.
9023	0	a	She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K.
9024	0	a	Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP.
9025	0	a	Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr.
9026	0	a	When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin.
9027	1	a	The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

9219	0	a	RE:  Christine Olivier
9220	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
9221	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
9222	0	a	Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.
9223	0	a	Currently, she
9224	0	a	complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
9225	0	a	discomfort.
9226	0	a	In addition, she states that she has no energy and
9227	0	a	worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.
9228	0	a	She
9229	0	a	reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
9230	0	a	discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.
9231	0	a	She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
9232	0	a	units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
9233	0	a	sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg
9234	0	a	po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,
9235	0	a	amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mg
9236	0	a	po q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2
9237	0	a	mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
9238	0	a	twenty-four hour period.
9239	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress.
9240	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
9241	0	a	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.
9242	0	a	The neck is
9243	0	a	supple.
9244	0	a	JVP flat.
9245	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
9246	0	a	Chest is completely clear.
9247	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
9248	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
9249	0	a	radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
9250	0	a	murmur or rub.
9251	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
9252	0	a	Extremities without
9253	0	a	appreciable edema.
9254	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
9255	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
9256	0	a	PR interval
9257	0	a	of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.
9258	0	a	There are mild diffuse
9259	0	a	nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left
9260	0	a	ventricular hypertrophy.
9261	0	a	Compared to her last electrocardiogram,
9262	0	a	her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less
9263	0	a	prominent.
9264	0	a	Olivier, Christine
9265	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
9266	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
9267	1	a	multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.
9268	0	a	Currently it is not
9269	0	a	clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
9270	0	a	however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
9271	0	a	(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.
9272	0	a	In addition, I
9273	0	a	will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
9274	0	a	hemoglobin.
9275	0	a	It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
9276	0	a	generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause.
9277	0	a	Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
9278	0	a	present regimen.
9279	0	a	She will contact you or myself should her chest
9280	0	a	pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.
9281	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
9282	0	a	Sincerely yours,

9295	0	a	Mr. Vines comes in today.
9296	0	a	He has been feeling pretty well though he is
9297	0	a	distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.
9298	0	a	His sugars were in the 300s before starting
9299	0	a	the insulin.
9300	0	a	Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.
9301	0	a	His
9302	0	a	fasting sugars have been in the 120s.
9303	0	a	His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s.
9304	0	a	He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a
9305	0	a	month.
9306	0	a	Other than that, he really has no new complaints.
9307	0	a	He is still not smoking.
9308	0	a	He is still on the patch.
9309	0	a	His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he
9310	0	a	can stop the Neurontin now.
9311	0	a	He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or
9312	0	a	edema.
9313	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.

9315	0	a	new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints.
9316	0	a	HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.
9317	0	a	Not getting much exercise now.
9318	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right.
9319	0	a	His pulse is 76 and regular.
9320	0	a	Respirations are 16.

9328	0	a	The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.
9329	0	a	He has some neuropathy of
9330	0	a	the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to
9331	0	a	monofilament is intact on both feet.
9332	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
9333	0	a	(1)  Diabetes.
9334	0	a	Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.
9335	0	a	It may still be a little bit
9336	0	a	     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.
9337	0	a	I
9338	0	a	     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the
9339	0	a	     afternoon.
9340	0	a	If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning
9341	0	a	     insulin to 35 units.
9342	0	a	He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his
9343	0	a	     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.

9781	2	a	Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
9782	0	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
9783	0	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
9784	0	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
9785	0	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
9786	0	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
9787	0	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
9788	0	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
9789	0	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
9790	0	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

9841	0	a	HPI: 
9842	0	a	This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain.
9843	0	a	The first episode started this AM (10AM).
9844	0	a	It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic.
9845	0	a	Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v.
9846	0	a	Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.
9847	0	a	He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case.
9848	1	a	He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.
9849	0	a	Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain.
9850	0	a	On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain.
9851	0	a	He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker.
9852	1	a	His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3.
9853	0	a	First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

9971	0	a	   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o.
9972	0	a	male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.
9973	0	a	Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection.
9974	0	a	His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.
9975	0	a	Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss.
9976	0	a	During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.
9977	0	a	His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake.
9978	0	a	Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition.
9979	0	a	He was discharged without incident on 12/30.
9980	0	a	The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months.
9981	0	a	He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.
9982	0	a	Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations.
9983	0	a	He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6.
9984	0	a	At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.
9985	0	a	A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.

10372	0	a	Assessment and plan:
10373	0	a	   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI.
10374	0	a	We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention.
10375	0	a	We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death.
10376	0	a	He understands and has agreed to proceed.
10377	0	a	We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation.
10378	0	a	He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation.
10379	0	a	We have had a long discussion in this regard.
10380	0	a	We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly.
10381	0	a	His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.
10382	0	a	Sotalol is the best option at this time.
10383	0	a	We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079.
10384	0	a	If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load.
10385	0	a	We will assess after his angiogram.
10386	0	a	We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis.
10387	0	a	We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status.

10442	0	a	Dear Dr. Galvan:
10443	2	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.
10444	0	a	He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.
10445	0	a	Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.
10446	0	a	No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.
10447	0	a	No reflux symptoms.
10448	0	a	Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.
10449	0	a	He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.
10450	0	a	Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d.
10451	0	a	(continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.
10452	0	a	On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.
10453	0	a	Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.
10454	0	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
10455	0	a	Sinuses nontender.
10456	0	a	Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.
10457	0	a	Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.
10458	0	a	No goiter or adenopathy.
10459	0	a	Back:  Normal configuration.
10460	0	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.
10461	0	a	Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.
10462	0	a	Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
10463	0	a	Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
10464	0	a	Skin:  Well tanned.
10465	0	a	Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.
10466	0	a	CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.
10467	0	a	Impression:
10468	0	a	Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.
10469	0	a	Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.
10470	2	a	Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.
10471	0	a	Myasthenia, mainly ocular.
10472	0	a	Prior Raynaud's syndrome.
10473	0	a	Recommendations:
10474	0	a	Continue Advair at the current dose.
10475	0	a	Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o.
10476	0	a	q. p.m.
10477	0	a	Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.
10478	0	a	Continue exercise program.
10479	0	a	Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.
10480	0	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.

11029	0	a	PROCEDURE
11030	0	a	PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY was performed on the Mid RCA using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9YS7EZ guiding catheter.
11031	1	a	Assessment:  Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out MI with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.
11032	0	a	Plan:
11033	0	a	1.
11034	0	a	Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.
11035	0	a	However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.
11036	0	a	Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.
11037	0	a	Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.
11038	0	a	Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.
11039	0	a	Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.
11040	0	a	Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.
11041	0	a	2.
11042	0	a	SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.
11043	0	a	3.
11044	0	a	GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.
11045	0	a	Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin.
11046	0	a	although unlikely as elevation is minimal.

11057	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
11058	0	a	She has been doing very well.
11059	0	a	She has been exercising and has lost from 
11060	0	a	200 to 170 pounds.
11061	0	a	She is feeling very well.
11062	0	a	Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.
11063	0	a	He did not find the 
11064	0	a	first ETT acceptable.
11065	4	a	The second ETT was grossly positive.
11066	0	a	As a result 
11067	0	a	of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
11068	0	a	atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
11069	0	a	nitrate.
11070	0	a	She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
11071	0	a	pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
11072	0	a	She did have hyperlipidemia.
11073	0	a	We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
11074	0	a	provided some control.
11075	0	a	However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
11076	0	a	is not an excellent ratio.
11077	0	a	Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
11078	0	a	limits.
11079	0	a	She also has right shoulder lipoma.
11080	0	a	This has become apparent since she 
11081	0	a	lost so much weight.
11082	0	a	She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
11083	0	a	recommended Dr. Dawson.
11084	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
11085	0	a	120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.
11086	0	a	Neck is supple.
11087	0	a	There 
11088	0	a	is no lymphadenopathy.
11089	0	a	Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
11090	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
11091	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
11092	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
11093	0	a	Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.
11094	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  None today.
11095	0	a	Page 2
11096	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
11097	0	a	1.
11098	2	a	CAD.
11099	0	a	We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.
11100	0	a	I also 
11101	0	a	gave her nitroglycerine.
11102	0	a	We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
11103	0	a	continue her atenolol.
11104	0	a	She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
11105	0	a	Premarin and Synthroid.
11106	0	a	2.
11107	0	a	Weight loss.
11108	0	a	She will continue to exercise.
11109	0	a	I suspect she is going 
11110	0	a	to lose more weight.
11111	0	a	This is excellent.
11112	0	a	3.
11113	2	a	Coronary artery disease.
11114	0	a	Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
11115	0	a	cardiac catheterization.
11116	0	a	It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
11117	0	a	this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
11118	0	a	She is going to 
11119	0	a	delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
11120	0	a	done on this variety of medical issues.

11349	0	a	ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
11350	0	a	Impression:  
11351	0	a	Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
11352	0	a	His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
11353	0	a	His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
11354	0	a	He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
11355	0	a	Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
11356	0	a	Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.
11357	0	a	Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
11358	0	a	He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
11359	0	a	His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
11360	0	a	He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
11361	3	a	Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
11362	0	a	His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

11510	0	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
11511	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4
11512	0	a	Dear Dr.
11513	0	a	Craft:
11514	0	a	I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.
11515	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
11516	0	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
11517	0	a	The patient does relate that
11518	0	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
11519	0	a	worse several years ago.
11520	0	a	However, with the treatment of his
11521	2	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
11522	0	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
11523	0	a	Since that
11524	0	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
11525	0	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
11526	0	a	At the same
11527	0	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
11528	0	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
11529	0	a	Lasix.
11530	0	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
11531	0	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
11532	0	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
11533	0	a	At the current time,
11534	0	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
11535	0	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
11536	0	a	months ago.
11537	0	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
11538	0	a	supplemental oxygen.
11539	0	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
11540	0	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
11541	0	a	coughing.
11542	0	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
11543	2	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
11544	0	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
11545	0	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
11546	0	a	upper GI bleed.
11547	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70
11548	2	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
11549	0	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
11550	0	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
11551	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
11552	0	a	He discontinued cigarette
11553	0	a	smoking years ago.
11554	0	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
11555	0	a	His pulse was
11556	0	a	56, afebrile.
11557	0	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
11558	0	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
11559	0	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
11560	0	a	He is in no
11561	0	a	respiratory distress at rest.
11562	0	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
11563	0	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
11564	0	a	His neck had no
11565	0	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
11566	0	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
11567	0	a	left base with crackles.
11568	0	a	His right lung was clear.
11569	0	a	His heart
11570	0	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
11571	0	a	murmur.
11572	0	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
11573	0	a	His
11574	0	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
11575	0	a	Pulmonary
11576	0	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
11577	0	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
11578	0	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
11579	0	a	His current
11580	0	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
11581	0	a	December.
11582	0	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
11583	0	a	I took Mr. Joshi
11584	0	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
11585	0	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
11586	0	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
11587	0	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
11588	0	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
11589	0	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
11590	0	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
11591	0	a	Mr. Joshi had several
11592	0	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
11593	0	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
11594	0	a	I do
11595	0	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
11596	0	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
11597	0	a	I do recommend that he get
11598	0	a	daily exercise.
11599	0	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
11600	0	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
11601	0	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
11602	0	a	I have also
11603	0	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
11604	0	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
11605	0	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
11606	0	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
11607	0	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary 
11608	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70
11609	0	a	vascular disease.
11610	0	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
11611	0	a	his initial work-up.
11612	0	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
11613	0	a	patient.
11614	0	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

11631	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
11632	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
11633	1	a	As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.
11634	1	a	At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.
11635	2	a	No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.
11636	0	a	Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
11637	4	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
11638	0	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
11639	3	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.
11640	2	a	He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.
11641	0	a	At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.
11642	0	a	Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.
11643	0	a	He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.
11644	0	a	He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
11645	0	a	He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.
11646	0	a	He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.
11647	0	a	"He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well."
11648	0	a	He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.
11649	0	a	He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.
11650	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
11651	0	a	His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.
11652	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.
11653	0	a	His past medical history includes:
11654	1	a	  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA

11659	0	a	  hypothyroid

11670	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
11671	0	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
11672	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.
11673	0	a	He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.
11674	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
11675	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
11676	0	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
11677	0	a	He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.
11678	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.
11679	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
11680	0	a	His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.
11681	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
11682	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
11683	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
11684	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
11685	0	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
11686	1	a	In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.
11687	0	a	He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.
11688	0	a	Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.
11689	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
11690	0	a	His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.
11691	0	a	I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.
11692	0	a	As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.
11693	0	a	We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.
11694	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
11695	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
11696	0	a	Regards,

11915	0	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which

11917	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
11918	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
11919	0	a	She had 1mm

11922	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
11923	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
11924	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
11925	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
11926	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
11927	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
11928	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
11929	0	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
11930	0	a	She 
11931	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
11932	0	a	for taking it.
11933	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is

11935	0	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
11936	0	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
11937	0	a	I will continue to work 
11938	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
11939	0	a	Her other risk 
11940	0	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
11941	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
11942	0	a	Her 
11943	0	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
11944	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
11945	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
11946	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
11947	0	a	hospital.

12262	0	a	For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history 
12263	0	a	briefly.
12264	0	a	It includes a history of atrial fibrillation.
12265	0	a	She is status 
12266	0	a	post an MVR with Duluth Clinic.
12267	0	a	She is on chronic anti-coagulation.
12268	0	a	She is 
12269	0	a	status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
12270	0	a	strep glomerular nephritis.
12271	0	a	She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
12272	0	a	several decades with no history of rejection.
12273	0	a	She also has a history of 
12274	1	a	a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement.
12275	0	a	As well, she has a 
12276	0	a	history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated 
12277	0	a	intermittently with epidural steroid injection.
12278	0	a	About a year ago, she 
12279	0	a	had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
12280	0	a	some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
12281	0	a	fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
12282	0	a	nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
12283	0	a	fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home.
12284	0	a	I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
12285	0	a	where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully 
12286	0	a	treated with levofloxacin.
12287	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
12288	0	a	include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, 
12289	0	a	Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, 
12290	0	a	Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg 
12291	0	a	three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on 
12292	0	a	her INR.
12293	0	a	ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
12294	0	a	cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
12295	0	a	which seems to have been stopped.
12296	0	a	As well, she is on sliding scale 
12297	0	a	insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently.
12298	0	a	Page 2
12299	0	a	The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were 
12300	0	a	concerned that she was not getting optimal care.
12301	0	a	In talking to her, she 
12302	0	a	says she feels quite well.
12303	0	a	She has no pain.
12304	0	a	She has no pain in her 
12305	0	a	buttocks or her legs.
12306	0	a	She says her breathing feels well.
12307	0	a	She has no 
12308	0	a	productive cough.
12309	0	a	She has no chest pain.
12310	0	a	She denies any peripheral 
12311	0	a	edema.
12312	0	a	She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
12313	0	a	exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she 
12314	0	a	is getting reasonable care.
12315	0	a	However, she does breakdown and cry about 
12316	0	a	her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
12317	0	a	home.
12318	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70.
12319	0	a	She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72.
12320	0	a	She 
12321	0	a	has sharp clicks over her chest.
12322	0	a	She has a soft abdomen with no 
12323	0	a	organomegaly and a well healed scar.
12324	0	a	She has equal pulses bilaterally.
12325	0	a	She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags.
12326	0	a	She has a full 
12327	0	a	range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and 
12328	0	a	ankles.
12329	0	a	She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
12330	0	a	she seems relatively stable.
12331	0	a	She is somewhat confused about the date and 
12332	0	a	the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly 
12333	0	a	about her current situation at Elm Hills.
12334	0	a	I have no laboratory data to speak of.
12335	0	a	I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
12336	0	a	and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
12337	0	a	and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
12338	0	a	unsupervised setting.
12339	0	a	I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
12340	0	a	place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
12341	0	a	antidepressant.
12342	0	a	It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
12343	0	a	recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of 
12344	0	a	SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects.
12345	0	a	I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, 
12346	0	a	but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
12347	0	a	me with questions about her past history.

12471	0	a	Dear Dr.

12473	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.
12474	0	a	This lovely gentleman with coronary artery
12475	1	a	disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction
12476	0	a	notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,
12477	0	a	who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.
12478	0	a	Despite this
12479	0	a	intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,
12480	0	a	palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present
12481	0	a	time.
12482	2	a	He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg
12483	0	a	p.o.
12484	0	a	t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,
12485	0	a	simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
12486	0	a	b.i.d., Prevacid,
12487	0	a	multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.
12488	0	a	On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.
12489	0	a	His heart
12490	0	a	rate is 54 and regular.
12491	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
12492	0	a	There is no
12493	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
12494	0	a	Carotids are without
12495	0	a	bruits.
12496	0	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
12497	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and
12498	0	a	physiologically split S2.
12499	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender.
12500	0	a	He
12501	0	a	has no bruits.
12502	0	a	His extremities are warm with strong symmetric
12503	0	a	pulses and motor strength throughout.
12504	0	a	He has no peripheral edema
12505	0	a	at the present time.
12506	0	a	His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus
12507	1	a	bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,
12508	0	a	and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior
12509	0	a	electrocardiograms.
12510	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a
12511	0	a	concerning blood pressure.
12512	0	a	At this point, he notes that he is
12513	2	a	actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue
12514	0	a	to do that.
12515	0	a	We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will
12516	0	a	be following up with you within the next few weeks.
12517	0	a	If there are
12518	0	a	any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me
12519	0	a	a call.

12532	0	a	I confirm that I have

12535	0	a	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
12536	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a
12537	0	a	history of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.
12538	0	a	The patient
12539	0	a	denies any nausea or vomiting.
12540	1	a	He does have history of MI as
12541	2	a	well as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.
12542	0	a	He
12543	0	a	also reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has
12544	0	a	left greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive
12545	0	a	surgery following motor vehicle collision.
12546	0	a	Of note, the
12547	0	a	patient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial
12548	0	a	fibrillation.
12549	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no
12550	0	a	distress.
12551	0	a	His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory
12552	0	a	rate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on
12553	0	a	room air and 98% on 2 liters.
12554	0	a	His lungs are clear and heart is
12555	0	a	irregularly irregular.
12556	0	a	This is somewhat limited due to body
12557	0	a	habitus.
12558	0	a	The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper
12559	0	a	quadrant tenderness.
12560	0	a	The back shows left CVA tenderness.
12561	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of
12562	0	a	42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.
12563	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers are
12564	0	a	negative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.
12565	0	a	A d-dimer is less
12566	0	a	than 200.
12567	0	a	The INR is 1.7.
12568	0	a	UA is pending.
12569	0	a	ECG shows an atrial
12570	0	a	fibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3
12571	0	a	through V6.
12572	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due
12573	0	a	to patient's habitus.
12574	0	a	DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  There was no
12575	0	a	clear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.
12576	0	a	Given his
12577	0	a	anticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is
12578	0	a	unlikely to be PE.
12579	0	a	It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given
12580	2	a	the history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal
12581	0	a	electrocardiogram.
12582	0	a	This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is
12583	0	a	not terribly helpful.
12584	0	a	We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest
12585	0	a	without IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary
12586	0	a	architecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine
12587	0	a	Service for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.

12841	0	a	Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital
12842	0	a	CC:  chest pain
12843	0	a	HPI:
12844	3	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.
12845	3	a	In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.
12846	0	a	He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.
12847	1	a	Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.
12848	0	a	The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.
12849	0	a	On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.
12850	0	a	Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.
12851	0	a	A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
12852	0	a	Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.
12853	0	a	His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
12854	0	a	Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
12855	0	a	He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
12856	0	a	Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.
12857	0	a	These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.
12858	0	a	The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.
12859	0	a	His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
12860	3	a	He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
12861	0	a	Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.
12862	0	a	The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.
12863	0	a	Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.
12864	0	a	The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.
12865	0	a	In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.
12866	0	a	EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
12867	0	a	Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.
12868	0	a	A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.
12869	0	a	CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.
12870	0	a	Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.

12965	0	a	Assessment:
12966	0	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.
12967	1	a	The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.
12968	0	a	The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.
12969	0	a	The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.
12970	0	a	The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.
12971	0	a	In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.
12972	0	a	The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.
12973	0	a	Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.
12974	1	a	This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.
12975	0	a	EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.
12976	0	a	The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.
12977	0	a	The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.
12978	0	a	The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.
12979	0	a	Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.

13020	0	a	Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
13021	0	a	In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms.
13022	0	a	He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time.
13023	0	a	The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
13024	0	a	Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week.
13025	0	a	He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema.
13026	0	a	He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
13027	0	a	He does not know the details of the workup.
13028	0	a	Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65.
13029	0	a	He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
13030	0	a	In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro.
13031	0	a	HR was 85 and BP 135/82.
13032	0	a	He was given ASA and a BB.
13033	0	a	Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6.
13034	0	a	Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6.
13035	0	a	There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
13036	0	a	He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44).
13037	0	a	A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
13038	0	a	(the ddimer was elevated).
13039	0	a	His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
13040	0	a	On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free.
13041	0	a	Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema.
13042	0	a	ASA and BB were cont.
13043	0	a	The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
13044	0	a	However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead.
13045	0	a	This is planned for this morning.
13046	0	a	Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

13135	0	a	Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.
13136	2	a	He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.
13137	0	a	Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.
13138	0	a	His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.
13139	2	a	He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.
13140	0	a	The Pt sleeps on one pillow.
13141	0	a	During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.
13142	0	a	These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.
13143	0	a	Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.

13273	0	a	Echo (6/93):  EF 60%, symmetric LVH
13274	2	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
13275	0	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
13276	0	a	Although, there were no 
13277	0	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
13278	0	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
13279	0	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
13280	0	a	However, Pt 
13281	0	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
13282	0	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
13283	0	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
13284	0	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
13285	0	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
13286	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
13287	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
13288	0	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
13289	0	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
13290	0	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
13291	0	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
13292	0	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
13293	0	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
13294	0	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
13295	0	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
13296	0	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
13297	0	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.
13298	0	a	"3)	DM - Sugars elevated."
13299	0	a	Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.
13300	0	a	"4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable."
13301	0	a	Cont home medication of Lipitor.
13302	0	a	"5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet."
13303	0	a	Consider a diabetic diet as well.
13304	0	a	"6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized."

13307	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
13308	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
13309	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
13310	0	a	Briefly:
13311	2	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
13312	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
13313	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
13314	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
13315	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
13316	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
13317	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
13318	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
13319	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

13630	2	a	HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.
13631	0	a	He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking.
13632	0	a	He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
13633	0	a	He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
13634	1	a	He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
13635	3	a	He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.
13636	0	a	He has not had any rest pain.
13637	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
13638	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
13639	2	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
13640	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
13641	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
13642	0	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
13643	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
13644	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
13645	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
13646	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
13647	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
13648	0	a	Chest was clear.
13649	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
13650	0	a	No S3 or S4.
13651	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
13652	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
13653	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
13654	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
13655	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
13656	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
13657	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
13658	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
13659	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

13672	0	a	     ILC #158-42-11-2
13673	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
13674	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.
13675	0	a	She continues to
13676	3	a	complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
13677	0	a	secondary to exertion.
13678	0	a	These episodes occur on a roughly once a
13679	0	a	month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes.
13680	0	a	Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
13681	0	a	effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
13682	0	a	not take Nitroglycerin for it.
13683	0	a	A stress test performed last
13684	0	a	January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
13685	0	a	of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
13686	0	a	blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.
13687	0	a	She had no ischemic
13688	0	a	EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
13689	0	a	scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
13690	0	a	surrounding area of transient ischemia.
13691	0	a	In addition, there was a
13692	0	a	moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
13693	0	a	infarct mild ischemia.
13694	0	a	Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
13695	0	a	with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192.
13696	0	a	She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.

13717	0	a	remains clear.
13718	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically
13719	0	a	split S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.
13720	0	a	The abdomen is
13721	0	a	benign.
13722	0	a	Extremities without appreciable edema.
13723	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval
13724	0	a	.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.
13725	0	a	There are isolated atrial
13726	0	a	premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block
13727	0	a	and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
13728	0	a	nonspecific ST and T wave changes.
13729	0	a	Compared to his last
13730	0	a	electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
13731	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
13732	3	a	angina.
13733	0	a	I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
13734	0	a	q h.s.
13735	0	a	for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
13736	0	a	more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
13737	0	a	aerobic activity level.
13738	0	a	In addition, I have asked her to obtain
13739	0	a	her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
13740	0	a	ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
13741	0	a	140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
13742	0	a	antihypertensive therapy.
13743	0	a	In addition, as long as she remains
13744	0	a	active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
13745	0	a	stress test in one to one and a half years time.

13765	0	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
13766	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
13767	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
13768	2	a	follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.
13769	0	a	At her last visit her
13770	0	a	heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.
13771	0	a	We increased both her Losartan and
13772	0	a	her Toprol dosing.
13773	0	a	Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.
13774	0	a	She has generally been
13775	0	a	feeling well.
13776	0	a	She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping.
13777	0	a	She denies orthopnea or PND.
13778	0	a	She has had stable ankle edema.
13779	0	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
13780	0	a	PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
13781	0	a	day, Avandia, and multivitamins.
13782	0	a	On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.
13783	0	a	Her heart rate is in the high 60s.
13784	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the examination table.
13785	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8.
13786	0	a	Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.
13787	0	a	Cardiac examination reveals a
13788	0	a	non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.
13789	0	a	She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
13790	0	a	at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
13791	0	a	border.
13792	0	a	She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.
13793	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.
13794	0	a	There are
13795	0	a	nonspecific ST abnormalities.
13796	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.
13797	0	a	She
13798	0	a	has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.
13799	0	a	We elected
13800	0	a	to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
13801	0	a	PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

14075	0	a	There is borderline
14076	0	a	Page Two
14077	0	a	evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
14078	0	a	wave changes.
14079	0	a	Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has
14080	0	a	been no significant change.
14081	0	a	Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left
14082	0	a	shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
14083	3	a	surgery angina.
14084	0	a	In this setting, a dobutamine stress test
14085	0	a	performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.
14086	0	a	I
14087	0	a	have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
14088	0	a	therapeutic and diagnostic options.
14089	0	a	She made it quite clear that
14090	0	a	she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,
14091	0	a	and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility
14092	0	a	(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
14093	0	a	vascularization.
14094	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me that her left
14095	0	a	shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly
14096	0	a	understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities.
14097	0	a	I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.
14098	0	a	In the
14099	0	a	meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort
14100	0	a	syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
14101	0	a	bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
14102	0	a	morning.
14103	0	a	She will call me within the next several days to report
14104	0	a	how this helps her discomfort syndrome.
14105	0	a	I do not believe that she
14106	0	a	is having GERD to explain her symptoms.
14107	0	a	In light of her reluctance
14108	0	a	to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to
14109	0	a	tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
14110	0	a	discomfort syndrome.
14111	0	a	I, of course, will keep you fully informed as
14112	0	a	to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her
14113	0	a	care.
14114	0	a	Sincerely yours,

14293	0	a	ASSESSMENT:
14294	0	a	1.
14295	0	a	Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.
14296	0	a	We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.
14297	0	a	The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.
14298	0	a	He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.
14299	0	a	However, the episodicity is significant.
14300	0	a	2.
14301	0	a	Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.
14302	0	a	His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.
14303	0	a	However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.
14304	0	a	It is also possible that this is related to angina.
14305	0	a	3.
14306	0	a	Other related risks.
14307	0	a	He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.
14308	0	a	It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.
14309	0	a	There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.
14310	0	a	At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.
14311	0	a	Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.
14312	0	a	We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

14553	0	a	Dear Ken:
14554	1	a	Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
14555	1	a	As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.
14556	0	a	He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.
14557	0	a	His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.
14558	0	a	He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.
14559	0	a	He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.
14560	0	a	Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.
14561	0	a	He is slowly recovering his overall strength.
14562	0	a	The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.
14563	0	a	On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
14564	0	a	q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
14565	0	a	q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o.
14566	0	a	q.d., p.r.n.
14567	0	a	Tylenol No.
14568	0	a	3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o.
14569	0	a	q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o.
14570	0	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o.
14571	0	a	q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o.
14572	0	a	b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
14573	0	a	q.d.
14574	0	a	Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.
14575	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.
14576	0	a	The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
14577	0	a	Chest is clear.
14578	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
14579	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
14580	0	a	Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.
14581	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.
14582	0	a	There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.
14583	0	a	An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.
14584	0	a	No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.
14585	1	a	Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.
14586	0	a	I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.
14587	0	a	I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.
14588	0	a	At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.
14589	0	a	In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.
14590	0	a	In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.
14591	2	a	I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.
14592	0	a	He will have routine blood studies obtained today.
14593	0	a	I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.
14594	0	a	Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.
14595	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.
14596	0	a	Sincerely yours,

14612	0	a	Code: Full
14613	0	a	CC:     Want to get my chemo   
14614	0	a	ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.
14615	0	a	HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
14616	0	a	He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.
14617	0	a	He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.
14618	0	a	He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
14619	0	a	Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
14620	0	a	The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.
14621	0	a	PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.
14622	0	a	It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
14623	0	a	The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
14624	0	a	PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
14625	0	a	The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.
14626	0	a	Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.
14627	0	a	Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.
14628	0	a	Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.
14629	0	a	He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
14630	0	a	Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
14631	0	a	He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
14632	0	a	On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.
14633	0	a	He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
14634	0	a	He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
14635	0	a	He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.
14636	0	a	Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

14792	0	a	RE: Benitez, Wonda
14793	0	a	MR: 89276954
14794	0	a	Dear Usha:
14795	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
14796	0	a	Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
14797	1	a	post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.
14798	0	a	As you
14799	0	a	know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
14800	0	a	wall ischemia.
14801	0	a	I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new.
14802	1	a	On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
14803	0	a	have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.
14804	0	a	Therefore,
14805	0	a	I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
14806	0	a	probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
14807	0	a	bypass this area.
14808	0	a	She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
14809	0	a	venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal.
14810	0	a	She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
14811	0	a	recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.
14812	0	a	However,
14813	0	a	she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
14814	0	a	history of otitis media in her right ear.
14815	0	a	Therefore, I think it
14816	0	a	wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
14817	0	a	her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.
14818	0	a	In the
14819	0	a	meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
14820	0	a	nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
14821	0	a	these episodes.
14822	0	a	I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
14823	0	a	these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
14824	0	a	with her cardiovascular system.
14825	0	a	She will return to see me in
14826	0	a	follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
14827	0	a	cholesterol level.
14828	0	a	Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
14829	0	a	patient.
14830	0	a	Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
14831	0	a	questions.
14832	0	a	With warm regards,

14845	0	a	RE:  Urania Yerger
14846	0	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
14847	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
14848	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first
14849	0	a	time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her
14850	1	a	coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in
14851	0	a	October of this year.
14852	0	a	Though you know her history well, I will
14853	0	a	recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
14854	0	a	Ms. Yerger is
14855	0	a	presently 81 years old.
14856	0	a	Her vascular risk factors include
14857	0	a	diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.
14858	0	a	She had no prior diagnosis
14859	0	a	of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash
14860	0	a	pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST
14861	0	a	elevation myocardial infarction.
14862	0	a	Coronary angiography at the
14863	0	a	Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,
14864	0	a	thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent
14865	0	a	complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal
14866	0	a	as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
14867	0	a	Angiography also
14868	0	a	revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.
14869	0	a	The patient underwent
14870	1	a	subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed
14871	1	a	by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
14872	0	a	(SVG to
14873	0	a	ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).
14874	0	a	Ms. Yerger's postoperative
14875	0	a	course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient
14876	0	a	episode of atrial fibrillation.
14877	0	a	Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of
14878	0	a	activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending
14879	0	a	shopping trips.
14880	0	a	Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve.
14881	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.
14882	0	a	She has
14883	0	a	had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein
14884	0	a	graft harvesting.
14885	0	a	She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA
14886	0	a	symptoms or claudication.
14887	0	a	Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
14888	0	a	Ms.
14889	0	a	Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on
14890	0	a	her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a
14891	0	a	possible viral exanthem.
14892	0	a	Yerger, Urania
14893	0	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078
14894	0	a	Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency
14895	0	a	(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and
14896	0	a	prior right knee replacement.
14897	0	a	Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.
14898	0	a	day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril
14899	0	a	5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.
14900	0	a	day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.
14901	0	a	Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family
14902	0	a	members in the area.
14903	0	a	She is currently staying with her daughter.
14904	0	a	At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but
14905	0	a	is limited by chronic knee pain.
14906	0	a	She denies alcohol or tobacco
14907	0	a	use.
14908	0	a	Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.
14909	0	a	On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.
14910	0	a	She is
14911	0	a	comfortable seated on the exam table.
14912	0	a	Her skin is warm and dry.
14913	0	a	She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly
14914	0	a	on her extremities.
14915	0	a	Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate
14916	0	a	is in the 70's.
14917	0	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
14918	0	a	Her
14919	0	a	carotids are 2+ without bruits.
14920	0	a	Her chest reveals decreased breath
14921	0	a	sounds at the left base.
14922	0	a	There are no crackles or wheezes.
14923	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and
14924	0	a	rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased.
14925	0	a	There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the
14926	0	a	apex.
14927	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
14928	0	a	Her extremities are free
14929	0	a	of cyanosis or clubbing.
14930	0	a	Distal pulses are 1+.
14931	0	a	She has mild edema
14932	0	a	of the left lower extremity.
14933	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and
14934	0	a	intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
14935	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after
14936	1	a	her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
14937	0	a	October.
14938	0	a	Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
14939	0	a	persistent pleural effusion.
14940	0	a	We will reevaluate today with a
14941	0	a	repeat chest x-ray.
14942	0	a	In the meantime, I think that we should
14943	0	a	continue her oral diuretic regimen.
14944	0	a	It is possible that her
14945	0	a	persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
14946	0	a	Although not certain to
14947	0	a	be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today
14948	0	a	in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
14949	0	a	resolve.
14950	0	a	I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
14951	0	a	We
14952	0	a	will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for
14953	0	a	secondary prevention.
14954	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in
14955	0	a	approximately eight to twelve weeks.
14956	0	a	In addition, she will follow-
14957	0	a	up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
14958	0	a	persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
14959	0	a	symptoms.

15110	0	a	DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
15111	0	a	CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
15112	0	a	Dear Vicente, 
15113	0	a	Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.
15114	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year.
15115	0	a	He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
15116	0	a	In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.
15117	0	a	He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
15118	0	a	"He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep."
15119	0	a	"He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties."
15120	0	a	He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
15121	0	a	Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas.
15122	0	a	In addition, loud snoring was noted.
15123	0	a	There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes.
15124	0	a	"There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep."
15125	0	a	"There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study."
15126	0	a	In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
15127	0	a	The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm.
15128	0	a	Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes).
15129	0	a	"There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep""."
15130	0	a	"Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows""."
15131	0	a	The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general.
15132	0	a	As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.
15133	0	a	Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology).
15134	0	a	"The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day""."
15135	0	a	If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.
15136	2	a	The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.
15137	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  
15138	0	a	1.

15158	0	a	Coated aspirin.
15159	0	a	ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.
15160	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage.
15161	0	a	He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years.
15162	0	a	His current weight is 195 pounds.
15163	0	a	He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.
15164	0	a	On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.
15165	0	a	HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.
15166	0	a	The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact.
15167	0	a	He is presently wearing dental braces.
15168	0	a	No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
15169	0	a	No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted.
15170	0	a	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
15171	0	a	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
15172	0	a	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
15173	0	a	"No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted."
15174	0	a	IMPRESSION:  
15175	0	a	"Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep."
15176	0	a	These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).
15177	0	a	Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea.
15178	0	a	The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm).
15179	0	a	"In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success."
15180	0	a	"One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above."
15181	0	a	Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem.
15182	0	a	While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e.
15183	0	a	in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
15184	0	a	PLAN:  
15185	0	a	In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.
15186	0	a	q. h.s.
15187	0	a	PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
15188	0	a	The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.
15189	0	a	The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.
15190	0	a	Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms).
15191	0	a	If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.
15192	0	a	In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.
15193	0	a	The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).
15194	0	a	Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez.
15195	0	a	I hope this letter finds you well.

15656	0	a	While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.
15657	0	a	CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.

16384	0	a	He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.
16385	0	a	Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.
16386	0	a	The goal is to maintain BS<175.
16387	0	a	He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.
16388	0	a	At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.
16389	0	a	He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.
16390	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

16481	0	a	       MR #631-90-33-7
16482	0	a	Dear Dr. Patton:
16483	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
16484	0	a	his coronary artery
16485	0	a	disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.
16486	0	a	As you know, this is a 
16487	0	a	63-year-old male with a
16488	2	a	long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 
16489	0	a	peripheral vascular
16490	0	a	disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 
16491	0	a	diagnosed
16492	0	a	esophageal carcinoma.
16493	0	a	He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 
16494	0	a	Landers, for the last nine
16495	0	a	years.
16496	0	a	Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
16497	0	a	artery disease which is
16498	0	a	documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
16499	0	a	The 
16500	0	a	catheterization demonstrated
16501	0	a	right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 
16502	0	a	and a 30%
16503	0	a	marginal 1 lesion.
16504	0	a	There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
16505	0	a	PDA and from the
16506	0	a	septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.
16507	0	a	procedure was
16508	0	a	performed through the right radial artery without complications.
16509	0	a	Patient 
16510	0	a	also has peripheral
16511	0	a	vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
16512	0	a	vein bypass graft in
16513	0	a	2088.
16514	0	a	He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
16515	0	a	femoral to posterior
16516	0	a	tibial graft.
16517	0	a	He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.
16518	0	a	His activity level is 
16519	0	a	limited by his claudication.
16520	0	a	He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 
16521	0	a	treatment.
16522	0	a	At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.
16523	0	a	He gets 
16524	0	a	chest pressure one to
16525	0	a	two times a month.
16526	0	a	However, his activity is extremely limited.
16527	0	a	He reports 
16528	0	a	that he has had a
16529	0	a	positive stress test.
16530	0	a	Further information is not available.
16531	0	a	understands he has coronary
16532	0	a	disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.
16533	0	a	On 
16534	0	a	catheterization he had
16535	0	a	preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
16536	0	a	He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
16537	0	a	after receiving
16538	0	a	chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
16539	0	a	Patient states he will be

16544	0	a	catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 
16545	0	a	therapy.
16546	0	a	On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.
16547	0	a	His blood 
16548	0	a	pressure is 100/72,
16549	0	a	heart rate is 57 bpm.
16550	0	a	HEENT: oropharynx benign.
16551	0	a	Neck: carotids intact 
16552	0	a	bilaterally without
16553	0	a	audible bruits.
16554	0	a	Lungs: distant breath sounds.
16555	0	a	Cor: without obvious jugular 
16556	0	a	venous distention.
16557	0	a	Heart sounds distant.
16558	0	a	Normal S1 and S2.
16559	0	a	No appreciable murmurs.
16560	0	a	Abdomen: 
16561	0	a	unable to palpate
16562	0	a	firm masses or aortic aneurysm.
16563	0	a	Bowel sounds present.
16564	0	a	Extremities: status 
16565	0	a	post surgery to the
16566	0	a	left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.
16567	0	a	Distal pulses are absent.
16568	0	a	Neuro: 
16569	0	a	intact.
16570	0	a	EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.
16571	0	a	IMI with age undetermined.
16572	0	a	Nonspecific STT
16573	0	a	wave abnormalities present.
16574	0	a	No previous EKG for comparison.
16575	0	a	Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 
16576	0	a	artery disease and
16577	0	a	peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
16578	0	a	He 
16579	0	a	clearly has ischemia
16580	0	a	on a positive stress test.
16581	0	a	I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
16582	0	a	check ischemic
16583	0	a	threshold.
16584	0	a	He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
16585	0	a	event.
16586	0	a	However, given
16587	0	a	his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 
16588	0	a	surgery even
16589	0	a	understanding possible complications.
16590	0	a	Plan:
16591	0	a	1.
16592	0	a	Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
16593	0	a	2.
16594	0	a	Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
16595	0	a	control of
16596	0	a	     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 
16597	0	a	dobutamine
16598	0	a	     echocardiography.
16599	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 
16600	0	a	Ogrady.
16601	0	a	Please do

16931	0	a	     MR #892-76-95-4
16932	0	a	Dear Usha:
16933	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
16934	0	a	Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
16935	1	a	hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
16936	0	a	As
16937	0	a	you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night.
16938	0	a	She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
16939	0	a	whenever she takes the quinine.
16940	0	a	She has not been taking this since
16941	0	a	the initial two doses.
16942	0	a	I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
16943	0	a	secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.
16944	0	a	I have told her to eat
16945	0	a	a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
16946	0	a	cramps in the evening.
16947	0	a	In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
16948	0	a	bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.
16949	0	a	There is borderline first
16950	0	a	degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
16951	0	a	from previous tracing.
16952	0	a	We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
16953	0	a	as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.
16954	0	a	She will see me in follow-up in
16955	0	a	three months' time.
16956	0	a	Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
16957	0	a	clinic.
16958	0	a	With warm regards.
16959	0	a	Sincerely,

17091	0	a	Patient Name:  Michael Yee
17092	0	a	PH#:  69044681
17093	0	a	Date/Time:  12/24/94; 2:30 PM
17094	0	a	Attending:  Dr. Quintrell Ferreira
17095	0	a	CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents
17096	0	a	HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.
17097	0	a	He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).
17098	0	a	She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.
17099	0	a	He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.
17100	0	a	His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.
17101	0	a	He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.
17102	0	a	The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.
17103	0	a	We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.
17104	2	a	PMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)

17120	0	a	A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.
17121	0	a	His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.
17122	0	a	He is being managed by ID.
17123	0	a	His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.
17124	0	a	His abdominal CT is pending.
17125	0	a	He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.
17126	0	a	As such, we recommend:
17127	0	a	--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
17128	0	a	--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
17129	0	a	Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
17130	0	a	Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.
17131	0	a	D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.
17132	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

17142	0	a	                                             FPM#:  236-67-03-3
17143	0	a	Dear Dr. Stafford:
17144	0	a	     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
17145	0	a	Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
17146	0	a	as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
17147	0	a	In summary, she is
17148	0	a	a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
17149	0	a	since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.
17150	0	a	By
17151	0	a	report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
17152	0	a	peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.
17153	0	a	In viewing
17154	0	a	her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.
17155	0	a	Her
17156	0	a	three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
17157	0	a	She does,
17158	0	a	however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
17159	3	a	on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
17160	0	a	These episodes are
17161	2	a	relieved by nitroglycerin.
17162	0	a	Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
17163	0	a	walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
17164	0	a	by slowing down.
17165	0	a	In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
17166	0	a	only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.
17167	0	a	cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.
17168	0	a	I don't have
17169	0	a	fractionations and her family history is unknown.
17170	0	a	A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
17171	0	a	ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
17172	0	a	preserved LV size and function.
17173	0	a	She had an exercise tolerance test
17174	0	a	in February of 2085.
17175	0	a	On a modified protocol, she went for less
17176	0	a	than 4 1/2 minutes.
17177	0	a	This is equivalent to not even completing
17178	0	a	stage 1 of the standard Bruce.
17179	0	a	With that, she did develop chest
17180	0	a	pain and had 2 mm of ST depression.
17181	0	a	That study was accompanied by
17182	0	a	both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
17183	0	a	consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
17184	0	a	ischemia.
17185	0	a	As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
17186	2	a	portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
17187	0	a	to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
17188	0	a	That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
17189	0	a	only have the report.
17190	0	a	However, from this report, there was
17191	0	a	preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
17192	0	a	MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
17193	0	a	Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
17194	0	a	proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
17195	0	a	LAD.
17196	0	a	The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
17197	0	a	discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
17198	0	a	The
17199	0	a	right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
17200	0	a	stenosis.
17201	0	a	At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
17202	0	a	therapy.
17203	0	a	Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
17204	0	a	prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
17205	0	a	other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
17206	0	a	daily insulin therapy.
17207	0	a	In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
17208	0	a	have involved the hemodialysis access.
17209	0	a	She has had one pregnancy
17210	0	a	28 years ago without complications.
17211	0	a	I also elicited a history of
17212	0	a	some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
17213	0	a	This
17214	0	a	was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
17215	0	a	On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
17216	0	a	regular, her weight 95 lbs.
17217	0	a	Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
17218	0	a	arm.
17219	0	a	There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
17220	0	a	distended.
17221	0	a	Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained.
17222	0	a	There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
17223	0	a	apex.
17224	0	a	Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
17225	0	a	were without edema.
17226	0	a	The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
17227	0	a	diffuse STT changes.
17228	0	a	There were no pathologic Q waves.
17229	0	a	Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
17230	0	a	transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
17231	0	a	status.
17232	0	a	She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
17233	0	a	shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
17234	0	a	limited functional capacity.
17235	0	a	The coronary angiography reveals a
17236	0	a	presence of multi-vessel disease.
17237	0	a	Even without seeing the primary
17238	0	a	data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
17239	0	a	she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.
17240	0	a	Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
17241	0	a	bypass surgery.
17242	0	a	Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
17243	3	a	with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.
17244	0	a	I
17245	0	a	would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
17246	0	a	10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.
17247	0	a	As
17248	0	a	indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
17249	0	a	suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
17250	2	a	symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
17251	0	a	pressing.
17252	0	a	I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
17253	0	a	her care.
17254	0	a	Sincerely,

17702	0	a	Interval History:
17703	0	a	   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today.
17704	0	a	His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test.
17705	0	a	He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.
17706	4	a	His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia.
17707	0	a	He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.
17708	0	a	Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.
17709	0	a	Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.
17710	0	a	"He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol."
17711	0	a	The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week.
17712	0	a	He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different.
17713	0	a	He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.
17714	0	a	He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.

17746	0	a	We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.
17747	0	a	We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.

17764	2	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.
17765	0	a	I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.
17766	0	a	So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.
17767	0	a	We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.
17768	0	a	These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.
17769	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.
17770	0	a	He had no other complaints.
17771	0	a	His bowel movements are regular.

18145	0	a	Dear Usha:
18146	0	a	I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up
18147	0	a	cardiovascular examination.
18148	0	a	She has been reasonably stable since
18149	0	a	I saw her last in July.
18150	0	a	She has had several episodes of chest
18151	0	a	discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite
18152	0	a	transient.
18153	0	a	The frequency has been less than one time per month.
18154	0	a	The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping
18155	0	a	mall.
18156	0	a	She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
18157	0	a	She has
18158	0	a	not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
18159	0	a	She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying
18160	0	a	transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.
18161	0	a	She
18162	0	a	denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip
18163	0	a	pain with walking.
18164	0	a	She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
18165	0	a	She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.
18166	0	a	Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o.
18167	0	a	b.i.d.,
18168	0	a	nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o.

18183	0	a	and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
18184	0	a	p.r.n.
18185	0	a	On examination she appears well.
18186	0	a	Weight is 142 pounds.
18187	0	a	Blood
18188	0	a	pressure is 140/60.
18189	0	a	Heart rate is 50 and regular.
18190	0	a	Neck veins
18191	0	a	are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.
18192	0	a	There are bilateral carotid
18193	0	a	bruits.
18194	0	a	Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to
18195	0	a	auscultation.
18196	0	a	On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth
18197	0	a	intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
18198	0	a	There is a 1+ left
18199	0	a	ventricular lift.
18200	0	a	The first heart sound is normal.
18201	0	a	The second

18204	0	a	is split physiologically.
18205	0	a	There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic
18206	0	a	murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along
18207	0	a	the left sternal border.
18208	0	a	There is a fourth heart sound at the
18209	0	a	apex.
18210	0	a	Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no
18211	0	a	hepatosplenomegaly.
18212	0	a	Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral
18213	0	a	femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft
18214	0	a	pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis
18215	0	a	pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal
18216	0	a	pulses.
18217	0	a	Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
18218	0	a	AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral
18219	0	a	myocardial infarction.
18220	0	a	There has been no diagnostic change since
18221	0	a	July 18, 2086.
18222	0	a	Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,
18223	0	a	2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
18224	0	a	and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
18225	0	a	The
18226	0	a	velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
18227	0	a	calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
18228	0	a	2086.
18229	0	a	Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left
18230	0	a	femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
18231	0	a	velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
18232	0	a	thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.
18233	0	a	The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent
18234	0	a	with no evidence of significant stenoses.
18235	0	a	In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:
18236	0	a	1.
18237	2	a	Coronary artery disease.
18238	0	a	Status post coronary artery bypass
18239	0	a	surgery.
18240	0	a	LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and
18241	0	a	posterolateral left ventricular branch.
18242	0	a	She has occasional and
18243	3	a	very transient episodes of angina.
18244	0	a	I have suggested continuing
18245	0	a	her current medical regimen.
18246	0	a	As noted previously, I prefer to
18247	0	a	manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.
18248	0	a	2.
18249	0	a	Carotid artery disease.
18250	0	a	She is asymptomatic.
18251	0	a	I recommend
18252	0	a	periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.
18253	0	a	3.
18254	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease.
18255	0	a	Both grafts are patent but the
18256	0	a	left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have
18257	0	a	a significant stenosis.
18258	0	a	I have asked her to discuss this finding
18259	0	a	with you further.
18260	0	a	November 07, 2086              -3-

18286	0	a	HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.
18287	0	a	The 
18288	0	a	patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
18289	2	a	whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
18290	1	a	"which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of "
18291	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.
18292	0	a	As it 
18293	0	a	turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
18294	0	a	beneficial effects of which were unknown.
18295	0	a	We had decided as of our last 
18296	0	a	meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.
18297	0	a	patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
18298	0	a	continue to discontinue this medicine.
18299	0	a	At this point, the patient does 
18300	0	a	not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.
18301	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
18302	0	a	the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
18303	0	a	wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.
18304	0	a	Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.
18305	0	a	It is 
18306	0	a	noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
18307	0	a	the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
18308	0	a	diastolic was 80-90.
18309	0	a	The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
18310	0	a	than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.
18311	0	a	The patient 
18312	0	a	has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
18313	0	a	ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
18314	0	a	remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.
18315	0	a	The patient's 
18316	0	a	cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.
18317	0	a	Review 
18318	0	a	of systems otherwise negative.
18319	0	a	Physical exam is not performed at this time.
18320	0	a	Blood pressure was 152/76 
18321	0	a	on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
18322	0	a	and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
18323	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
18324	0	a	problems coming in for follow-up.
18325	0	a	1.
18326	0	a	Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
18327	0	a	     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
18328	0	a	     hypertrophy.
18329	0	a	The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
18330	0	a	     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
18331	0	a	     standing.
18332	0	a	The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
18333	0	a	     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
18334	0	a	     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.
18335	0	a	If 
18336	0	a	     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
18337	0	a	     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
18338	0	a	2.
18339	0	a	BPH - please see above.
18340	0	a	The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
18341	0	a	3.   ?
18342	2	a	coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
18343	0	a	     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
18344	0	a	     for this gentleman.
18345	0	a	I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
18346	0	a	     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s 
18347	0	a	     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL
18348	0	a	476 Will St                           Vicente, Kadeem
18349	0	a	PAGE 2
18350	0	a	     or low 50s.
18351	0	a	Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
18352	0	a	     therapy.
18353	0	a	I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
18354	0	a	     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
18355	0	a	     will be put on an antilipid drug.
18356	0	a	4.
18357	0	a	GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
18358	0	a	     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
18359	0	a	     point.
18360	0	a	Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
18361	0	a	     placed on Prilosec.
18362	0	a	I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
18363	0	a	his use of Hytrin.

18722	0	a	Dear Margaret,
18723	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in the Cardiology Clinic at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.
18724	1	a	Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.
18725	0	a	She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.
18726	0	a	Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.
18727	0	a	However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.
18728	0	a	She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.
18729	0	a	Current Medications:
18730	0	a	1.

18765	1	a	In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well.
18766	0	a	She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments.
18767	0	a	As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o.
18768	0	a	b.i.d., metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o.
18769	0	a	daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o.
18770	0	a	I will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema.
18771	0	a	We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.
18772	0	a	I will see her again in 2 weeks' time.
18773	0	a	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

18786	0	a	Dear Vernon,
18787	3	a	I write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07/25/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI.
18788	4	a	His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13.
18789	0	a	There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event.
18790	0	a	He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07/26/2060.
18791	0	a	His condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy.
18792	0	a	He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07/26/2060.
18793	4	a	Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch.
18794	1	a	The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent.
18795	1	a	A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty.
18796	0	a	He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure.
18797	0	a	The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07/27/2060 (08:54).
18798	0	a	He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.
18799	0	a	He felt much improved the following day.
18800	0	a	A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75.
18801	0	a	An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA.
18802	0	a	After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.
18803	0	a	He was discharged on the afternoon of 07/27/2060.
18804	0	a	His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., niacin 500 mg b.i.d., ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.
18805	0	a	Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.

19011	2	a	62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.
19012	0	a	This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.
19013	0	a	He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.
19014	0	a	There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.
19015	0	a	There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.
19016	0	a	Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.
19017	0	a	No alteration in medications required.

19208	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
19209	0	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
19210	0	a	depression.
19211	0	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
19212	0	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
19213	0	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
19214	0	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
19215	0	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
19216	0	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
19217	0	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
19218	0	a	study.
19219	0	a	She is scheduled later this month.
19220	0	a	She has no new complaints, 
19221	0	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
19222	0	a	it over the past two days.
19223	0	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
19224	0	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
19225	0	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
19226	0	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
19227	0	a	the morning.
19228	0	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
19229	0	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
19230	0	a	that she has been taking them.
19231	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
19232	0	a	this is true or not.
19233	0	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
19234	0	a	She says 
19235	0	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
19236	0	a	She was recently started on 
19237	0	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
19238	0	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
19239	0	a	a month.
19240	0	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
19241	0	a	She says overall 
19242	0	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
19243	0	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
19244	0	a	We again discussed the 
19245	0	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
19246	3	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
19247	0	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
19248	0	a	frequency.
19249	0	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
19250	0	a	rest.

19252	0	a	Page 2
19253	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
19254	0	a	Her 
19255	0	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
19256	0	a	Her weight today is 
19257	0	a	249lb.
19258	0	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.
19259	0	a	Her JVP is not visible at 90 
19260	0	a	degrees.
19261	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
19262	0	a	Her lungs are clear to 
19263	0	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
19264	0	a	positive S1, S2.
19265	0	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
19266	0	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
19267	0	a	Her finger stick 
19268	0	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
19269	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
19270	0	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
19271	0	a	Diabetes.
19272	0	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
19273	0	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
19274	0	a	Finger stick in the 
19275	0	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
19276	0	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
19277	0	a	     over the past couple of months.
19278	0	a	In any event, she most likely need 
19279	0	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
19280	0	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
19281	0	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
19282	0	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
19283	0	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
19284	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
19285	0	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
19286	0	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
19287	0	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
19288	0	a	Coronary disease.
19289	3	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
19290	0	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
19291	0	a	as she did have room to go 
19292	0	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
19293	0	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
19294	0	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
19295	0	a	Again, reinforced the 
19296	0	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
19297	0	a	     again as I have in the past.
19298	0	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
19299	0	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
19300	0	a	I told her she should take the 
19301	0	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
19302	0	a	Health maintenance.
19303	0	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
19304	0	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
19305	0	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
19306	0	a	Additionally, I 
19307	0	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
19308	0	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
19309	0	a	I also stressed the

19311	0	a	Page 3
19312	0	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
19313	0	a	She says she is scheduled 
19314	0	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
19315	0	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

19767	0	a	  RE:  Adler, Imogene
19768	0	a	  MRN: 618-13-82-6
19769	0	a	  Dear Dr. Yingling:
19770	0	a	  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,
19771	2	a	  for her problem of coronary ischemia.
19772	0	a	As you know, Ms.
19773	0	a	  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of
19774	0	a	  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is
19775	0	a	  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest
19776	0	a	  tightness associated with exertion.
19777	0	a	A stress MIBI SPECT
19778	0	a	  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and
19779	0	a	  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex
19780	0	a	  distribution.
19781	0	a	The details of the study include an exercise
19782	0	a	  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and
19783	0	a	  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from
19784	0	a	  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and
19785	0	a	  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a
19786	0	a	  rate pressure product of 33,390).
19787	0	a	The test was stopped due
19788	3	a	  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.
19789	0	a	EKG
19790	0	a	  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and
19791	0	a	  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.
19792	0	a	Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her
19793	0	a	  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and
19794	0	a	  verapamil 240mg q.d.
19795	0	a	A recent lipid panel demonstrated a
19796	0	a	  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.
19797	0	a	On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing
19798	0	a	  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute
19799	0	a	  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.
19800	0	a	Jugular
19801	0	a	  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.
19802	0	a	Carotids
19803	0	a	  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.
19804	0	a	Chest
19805	0	a	  examination was clear to auscultation.
19806	0	a	Heart examination
19807	0	a	  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split
19808	0	a	  S2, no murmurs or rubs.
19809	0	a	Abdominal examination was 
19810	0	a	  Page 2
19811	0	a	  unremarkable.
19812	0	a	Peripheral examination demonstrated no
19813	0	a	  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
19814	0	a	EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
19815	0	a	  EKG.
19816	0	a	I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
19817	0	a	  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
19818	0	a	  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
19819	3	a	  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
19820	0	a	We reviewed the
19821	0	a	  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
19822	0	a	  angiography and possible angioplasty.
19823	0	a	I made no solid
19824	0	a	  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty
19825	0	a	  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
19826	0	a	  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
19827	0	a	  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and
19828	0	a	  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
19829	0	a	  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
19830	0	a	  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
19831	0	a	  tolerance.
19832	0	a	She and her husband are going to reflect on
19833	0	a	  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the
19834	0	a	  week.
19835	0	a	If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography
19836	0	a	  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately
19837	0	a	  in Cardiology.
19838	0	a	I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see
19839	0	a	  her in the office.
19840	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if
19841	0	a	  I can be of any further assistance.
19842	0	a	With warm regards,

19856	0	a	three nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 
19857	0	a	system.
19858	0	a	Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of 
19859	0	a	ST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6.
19860	0	a	This is 
19861	0	a	comparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may 
19862	0	a	have been her most recent presentation with ischemia.
19863	0	a	She was 
19864	0	a	given aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the 
19865	0	a	Emergency Department.
19866	0	a	The total duration of pain was approximately 
19867	0	a	two hours.
19868	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs remained stable.

20334	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 
20335	0	a	for follow up regarding her diabetes.
20336	0	a	Since I last saw her, she 
20337	0	a	has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 
20338	0	a	October.
20339	0	a	Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 
20340	0	a	repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 
20341	0	a	essentially within normal limits.
20342	0	a	She denies any recurrent flank 
20343	0	a	pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.
20344	0	a	Says overall she is feeling 
20345	0	a	relatively well.
20346	0	a	She is taking all of her medications as 
20347	0	a	prescribed.
20348	0	a	She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 
20349	0	a	fatigue, or blurry vision.
20350	0	a	She continues to smoke.
20351	0	a	She has not 
20352	0	a	been exercising.
20353	0	a	She also continues to have intermittent chest 
20354	0	a	pain of unclear etiology.
20355	0	a	Several days ago, she had an episode 
20356	0	a	that lasted a minute or two at rest.
20357	0	a	She described it as a 
20358	0	a	tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 
20359	0	a	nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.
20360	0	a	She has 
20361	0	a	no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 
20362	0	a	symptoms in the past few days.
20363	0	a	She has not been taking her blood 
20364	0	a	sugars at home as her machine is broken.
20365	0	a	Also, she self-
20366	0	a	discontinued her lisinopril.
20367	0	a	She thought it gave her a headache.
20368	0	a	Page 2
20369	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 
20370	0	a	distress.
20371	0	a	Pulse 68 and regular.
20372	0	a	Blood pressure 134/84 and 
20373	0	a	weight 226.
20374	0	a	Fingerstick today 198.
20375	0	a	Neck veins are non-elevated.
20376	0	a	No carotid bruits.
20377	0	a	Oropharynx is clear.
20378	0	a	Lungs are clear to 
20379	0	a	auscultation bilaterally.
20380	0	a	Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.
20381	0	a	Normal S1 and S2.
20382	0	a	No murmurs.
20383	0	a	Extremities are warm and without 
20384	0	a	edema.
20385	0	a	Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 
20386	0	a	vibration and light touch.
20387	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 
20388	0	a	normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-
20389	0	a	waves.
20390	0	a	Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
20391	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
20392	0	a	problems as follows:
20393	0	a	Type 2 diabetes.
20394	0	a	Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
20395	0	a	the 9.0.
20396	0	a	She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
20397	0	a	try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
20398	0	a	At this point, it 
20399	0	a	is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
20400	0	a	regimen starting with b.i.d.
20401	0	a	NPH, and we will refer her to the 
20402	0	a	diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 
20403	0	a	with a plan to transition her at that time.
20404	0	a	Her urine 
20405	0	a	microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
20406	0	a	We will recheck 
20407	0	a	her hemoglobin A1c today.
20408	0	a	She has been to the ophthalmologist 
20409	0	a	recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
20410	0	a	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 
20411	0	a	pain is somewhat concerning.
20412	0	a	She does have coronary disease 
20413	0	a	as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
20414	0	a	She is taking an 
20415	0	a	aspirin and a beta-blocker.
20416	0	a	Her EKG today is normal, and she 
20417	0	a	has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
20418	0	a	exertion.
20419	0	a	Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 
20420	0	a	pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
20421	0	a	the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 
20422	0	a	and beta-blocker.
20423	0	a	I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
20424	0	a	ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
20425	0	a	referring her to Cardiology.

20427	0	a	"	11/24/94"
20428	0	a	"	Page 3"
20429	0	a	"	"
20430	0	a	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 
20431	0	a	prefer better blood pressure control.
20432	0	a	She agreed to try the 
20433	0	a	lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 
20434	0	a	thinks it disagrees with her.
20435	0	a	I told her I felt the headache 
20436	0	a	was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
20437	0	a	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 
20438	0	a	I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 
20439	0	a	today without receiving one.
20440	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

20495	0	a	Recs:
20496	0	a	Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
20497	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
20498	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
20499	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.

21461	3	a	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest discomfort.
21462	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 
21463	0	a	who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the 
21464	0	a	night, last night, and into today.
21465	0	a	He finally took nitroglycerin 
21466	0	a	tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest 
21467	0	a	discomfort.
21468	0	a	The patient has known history of coronary artery 
21469	2	a	disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, 
21470	0	a	however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more 
21471	0	a	tire than usual.
21472	0	a	He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 
21473	0	a	rested throughout the rest of the day.
21474	0	a	Then last night, he had 
21475	0	a	some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of.
21476	0	a	Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 
21477	0	a	morning hours.
21478	0	a	He felt he was wheezing.
21479	0	a	This resolved after he 
21480	0	a	got up and walked around.
21481	0	a	He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 
21482	0	a	morning.
21483	0	a	These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 
21484	0	a	obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.
21485	0	a	He then came in 
21486	0	a	to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the 
21487	0	a	emergency department for evaluation.
21488	0	a	Please see the handwritten 
21489	0	a	emergency department record for additional details.
21490	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease 
21491	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency 
21492	0	a	department record.
21493	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not 
21494	0	a	tachypneic.
21495	0	a	His blood pressure is 160/80.
21496	0	a	His heart rate is in 
21497	0	a	the 50s.
21498	0	a	There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on 
21499	0	a	examination.
21500	0	a	There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs 
21501	0	a	are clear to auscultation.
21502	0	a	His heart examination is distant, with 
21503	0	a	no murmurs or gallops appreciated.
21504	0	a	His extremities have trace 
21505	0	a	edema.
21506	0	a	Abdomen in soft and non-tender.
21507	0	a	Pulses are equal.
21508	0	a	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle 
21509	0	a	branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous 
21510	0	a	tracings.
21511	0	a	His other laboratory studies are pending.
21512	0	a	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his 
21513	0	a	physician, Dr. Echeverria.
21514	0	a	We both agree that the patient has 
21515	0	a	probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible 
21516	0	a	unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and 
21517	0	a	paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
21518	0	a	It is possible that he has silent 
21519	0	a	ischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch 
21520	0	a	pattern.
21521	0	a	Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being 
21522	0	a	sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for 
21523	0	a	further medical management.
21524	0	a	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery 
21525	2	a	disease.
21526	0	a	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
21527	0	a	admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

23619	0	a	Dear Dr.  Morgan:
23620	2	a	  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.
23621	0	a	She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago.
23622	0	a	She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD.
23623	0	a	She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine.
23624	0	a	She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler.
23625	0	a	With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.
23626	0	a	She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time.
23627	0	a	These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week.
23628	0	a	She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.
23629	0	a	To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
23630	0	a	This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery.
23631	0	a	There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery.
23632	0	a	She was then referred to me for further evaluation.
23633	0	a	Past medical history:
23634	0	a	   Hypertension.
23635	0	a	Hyperlipidemia.
23636	0	a	Glucose intolerance.

23673	0	a	Physical examination:
23674	0	a	-Pulse:   70
23675	0	a	-BP: 142/70  
23676	0	a	-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest
23677	0	a	-Skin:   Free of rashes
23678	0	a	-Heent:   benign
23679	0	a	-Neck:   JVP was at 5.

23687	0	a	"			EKG:"
23688	0	a	    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.
23689	0	a	Assessment and plan:
23690	0	a	   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past.
23691	0	a	She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy.
23692	0	a	Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm.
23693	0	a	I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan.
23694	0	a	She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.
23695	0	a	Plan: 
23696	0	a	1.
23697	0	a	Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.
23698	0	a	2.
23699	0	a	Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.
23700	0	a	3.
23701	0	a	I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
23702	0	a	4.
23703	0	a	I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

24170	0	a	s/p XRT to esophagus
24171	0	a	Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 
24172	0	a	History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
24173	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
24174	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
24175	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
24176	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
24177	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
24178	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
24179	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
24180	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
24181	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
24182	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
24183	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
24184	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
24185	0	a	He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.
24186	0	a	He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
24187	0	a	He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.
24188	0	a	No bleeding.
24189	0	a	He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest.
24190	0	a	He is fatigued.

24270	0	a	HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.
24271	0	a	He is status post TURP by Dr. 
24272	0	a	Nixon.
24273	0	a	He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
24274	0	a	thinks that this should get better.
24275	0	a	We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
24276	0	a	range.
24277	0	a	We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
24278	0	a	that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
24279	0	a	dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
24280	0	a	He has remained on digoxin status 
24281	1	a	post his myocardial infarction.
24282	0	a	We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
24283	0	a	We also have been concerned 
24284	0	a	that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
24285	0	a	about his wife's situation with breast cancer.
24286	0	a	We had a long discussion 
24287	0	a	about this.
24288	0	a	Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.
24289	0	a	His blood pressure was 178/80.
24290	0	a	The follow-up was 170/80.
24291	0	a	His neck was 
24292	0	a	supple.
24293	0	a	Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.
24294	0	a	Cardiac 
24295	0	a	exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
24296	0	a	Abdomen 
24297	0	a	was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
24298	0	a	Extremities were 
24299	0	a	clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
24300	0	a	Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
24301	0	a	negative.
24302	0	a	Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.
24303	0	a	Platelets were within normal 
24304	0	a	limits.
24305	0	a	White count is 8.3.
24306	0	a	Digoxin is 0.9.
24307	0	a	Lytes are within normal 
24308	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
24309	0	a	1.
24310	0	a	Status post TURP.
24311	0	a	He appears to be recovering well.
24312	0	a	He has had 
24313	0	a	     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
24314	0	a	2.
24315	0	a	Thrombocytopenia.
24316	0	a	This was very relative.
24317	0	a	It now appears to have 
24318	0	a	     resolved.
24319	0	a	3.
24320	2	a	Coronary artery disease.
24321	0	a	As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
24322	0	a	     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.
24323	0	a	At 
24324	0	a	     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
24325	0	a	     Lasix.
24326	0	a	However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
24327	0	a	     treatment with anti-anginals.
24328	0	a	4.
24329	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
24330	0	a	This has been well-controlled recently.
24331	0	a	His

24333	0	a	5.
24334	0	a	Depression.
24335	0	a	He continues on Ambien.
24336	0	a	He has some discretion about 
24337	0	a	     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
24338	0	a	     uncertainty resolved.

24373	0	a	HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.
24374	0	a	The patient 
24375	0	a	is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
24376	1	a	coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
24377	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.
24378	0	a	The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.
24379	0	a	With regard to the 
24380	0	a	latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
24381	0	a	initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
24382	0	a	notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
24383	0	a	uncomfortable with this.
24384	0	a	He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
24385	0	a	pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
24386	0	a	of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.
24387	0	a	The patient knows the foods that give 
24388	0	a	him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
24389	0	a	avoid them as much as possible.
24390	0	a	The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
24391	0	a	which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
24392	0	a	would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
24393	0	a	blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
24394	0	a	we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).
24395	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
24396	0	a	the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
24397	0	a	of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.
24398	0	a	The patient does remain on 
24399	0	a	Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
24400	0	a	pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
24401	0	a	minutes later was 130/74.
24402	0	a	The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.
24403	0	a	No positive 
24404	0	a	review of systems.
24405	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.
24406	0	a	Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me 
24407	0	a	was 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, 
24408	0	a	respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.
24409	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  75 year old man with multiple medical concerns 
24410	0	a	comes in for follow up.

24412	0	a	Hypertension.
24413	0	a	The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as 
24414	0	a	     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.
24415	0	a	His blood pressure 
24416	0	a	     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
24417	0	a	One of the issues 
24418	0	a	     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.
24419	0	a	"The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and "
24420	2	a	     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
24421	0	a	     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
24422	0	a	     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
24423	0	a	     Zestril with a beta-blocker.
24424	0	a	2.
24425	0	a	GERD.
24426	0	a	The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg 
24427	0	a	     to be taken at bedtime.

24433	0	a	     months, although he should be able to experience relief almost 
24434	0	a	     immediately.
24435	0	a	The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which 
24436	0	a	     may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux.

24438	0	a	BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to 
24439	0	a	     be working quite well.
24440	0	a	The patient notes that there is less 
24441	0	a	     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.
24442	0	a	The patient does take Lasix 
24443	0	a	     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any 
24444	0	a	     difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.

24450	0	a	The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
24451	0	a	     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG 
24452	0	a	     changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he 
24453	0	a	     would like to stay on this.
24454	0	a	Patient has enough to last until I see 
24455	0	a	     him next time.
24456	0	a	I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
24457	0	a	patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.
24458	0	a	The cholesterol 
24459	0	a	is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the 
24460	0	a	patient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to 
24461	0	a	treatment.

24879	0	a	Dear Dr. Keller,
24880	0	a	Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
24881	0	a	Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
24882	0	a	We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
24883	2	a	"HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband."
24884	0	a	This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.
24885	0	a	She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
24886	0	a	In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
24887	0	a	The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.
24888	0	a	In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.
24889	0	a	She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.

24893	0	a	She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.
24894	0	a	Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.
24895	0	a	CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
24896	0	a	She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.
24897	0	a	Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.
24898	0	a	She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.
24899	0	a	ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
24900	0	a	Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).
24901	0	a	She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.
24902	0	a	Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.
24903	0	a	In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.

24976	2	a	Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.
24977	0	a	Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.
24978	0	a	At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
24979	0	a	Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.
24980	0	a	We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.
24981	0	a	She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.
24982	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
24983	0	a	We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

26022	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
26023	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
26024	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
26025	0	a	Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
26026	0	a	She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.
26027	0	a	This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.
26028	0	a	Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
26029	0	a	Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.
26030	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
26031	0	a	She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.
26032	0	a	She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.
26033	1	a	Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.
26034	0	a	She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.
26035	0	a	Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.
26036	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
26037	0	a	Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
26038	0	a	However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.
26039	0	a	She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.
26040	0	a	She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.
26041	0	a	She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.
26042	0	a	She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.
26043	0	a	She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
26044	0	a	"She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

26114	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
26115	0	a	58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
26116	0	a	She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.
26117	0	a	We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
26118	0	a	The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.
26119	0	a	If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.
26120	0	a	However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.
26121	0	a	Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.
26122	0	a	Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
26123	0	a	Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.
26124	0	a	I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.
26125	0	a	She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
26126	0	a	If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.
26127	0	a	Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.
26128	0	a	Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.
26129	0	a	Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
26130	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
26131	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
26132	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.

26277	0	a	CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis
26278	0	a	HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
26279	0	a	This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time.
26280	1	a	Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074.
26281	3	a	Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG.
26282	0	a	In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal.
26283	0	a	She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD.
26284	0	a	She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.
26285	0	a	Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position.
26286	0	a	She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea.
26287	0	a	She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain.

26431	0	a	Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,
26432	0	a	  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse.
26433	0	a	She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure.
26434	0	a	About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable.
26435	0	a	She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols.
26436	0	a	She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson.
26437	0	a	She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home.
26438	0	a	She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top.
26439	0	a	She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness.
26440	0	a	She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.

27085	0	a	down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.
27086	0	a	She
27087	0	a	feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
27088	0	a	says that her blood sugars have been quite high.
27089	0	a	She does
27090	0	a	have diabetes.
27091	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.
27092	0	a	Her
27093	0	a	blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a
27094	0	a	pulse of 64.
27095	0	a	Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal
27096	0	a	without bruit.
27097	0	a	Heart is not enlarged.
27098	0	a	There is a regular
27099	0	a	sinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.
27100	0	a	Liver and spleen
27101	0	a	are not felt.
27102	0	a	EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
27103	0	a	myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
27104	0	a	last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
27105	0	a	precordium.
27106	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction.
27107	0	a	Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
27108	0	a	think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
27109	0	a	ward and attend her there.

28100	0	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
28101	0	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
28102	0	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
28103	0	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
28104	0	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
28105	0	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
28106	0	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
28107	0	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
28108	0	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

28271	0	a	Post, IN  86454
28272	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
28273	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
28274	1	a	As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.
28275	1	a	He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.
28276	1	a	Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.
28277	0	a	Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.
28278	1	a	He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.
28279	1	a	He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.
28280	0	a	Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.
28281	0	a	He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.
28282	0	a	Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
28283	0	a	As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.
28284	0	a	He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.
28285	0	a	He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
28286	0	a	Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).
28287	0	a	Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
28288	0	a	He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
28289	0	a	His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o.
28290	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
28291	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
28292	0	a	daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o.
28293	0	a	daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o.
28294	0	a	daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
28295	0	a	daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily.
28296	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
28297	0	a	Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.
28298	0	a	He is in no distress.
28299	0	a	Weight is 221 lbs.
28300	0	a	Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.
28301	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.
28302	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
28303	0	a	His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
28304	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
28305	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
28306	0	a	He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.
28307	0	a	EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.
28308	0	a	We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
28309	0	a	He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
28310	0	a	His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL.
28311	0	a	His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.
28312	0	a	HbA1c is 7.2%.
28313	0	a	The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.
28314	0	a	Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
28315	0	a	To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:
28316	0	a	1.
28317	0	a	Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.
28318	0	a	2.
28319	0	a	Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.
28320	0	a	Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
28321	0	a	3.
28322	0	a	He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.
28323	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.
28324	0	a	As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.
28325	0	a	The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.
28326	0	a	Yours sincerely,

28867	0	a	Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
28868	0	a	Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
28869	0	a	A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 
28870	0	a	""" Hematoma around right subclavian artery."
28871	0	a	Narrowing of the artery.
28872	0	a	Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.
28873	0	a	"If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained."""
28874	0	a	On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
28875	0	a	His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses.
28876	0	a	There are no thrills or bruits.
28877	0	a	My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:
28878	0	a	1).
28879	0	a	Hematoma- to be expected
28880	0	a	2).
28881	0	a	Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
28882	0	a	3).
28883	0	a	Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
28884	0	a	4).
28885	0	a	Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
28886	0	a	Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
28887	0	a	This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
28888	0	a	If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it.
28889	0	a	He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
28890	0	a	There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

28965	0	a	Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.
28966	0	a	Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.
28967	0	a	Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.
28968	0	a	If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.

28979	3	a	   Mr Eubanks presents for hospital followup after presenting to BBH in January 2149 w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.
28980	3	a	On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.
28981	0	a	Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care.
28982	3	a	In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved.

29153	0	a	Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098
29154	0	a	ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
29155	0	a	Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
29156	0	a	History of Present Illness:
29157	0	a	"	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery."
29158	0	a	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.
29159	0	a	If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
29160	0	a	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
29161	0	a	Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
29162	0	a	His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.
29163	0	a	A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
29164	0	a	There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
29165	0	a	The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).
29166	0	a	An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
29167	0	a	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
29168	0	a	He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
29169	0	a	He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.
29170	0	a	He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
29171	0	a	He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.
29172	0	a	His lasix dose has not changed.
29173	3	a	He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
29174	0	a	He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.
29175	0	a	A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

29261	0	a	Impression and Plan:
29262	0	a	This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
29263	0	a	The issues include:
29264	0	a	Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
29265	0	a	I would consider:
29266	0	a	increasing his diuretic (eg.

29268	0	a	Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
29269	0	a	He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
29270	0	a	consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
29271	0	a	consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
29272	1	a	Prevention of periperative MI
29273	0	a	He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
29274	3	a	No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
29275	0	a	Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
29276	0	a	Prevention of perioperative AF
29277	0	a	Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
29278	0	a	Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
29279	0	a	Endocarditis prophylaxis
29280	0	a	He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
29281	0	a	We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.
