351	0	a	   Mr.  Lilly is generally doing well.
352	0	a	His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes.

354	0	a	For now, we will sit tight.
355	0	a	He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr.  Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.
356	0	a	Plan: Monitor blood pressure.
357	0	a	Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor.

636	0	a	HCC# - 367-41-93
637	0	a	Dear Dr. Uher:
638	0	a	I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.
639	0	a	As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.
640	1	a	He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.
641	0	a	He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.
642	0	a	Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.
643	0	a	He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.
644	0	a	I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.
645	0	a	On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.
646	0	a	His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.
647	0	a	His lungs were clear bilaterally.
648	0	a	He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.
649	0	a	His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.
650	0	a	Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.
651	0	a	I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.
652	0	a	If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.
653	0	a	Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.
654	0	a	Sincerely,

950	0	a	,  
951	0	a	Dear Dr.  Osuna:
952	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.
953	1	a	As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.
954	1	a	He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.
955	0	a	His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.
956	0	a	He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.
957	0	a	Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.
958	0	a	He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.
959	0	a	He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.
960	0	a	He is no longer using a CPAP.
961	0	a	Current Medications:
962	0	a	  aspirin 325 mg qd
963	0	a	 Diovan 80 mg qd
964	0	a	 Imdur 30 mg qd

985	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.
986	0	a	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
987	0	a	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes
988	0	a	-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border
989	0	a	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
990	0	a	No organomegaly.
991	0	a	No pulsatile masses
992	0	a	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
993	0	a	He has trace pedal edema bilaterally
994	0	a	Procedures:
995	0	a	Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.
996	0	a	concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
997	0	a	Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.
998	0	a	Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.
999	4	a	Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.
1000	0	a	The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.
1001	0	a	EKG:
1002	1	a	    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.
1003	0	a	Assessment and plan:
1004	1	a	   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution.
1005	0	a	There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique.
1006	0	a	I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease.
1007	0	a	Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm.
1008	0	a	We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

1169	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
1170	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.
1171	0	a	Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.
1172	0	a	By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.
1173	0	a	She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.
1174	0	a	In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.
1175	0	a	Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.
1176	0	a	Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.
1177	0	a	Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.
1178	0	a	In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.
1179	0	a	Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.
1180	0	a	Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o.
1181	0	a	daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
1182	0	a	daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
1183	0	a	daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
1184	0	a	b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o.
1185	0	a	b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
1186	0	a	daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o.
1187	0	a	daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.
1188	0	a	and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.
1189	0	a	Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.
1190	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.
1191	0	a	The neck is supple.
1192	0	a	JVP is flat.
1193	0	a	Carotids are without significant bruits.
1194	0	a	Chest remains clear.
1195	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.
1196	0	a	No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
1197	0	a	The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.
1198	0	a	Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.
1199	0	a	Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.
1200	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.
1201	1	a	There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
1202	0	a	Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.
1203	0	a	Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.
1204	0	a	I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o.
1205	0	a	daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.
1206	0	a	I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.
1207	0	a	She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.
1208	0	a	Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.
1209	0	a	She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.
1210	0	a	She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.
1211	0	a	In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.
1212	0	a	At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.
1213	0	a	Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.
1214	0	a	I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
1215	0	a	Sincerely yours,

1229	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
1230	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.
1231	0	a	While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.
1232	1	a	He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.
1233	1	a	MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.
1234	1	a	He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.
1235	1	a	After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.
1236	0	a	Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
1237	0	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
1238	0	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
1239	0	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.
1240	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
1241	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.
1242	0	a	He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.
1243	0	a	He feels well, and has had no problems.
1244	0	a	He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.
1245	0	a	He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.
1246	0	a	He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.
1247	0	a	His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.
1248	0	a	His past medical history includes:
1249	1	a	 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
1250	1	a	 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
1251	0	a	 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
1252	0	a	 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
1253	0	a	 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
1254	0	a	 hypothyroid
1255	0	a	 basal cell skin CA
1256	0	a	 nephrolithiasis
1257	0	a	His medications include:
1258	0	a	 Lipitor 80 mg
1259	0	a	 Plavix 75 mg
1260	0	a	 ASA 325 mg po QD
1261	0	a	 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
1262	0	a	 Prilosec 20 mg
1263	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
1264	0	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
1265	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.
1266	0	a	He is now back at work.
1267	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
1268	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
1269	0	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
1270	0	a	He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.
1271	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.
1272	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
1273	0	a	His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.
1274	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
1275	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
1276	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
1277	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
1278	1	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
1279	0	a	He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.
1280	0	a	His recent cardiac tests include: 
1281	0	a	 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
1282	1	a	 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 
1283	1	a	In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.
1284	0	a	He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.
1285	0	a	Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.
1286	0	a	Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.
1287	0	a	Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.
1288	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
1289	0	a	I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.
1290	0	a	We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.
1291	0	a	Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.
1292	0	a	Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.
1293	0	a	At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.
1294	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
1295	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
1296	0	a	Regards,

1648	0	a	RE:  Otis Narvaez
1649	0	a	     MR #045-61-32-6
1650	0	a	Dear Uddin:
1651	0	a	Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
1652	0	a	undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.
1653	0	a	His previous visit with me occurred on
1654	0	a	February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.
1655	0	a	He
1656	0	a	"denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion."
1657	0	a	This was not
1658	0	a	associated with activity.
1659	0	a	He admits to being a very sedentary person.
1660	0	a	The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
1661	0	a	LV function, and CT coronary angiography.
1662	0	a	There were no significant findings on the clinical
1663	0	a	evaluation.
1664	0	a	The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion.
1665	0	a	The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
1666	0	a	limiting stenosis.
1667	0	a	There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
1668	0	a	was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging.
1669	0	a	There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.
1670	0	a	The
1671	4	a	narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.
1672	0	a	A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
1673	0	a	cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
1674	0	a	342 mg/dl.
1675	0	a	He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.
1676	0	a	He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
1677	0	a	insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.
1678	0	a	Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.
1679	0	a	denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.
1680	0	a	His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
1681	0	a	Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
1682	0	a	Otis Narvaez
1683	0	a	MR #045-61-32-6
1684	0	a	Page 2
1685	0	a	aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.
1686	0	a	He usually takes these once every other day.
1687	0	a	He is
1688	0	a	now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.
1689	0	a	He takes this at bedtime.
1690	0	a	Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.
1691	0	a	This causes him
1692	0	a	to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.
1693	0	a	He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.
1694	0	a	He also has chronic low
1695	0	a	back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.
1696	0	a	He also has
1697	0	a	degenerative joint disease in his knees.
1698	0	a	He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
1699	0	a	depression.
1700	0	a	He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.
1701	0	a	On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
1702	0	a	cell carcinoma.
1703	0	a	On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.
1704	0	a	His
1705	0	a	weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
1706	0	a	the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.
1707	0	a	Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
1708	0	a	reveals upper dentures in place.
1709	0	a	There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear.
1710	0	a	There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.
1711	0	a	On cardiac examination, the heart
1712	0	a	sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
1713	0	a	rubs, or gallops.
1714	0	a	The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
1715	0	a	distal right calf.
1716	0	a	There is no edema noted.
1717	0	a	I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
1718	0	a	catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.
1719	0	a	He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
1720	0	a	Kraft will perform the procedure.
1721	0	a	His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
1722	0	a	catheterization.
1723	0	a	After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
1724	0	a	comprehensive metabolic profile performed.
1725	0	a	He will return to see me in the office again in one
1726	0	a	month.
1727	0	a	Best personal regards.

2179	0	a	been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
2180	0	a	150 all the way up to 450.
2181	0	a	We have made some adjustments recently in 
2182	0	a	her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
2183	0	a	Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
2184	0	a	been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
2185	0	a	medicines without problems.
2186	0	a	She does note that she is having some pain 
2187	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
2188	0	a	The 
2189	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
2190	0	a	wanes over time.

2206	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
2207	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
2208	0	a	edema.

2212	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
2213	0	a	There 
2214	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.

2217	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.

2221	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
2222	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it

2226	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
2227	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
2228	0	a	She is 
2229	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
2230	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
2231	0	a	I have discussed this 
2232	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
2233	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
2234	0	a	I will talk 
2235	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
2236	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
2237	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
2238	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
2239	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
2240	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
2241	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

2515	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
2516	1	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
2517	0	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
2518	0	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
2519	0	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
2520	0	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
2521	2	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
2522	1	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
2523	0	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
2524	2	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
2525	0	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2526	0	a	daily lifelong.
2527	0	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
2528	0	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
2529	0	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
2530	0	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
2531	0	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
2532	0	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
2533	0	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
2534	0	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
2535	0	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
2536	0	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
2537	0	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2538	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
2539	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
2540	0	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
2541	0	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
2542	0	a	b.i.d.
2543	0	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
2544	0	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
2545	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
2546	0	a	There are no bruits.
2547	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
2548	0	a	He was not clubbed.
2549	0	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
2550	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
2551	0	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
2552	0	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
2553	0	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
2554	0	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
2555	0	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
2556	0	a	TSH was also normal.
2557	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
2558	0	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
2559	0	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
2560	0	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
2561	1	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
2562	0	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
2563	0	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
2564	0	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
2565	0	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
2566	0	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
2567	2	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
2568	0	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
2569	0	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
2570	0	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
2571	0	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
2572	0	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
2573	0	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
2574	0	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
2575	0	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
2576	0	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
2577	0	a	Yours sincerely,

3460	0	a	ESH #:033-98-74
3461	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.
3462	2	a	As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.
3463	0	a	We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.
3464	0	a	She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.
3465	0	a	She is walking each day.
3466	0	a	Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.

3469	0	a	She is sleeping well.
3470	0	a	Her incisions have healed nicely.

3472	0	a	Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.
3473	0	a	I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.
3474	0	a	Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

3523	0	a	her medications as is.
