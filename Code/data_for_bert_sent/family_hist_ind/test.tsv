7	     MR#471-90-84-7
8	Dear Dr. Geiger:
9	Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a
10	preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071.
11	As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
12	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
13	She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and
14	brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has
15	increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
16	she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September
17	of this year.
18	In terms of her cardiac history, she was well
19	until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath
20	and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart
21	failure.
22	At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which
23	revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to
24	shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a
25	dilated left ventricle.
26	In addition, she had an echo in June of
27	2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral
28	regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
29	She has never been hospitalized since that time for her
30	congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good
31	result.
32	She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or
33	claudication.
34	She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
35	In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her
36	recollection.
37	She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house
38	and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs.
39	She is
40	able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty
41	from chest

44	pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops
45	secondary to fatigue.
46	Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
47	CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
48	She has never had
49	surgery.
50	Her family history is significant for a mother who died
51	of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
52	Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for
53	40 years and quit four years ago.
54	She denies alcohol, intravenous
55	drugs or cocaine use.
56	She lives with her husband and briefly
57	worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.
58	She
59	has no known drug allergies.
60	Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril
61	50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po
62	QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily
63	and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.
64	On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in
65	her left arm and 165/70 in her right.
66	Her heart rate was 104 when
67	I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today.
68	Her JVP was 7
69	centimeters.
70	Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid
71	bruits.
72	Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
73	Her
74	heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with
75	occasional ectopic beats.
76	She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6
77	systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without
78	radiation.
79	Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
80	extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
81	Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
82	She has a
83	diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin
84	effects.
85	She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old
86	anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
87	In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
88	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
89	with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,
90	likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial
91	infarction, although she has never undergone heart
92	catheterization.
93	She is currently undergoing evaluation for a
94	thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
95	MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071
96	Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 
97	given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
98	since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with
99	imaging.
100	If this is similar to her previous study showing only
101	fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she
102	will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative
103	myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is
104	well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having
105	Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection
106	fraction.
107	She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection
108	As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation
109	and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or
110	rhythm.
111	Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days
112	prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after
113	surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons
114	as to how may days she should wait after surgery before
115	restarting that medication.
116	She will otherwise remain on her
117	current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and
118	primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.
119	If her stress test
120	is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for
121	further evaluation.
122	Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
123	She was seen
124	and examined with Dr. Voss.
125	Sincerely,

217	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
218	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
219	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
220	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
221	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
222	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
223	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
224	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
225	He never developed chest pain.
226	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
227	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
228	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
229	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
230	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
231	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
232	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
233	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
234	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
235	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
236	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
237	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
238	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
239	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.

802	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
803	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
804	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
805	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
806	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
807	-Telemetry
808	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
809	-If positive will start heparin gtt
810	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
811	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
812	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix
813	-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)
814	#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs.
815	The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease.
816	Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP.
817	Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct.
818	-f/u smear
819	-monitor CBC
820	#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival
821	-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)
822	#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose
823	-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123
824	-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM
825	#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7
826	-FSBG AC+HS
827	-RISS AC
828	#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.
829	-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70
830	-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine
831	-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection
832	#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response
833	-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)
834	#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs
835	-Urine tox
836	-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings
837	-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation
838	-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624
839	-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital
840	-Continue methadone while in house
841	#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin
842	-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)
843	#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2

877	Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia.
878	Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.
879	Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather.
880	Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.
881	On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.
882	He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.
883	SDU Course:
884	For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.

1007	"Re:	Russell Urban	"
1008	"WRH#	4722064	"
1009	Dear Dr. Ussery:
1010	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
1011	As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.
1012	He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
1013	By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.
1014	He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.
1015	That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
1016	He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
1017	The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
1018	Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
1019	He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
1020	This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
1021	A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
1022	He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
1023	A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.
1024	This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
1025	His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
1026	Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
1027	He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
1028	Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
1029	He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
1030	He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.
1031	He has felt very well.
1032	He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
1033	His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
1034	Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
1035	He was evaluated and released.
1036	He never had any further testing.
1037	He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
1038	Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
1039	His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.
1040	He has no known drug allergies.
1041	Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
1042	He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
1043	He has been working in Borders.
1044	He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.
1045	He has no children.
1046	He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
1047	He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
1048	He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
1049	On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.
1050	His heart rate is 60 and regular.
1051	In general, he is in no apparent distress.
1052	His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
1053	His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
1054	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
1055	He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
1056	His abdomen is benign.
1057	His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
1058	On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
1059	His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
1060	His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
1061	The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
1062	His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
1063	His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.
1064	His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
1065	He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
1066	Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
1067	He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.
1068	His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
1069	His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
1070	There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
1071	His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
1072	In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
1073	Also, his systolic function has improved over time.
1074	I think there are two processes going on.
1075	One is coronary artery disease.
1076	Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
1077	The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
1078	Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
1079	He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.
1080	I suspect that this is myocarditis.
1081	Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
1082	It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
1083	From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.
1084	He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.
1085	For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
1086	His LDL goal will be less than 100.
1087	He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.
1088	His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
1089	I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
1090	I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
1091	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
1092	The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.
1093	Sincerely,

1106	"History of Present Illness	"
1107	     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93.
1108	He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward.
1109	Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.
1110	He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia.
1111	EF at that time was 51%.
1112	He has done reasonably well since then.
1113	In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion.
1114	He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95.
1115	EKG was positive for ischemia.
1116	Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia.
1117	His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.
1118	Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA.
1119	Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions.
1120	His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results.
1121	He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

1206	Syncope
1207	HPI: 
1208	Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.
1209	Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099.
1210	She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures.
1211	She was started on Depakote for this.
1212	Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures.
1213	EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.
1214	In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope.
1215	Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.
1216	Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.
1217	When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.
1218	These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.
1219	Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.
1220	She does not recall the events herself.
1221	The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).
1222	The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.
1223	In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.
1224	She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management.
1225	The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.
1226	Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.
1227	The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.
1228	She denies fevers/chills.
1229	No chest pain, palpitations.
1230	Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.
1231	Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.
1232	She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.

1400	EKG: Sinus at 86.
1401	Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.
1402	CXR 7/28: NAD
1403	Chest CT 4/03: 
1404	IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
1405	     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
1406	     apex.
1407	Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
1408	     tiny lung nodules seen.
1409	MRI 9/02
1410	     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
1411	     ischemia.
1412	There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
1413	     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
1414	     hole or craniotomy.
1415	There are chronic appearing, small right
1416	     cerebellar infarcts.
1417	There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
1418	     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
1419	     with small vessel ischemic change.
1420	There is FLAIR hyperintensity
1421	     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
1422	     parietal and left occipital lobes.
1423	No abnormal enhancement is
1424	     seen.
1425	The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
1426	     unremarkable.
1427	The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
1428	There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
1429	There is
1430	     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
1431	There are
1432	     bilateral lens implants.
1433	The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
1434	     otherwise unremarkable.
1435	MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
1436	     posterior cerbral artery.
1437	There is diffuse irregularity of the
1438	     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.
1439	There is moderate
1440	     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
1441	The
1442	     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.
1443	     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
1444	     the circle of Willis.
1445	Impression:
1446	     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
1447	     predominance as described.
1448	This could represent hemorrhage, high
1449	     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
1450	     injection.
1451	Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
1452	     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.
1453	Diffuse irregularity
1454	     of the left posterior cerebral artery.
1455	These findings could be
1456	     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
1457	     vasculitis is another possibility.
1458	Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
1459	No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
1460	Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
1461	Small vessel ischemic changes.
1462	Carotid US 3/02
1463	IMPRESSIONS:
1464	RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.
1465	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
1466	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
1467	BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.
1468	Echo    01
1469	Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
1470	    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.
1471	Left ventricular
1472	    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.
1473	There is no flattening of the
1474	    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
1475	    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
1476	    arterial pressure.
1477	There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
1478	    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
1479	There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
1480	    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
1481	There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
1482	    represent atherosclerotic change.
1483	The aortic valve is trileaflet.
1484	Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
1485	    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
1486	    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
1487	    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.
1488	There is no evident aortic stenosis
1489	    or aortic insufficiency.
1490	Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.
1491	Otherwise,
1492	    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.
1493	Normal appearing tricuspid
1494	    and pulmonary leaflets.
1495	There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
1496	    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
1497	Flow velocity could not be optimally
1498	    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
1499	    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
1500	There is no evident pericardial effusion.
1501	ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
1502	1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.
1503	History from family sounds much more like seizure.
1504	Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.
1505	Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.
1506	Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.

1528	RE:  Jennifer Vance
1529	     MR #542-66-00-3
1530	Dear Vester:
1531	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
1532	evaluation.
1533	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
1534	briefly for our records.
1535	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
1536	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
1537	significant coronary artery disease.
1538	In 2061, after a four to five
1539	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
1540	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
1541	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
1542	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
1543	inadequate results.
1544	She therefore was taken electively for
1545	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
1546	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
1547	She subsequently continued to
1548	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
1549	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
1550	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
1551	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
1552	The catheterization
1553	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
1554	artery graft.
1555	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
1556	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
1557	She recently has undergone an
1558	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
1559	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
1560	Trials
1561	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
1562	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
1563	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
1564	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
1565	She had no
1566	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
1567	Over the past two weeks
1568	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
1569	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
1570	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
1571	The pain is not
1572	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
1573	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
1574	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a
1575	cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.
1576	Vance, Jennifer
1577	MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069
1578	Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin
1579	dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's
1580	contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.
1581	Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,
1582	NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.
1583	Allergies:  None.
1584	Cigarettes - none.
1585	Ethanol - social.
1586	Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,
1587	mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one
1588	brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother
1589	dying from melanoma age 36.
1590	The rest of her siblings and children
1591	have not heart disease.
1592	Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.
1593	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,
1594	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.
1595	The neck is
1596	supple.
1597	JVP flat.
1598	Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
1599	greater than left bruits.
1600	Chest is clear.
1601	Cardiac exam shows a
1602	normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection
1603	murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant
1604	diastolic murmur.
1605	The abdomen is benign.
1606	Extremities reveal no
1607	appreciable edema.
1608	Peripheral pulses are intact.
1609	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
1610	PR interval
1611	of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.
1612	There are minor
1613	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
1614	Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
1615	variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and
1616	dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
1617	She has had a
1618	retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
1619	most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
1620	significant provokable ischemia.
1621	Nonetheless, I am concerned that
1622	her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
1623	I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
1624	I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
1625	studies.
1626	In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
1627	dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive
1628	antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
1629	Unless her variegata porphyria
1630	precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po
1631	q.d.
1632	I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
1633	In
1634	addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d.
1635	and
1636	I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
1637	porphyria does not 
1638	MR #542-66-00-3                    -3-            July 18, 2069
1639	preclude this.
1640	She understands that if she has evidence for
1641	significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
1642	to undergo repeat coronary angiography.
1643	Thank you very much for

1667	Dear Hicks,
1668	I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
1669	She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.
1670	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
1671	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
1672	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
1673	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
1674	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
1675	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
1676	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
1677	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
1678	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
1679	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
1680	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
1681	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
1682	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
1683	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
1684	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
1685	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
1686	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
1687	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
1688	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
1689	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
1690	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
1691	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
1692	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
1693	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
1694	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
1695	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
1696	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
1697	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
1698	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
1699	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
1700	Her abdomen is benign.
1701	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
1702	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
1703	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
1704	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
1705	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
1706	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
1707	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
1708	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
1709	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
1710	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
1711	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
1712	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
1713	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
1714	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
1715	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
1716	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
1717	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
1718	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
1719	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
1720	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
1721	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
1722	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
1723	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
1724	Sincerely,

1815	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1816	52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.
1817	On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.
1818	In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.
1819	The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.
1820	- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin
1821	- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan
1822	- NPO from midnight, pepcid
1823	- check chem7, CBC, coags
1824	- has an insulin pump
1825	- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

2189	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
2190	78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.
2191	Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.
2192	Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.
2193	ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis
2194	Most likely secondary to cellulitis vs wound infection
2195	Blood cultures, urine cultures, wound cultures, and respiratory cultures
2196	Panculture if SPIKES
2197	f/u microbiology c and s
2198	start broad spectrum antibiotics: Vancomycin 1 g q12 IV for presumed MRSA and Unasyn 3000 mg IV q6 for presumed gram negatives (with minimal anaerobe coverage)
2199	if clinically decompensates, will consider Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage and Flagyl for anaerobe coverage
2200	ISSUE #2: Diabetes Mellitus
2201	continue with home regimen of metformin 1000 bid and lantus 14 SC
2202	insulin sliding scale for coverage
