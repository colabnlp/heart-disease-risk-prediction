1107	1	a	CXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.

1109	1	a	No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.
1110	1	a	However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion.
1111	1	a	No evidence for deep venous thrombosis.
1112	1	a	Small right pleural effusion.
1113	1	a	Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.
1114	1	a	EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.
1115	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea.
1116	1	a	The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF.
1117	1	a	The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear.
1118	1	a	More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI.
1119	1	a	Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT.
1120	1	a	Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion.
1121	1	a	Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
1122	1	a	If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
1123	1	a	Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles.
1124	1	a	Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.
1125	1	a	Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.
