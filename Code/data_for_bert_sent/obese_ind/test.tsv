85	History of Present Illness
86	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
87	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
88	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
89	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
90	No variation with food.
91	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
92	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
93	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
94	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).
95	ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail.
96	He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

138	No focal rhonchi.
139	No pleural rub.
140	+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth.
141	No sternal movement wiht palpation.
142	No palpable sternal wire.

144	RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub.

148	+ bowel sounds.
149	Extremity
150	Warm.
151	No edema.
152	Lab Test
153	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
154	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
155	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
156	Impression
157	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
158	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
159	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
160	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
161	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
162	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
163	Plan
164	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
165	- check CXR
166	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
167	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
168	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
169	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

179	Dear Dr. Swanson:
180	I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.
181	He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.
182	He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.
183	Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.
184	He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.
185	He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.
186	His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.
187	Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.
188	He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
189	We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.
190	He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.
191	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
192	Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

579	MR# 471-90-84-7
580	November 24, 2071
581	This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 
582	for management of papillary thyroid cancer.
583	Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 
584	when she felt a prominence in her neck.
585	She did not experience any dysphagia 
586	or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 
587	examination.
588	She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 
589	hospital.
590	The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 
591	cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
592	She was 
593	subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 
594	thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.
595	The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 
596	was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 
597	reimplanted.
598	According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 
599	locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.
600	The 
601	pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 
602	lymphovascular invasion.
603	There was an additional focus of papillary 
604	carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.
605	Of 
606	note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.
607	The tumor 
608	did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
609	Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.
610	She has been 
611	maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.
612	She says that she feels generally 
613	well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.
614	She denies any 
615	changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.
616	She does endorse a one pound 
617	weight gain over the last two months.
618	She denies any paresthesias or other 
619	symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.
620	She denies any history of thyroid 
621	disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.
622	She is now referred for 
623	consideration of radioiodine ablation.
624	Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.
625	She has an 
626	ejection fraction of 25%.
627	She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 
628	hypertension, and anxiety.
629	No history of childhood irradiation.
630	Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 
631	mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 
632	captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.
633	Allergies:No known drug allergies.
634	Social History:Remote history of tobacco.
635	She quit 4 years ago.
636	She 
637	endorses rare alcohol use.
638	She is married with four children.
639	Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.
640	Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.
641	Weight 208.
642	Pulse 
643	88.
644	In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 
645	NAD.
646	HEENT:  PERRLA.
647	EOMI.
648	No proptosis or lid lag.
649	Neck: supple with a 
650	large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.
651	No 
652	Page 2
653	remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
654	Lungs: clear to 
655	auscultation bilaterally.
656	Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 
657	rhythm.
658	Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.
659	Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.
660	Neurologic: reflexes are 
661	slightly delayed.
662	There is no tremor of outstretched hands.
663	Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 
664	prior to surgery.
665	Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.
666	Calcium prior to 
667	surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 
668	surgery were in the mid-8 range.
669	Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 
670	failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.
671	Ms. 
672	Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 
673	older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 
674	multifocal disease.
675	Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.
676	We suspect that 
677	she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.
678	I have recommended 
679	131I treatment.
680	Benefits and risks were discussed.
681	In addition, I think she 
682	would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.
683	TSH and calcium were drawn today.
684	We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

840	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.
841	Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.
842	TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).
843	DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).
844	The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.
845	Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.
846	She is currently CP free.
847	1.
848	Chest pain
849	-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now
850	-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.
851	Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
852	-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult
853	-     TTE in AM
854	-     Check amylase, lipase 
855	-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM
856	-     Smoking cessation consult

983	Dear Dr. Barron:
984	Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
985	I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
986	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
987	Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
988	It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
989	On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
990	She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
991	I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
992	Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
993	Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
994	Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.
995	She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
996	Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
997	She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
998	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.
999	Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.
1000	She has no known drug allergies.
1001	Social History:  She is married and has three children.
1002	She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
1003	Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
1004	She has never used tobacco.
1005	Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
1006	There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
1007	Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
1008	Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
1009	All others are negative.
1010	On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
1011	Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
1012	Her weight is 213 pounds.
1013	Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
1014	There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
1015	The carotid upstrokes are full.
1016	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
1017	The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
1018	The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
1019	The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.
1020	Her extremities show no edema.
1021	Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
1022	She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
1023	I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
1024	On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.
1025	She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
1026	She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
1027	There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
1028	She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
1029	In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
1030	She did receive drug-eluting stents.
1031	The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
1032	What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
1033	From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
1034	She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
1035	I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
1036	To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
1037	We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
1038	In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
1039	The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
1040	In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.
1041	Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
1042	After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
1043	However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
1044	She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.
1045	The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.
1046	This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
1047	I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
1048	Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
1049	If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

1105	crepitus, but no warmth or swelling.
1106	There is some pain at extremes of 
1107	flexion on the left of 110 degrees.
1108	Ankles and toes within normal 
1109	limits.
1110	Please note above in the clinical history that she does not 
1111	complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because 
1112	of the knee pain.
1113	The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to 
1114	the fact that the large blood pressure 
1115	cuff did not fit around her right arm.

1382	RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
1383	CDH#810 86 43 7
1384	Dear Dr. Shirley:
1385	Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.
1386	Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.
1387	Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
1388	underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
1389	hysterectomy in early October of 2078.
1390	Her post-operative course was 
1391	complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
1392	October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
1393	which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
1394	The episode was accompanied by 
1395	some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
1396	any palpitations.
1397	She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
1398	any symptomatic recurrences.
1399	Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
1400	she has been recovering well.
1401	She has no prior cardiac history.
1402	She 
1403	specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient 
1404	neurologic symptoms.
1405	She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
1406	mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.
1407	She feels that her exertional 
1408	capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
1409	stopped smoking.
1410	She does not have a known history of hypertension, however 
1411	VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
1412	systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
1413	with verapamil.
1414	There is no prior history of syncope.
1415	Page Two
1416	Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.
1417	has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.
1418	She previously smoked 
1419	two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
1420	any particular change in her health precipitating this.
1421	She rarely drinks 
1422	ethanol.
1423	She has not had any prior surgeries.
1424	Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.
1425	Review of 
1426	systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
1427	admission.
1428	Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
1429	comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.
1430	HEENT 
1431	is externally unremarkable.
1432	There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.
1433	Carotids 
1434	are palpable bilaterally.
1435	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
1436	Cardiac exam 
1437	reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
1438	impulse.
1439	There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
1440	Abdomen 
1441	is soft and nontender.
1442	There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
1443	abdomen.
1444	Extremities are without edema.
1445	Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
1446	palpable.
1447	The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
1448	of .18, QRS .08.
1449	There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
1450	and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.
1451	An 
1452	echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although 
1453	with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
1454	My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
1455	the perioperative period.
1456	She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
1457	not been previously treated.
1458	This would explain her electrocardiographic 
1459	changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
1460	atrial fibrillation.
1461	I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
1462	mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.
1463	Once her incision is further healed we will 
1464	arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
1465	regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
1466	mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.
1467	Page Three
1468	will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
1469	tolerance test.
1470	We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
1471	report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.
1472	We also gave her a 
1473	prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
1474	medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
1475	which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
1476	Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
1477	Sincerely,
1478	Paul N. Shelton, M.D.

1484	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
1485	Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.
1486	The Chief Complaint, History 
1487	of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
1488	Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
1489	by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
1490	the patient.
1491	Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
1492	with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
1493	essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.
1494	She 
1495	has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
1496	and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.
1497	Her 
1498	symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta.
1499	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
1500	noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
1501	systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
1502	border).
1503	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
1504	changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.
1505	These were 
1506	previously noted in 10/78.
1507	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
1508	and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
1509	morphine to relieve her pain.
1510	She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
1511	and was given some GI meds.
1512	She eventually became pain-free, 
1513	although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest.
1514	There are no electrocardiographic changes.
1515	IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
1516	pain suspicious for unstable angina.
1517	She has responded well to 
1518	aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
1519	evaluation.
1520	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.
1521	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission.
1522	Condition satisfactory.

1853	Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.
1854	HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago.
1855	I had treated him with:
1856	GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID
1857	METFORMIN  500MG PO TID
1858	LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD
1859	DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD
1860	HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD
1861	however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:
1862	DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 
1863	HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 
1864	When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month.
1865	He feels well.
1866	He says he's lost 10 lbs.
1867	since his last visit (262 lbs.
1868	on 2/26 - 263 lbs.
1869	today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.

1886	Cardiac: RRR, rate   68 , no extra sounds
1887	Resp.
1888	: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds
1889	Plan:
1890	1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day.
1891	For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.
1892	2. also poor BP control for a diabetic.
1893	Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD.
1894	It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.
1895	3.
1896	MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.
1897	4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

1908	Dear Dr. Truong:
1909	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
1910	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
1911	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
1912	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
1913	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
1914	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
1915	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
1916	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
1917	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
1918	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
1919	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
1920	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
1921	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
1922	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
1923	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
1924	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
1925	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
1926	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
1927	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
1928	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.

1937	PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
1938	History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
1939	seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.
1940	On the last visit he was having 
1941	chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
1942	evaluation.
1943	At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
1944	ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.
1945	The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
1946	the past with a decreased LV function.
1947	However repeat echo within the 
1948	past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
1949	of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
1950	Humbert Hospital against medical advice.
1951	After being evaluated in the 
1952	Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
1953	the Internal Medicine clinic.
1954	Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
1955	Carafate 1 gm.
1956	PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
1957	q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d.
1958	p.r.n.
1959	and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.
1960	His 
1961	insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m.
1962	and 18 units q.p.m.
1963	and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.
1964	On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
1965	pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
1966	discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
1967	Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
1968	of 76.
1969	He is not in any acute distress.
1970	His chest is clear to 
1971	auscultation.
1972	His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
1973	sounds.
1974	His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.
1975	rectal exam is guaiac negative.
1976	His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
1977	pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.
1978	Assessment and Plan:  
1979	1.
1980	Cardiac.
1981	The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
1982	     to rule out ischemia.
1983	2.
1984	Hypertension.
1985	His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
1986	3.
1987	Diabetes.
1988	His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
1989	     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
1990	4.
1991	The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
1992	     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
1993	5.
1994	General.
1995	The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
1996	     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

2009	Dear Dr. Dill:
2010	DOB:  10/11/2082
2011	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
2012	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
2013	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
2014	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
2015	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
2016	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
2017	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
2018	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
2019	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
2020	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
2021	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
2022	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
2023	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
2024	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
2025	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
2026	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
2027	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
2028	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
2029	His weight has been stable.
2030	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
2031	His weight has remained stable.
2032	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
2033	Past Medical History:
2034	1.
2035	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
2036	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
2037	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
2038	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
2039	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
2040	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
2041	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
2042	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
2043	2.
2044	Hypertension.
2045	3.
2046	Dyslipidemia.
2047	4.
2048	Diabetes.
2049	5.
2050	Obstructive sleep apnea.
2051	6.
2052	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
2053	7.
2054	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
2055	8.?
2056	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
2057	9.
2058	Atrial fibrillation.
2059	10.
2060	Obesity.
2061	He has no known drug allergies.
2062	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
2063	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
2064	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
2065	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
2066	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
2067	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
2068	His father lived until the age of 88.
2069	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
2070	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
2071	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
2072	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
2073	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
2074	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
2075	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
2076	There is no wheezing.
2077	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
2078	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
2079	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
2080	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
2081	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
2082	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
2083	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
2084	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
2085	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
2086	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
2087	He appears to be functional class III.
2088	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
2089	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
2090	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
2091	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
2092	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
2093	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
2094	We will leave this decision to them.
2095	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
2096	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
2097	We will be in touch following the procedure.
2098	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
2099	Sincerely,

2198	"	Interval History:"
2199	   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
2200	Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
2201	Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
2202	Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
2203	The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
2204	A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
2205	There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
2206	A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
2207	Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
2208	RV function was normal.
2209	He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
2210	He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
2211	He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted.
2212	He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
2213	The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
2214	LV EF 63%.
2215	He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
2216	His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.
2217	A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
2218	The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
2219	LV EF 68%.
2220	He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
2221	He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
2222	He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.
2223	He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
2224	His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
2225	Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
2226	This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
2227	Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
2228	He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e.
2229	muscolskeletal in nature).
2230	He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
2231	He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
2232	He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
2233	No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
2234	He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
2235	He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
2236	He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
2237	Past medical history:
2238	   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
2239	Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
2240	2) Hypertension
2241	3) Hyperlipideimia
2242	4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI
2243	5) Ankylosing spondylitis

2265	   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.
2266	Assessment and plan:
2267	   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
2268	1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.
2269	Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
2270	Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
2271	He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
2272	His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
2273	The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
2274	He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
2275	His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
2276	However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
2277	I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
2278	2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.
2279	His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
2280	Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.
2281	He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
2282	flushing).
2283	He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
2284	After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.
2285	He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
2286	He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
2287	3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
2288	He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

2303	Chandler, Jessica
2304	MRN #748-80-38-0
2305	May 05, 2069
2306	Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
2307	artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
2308	Since the surgery she has done
2309	quite well.
2310	She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
2311	4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
2312	and also education on dietary modification.
2313	During her hospital
2314	course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
2315	ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
2316	wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
2317	She was
2318	started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
2319	She
2320	also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
2321	Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
2322	She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
2323	renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
2324	Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
2325	diuretics.
2326	Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
2327	with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
2328	She is
2329	not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
2330	of breath.
2331	She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
2332	Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
2333	Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
2334	Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
2335	q.d.,
2336	lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o.
2337	daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o.
2338	Kayexalate 15 p.o.
2339	q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
2340	q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o.
2341	q. day, Nephrocaps
2342	one tablet p.o.
2343	q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
2344	subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o.
2345	q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o.
2346	q. day and
2347	CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
2348	Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
2349	pounds.
2350	Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
2351	150/100, pulse is 80.
2352	Her skin is without any rashes or
2353	ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.
2354	Heart regular rhythm,
2355	distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
2356	Her lungs are clear,
2357	there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
2358	healed.
2359	Her extremities are without any edema.
2360	Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
2361	Diagnosis:
2362	1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
2363	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
2364	Page 2 
2365	3)   Diabetes mellitus.
2366	4)   Anemia of chronic disease.
2367	5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.
2368	6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
2369	7)   Hypertension.
2370	8)   Morbid obesity.
2371	Plan:
2372	1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
2373	She is clinically
2374	     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
2375	     or angina.
2376	Her ejection fraction significantly improved
2377	     postoperatively.
2378	I am concerned about a relatively high blood
2379	     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
2380	     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
2381	I will
2382	     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
2383	     of her potassium.
2384	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
2385	Again we'll check regular labs
2386	     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
2387	Stable.
2388	Her blood pressure have been
2389	     under fairly good control.
2390	She has also lost a significant
2391	     amount of weight over 20 pounds.
2392	Her current weight is 326
2393	     pounds.
2394	We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
2395	We'll also recheck her blood count
2396	     and follow-up.
2397	The patient is using her CPAP
2398	     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
2399	6)   Hyperkalemia.
2400	She will continue with the Kayexalate as
2401	     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
2402	     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
2403	7)   Morbid obesity.
2404	She is making good progress with her weight
2405	     loss.
2406	She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
2407	     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
2408	     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
2409	     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica
2410	Page 3 
2411	She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

2426	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
2427	evaluated by Dr. Wooten.
2428	Please see Dr. Wooten's note.
2429	The 
2430	patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
2431	days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
2432	sputum.
2433	She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting.
2434	Minimal diaphoresis.
2435	She has had a fever.
2436	No urinary symptoms.
2437	She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes.
2438	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
2439	bypass grafting.
2440	MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
2441	albuterol and Nephrocaps.
2442	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

2447	Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales.
2448	abdomen is obese, soft.
2449	Neurologic exam is non-focal.
2450	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory 
2451	effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.
2452	EKG 
2453	is unchanged.
2454	Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time.
2455	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated.

2460	some attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the 
2461	infraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein 
2462	without success.
2463	The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and 
2464	the neck anatomy is difficult to assess.
2465	We are unable to 
2466	establish a line.
2467	She has a chest x-ray for rule out of 
2468	pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for 
2469	blood draws.

2489	07/28/70
2490	Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
2491	shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.
2492	I had added
2493	Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.
2494	However,
2495	her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
2496	increase in her BUN and creatinine.
2497	Her BUN is in the 80's, and
2498	her creatinine is about 3.4.
2499	She states her breathing has been
2500	excellent, however.
2501	She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
2502	exertion.
2503	She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
2504	having any kind of dry cough.
2505	Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
2506	q.day, Paxil 20 p.o.
2507	q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o.
2508	q.day, Prilosec 20 mg

2514	q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
2515	in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
2516	q.day.
2517	Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
2518	Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
2519	acute distress.
2520	Her weight is 330 pounds.
2521	This is down over 20
2522	pounds over the past month.
2523	Her blood pressure is 122/80.
2524	Her
2525	pulse is 80.
2526	Her lungs are clear.
2527	Her heart reveals distant heart
2528	sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.
2529	Her extremities are notable
2530	for the absence of lower extremity edema.
2531	Her abdomen is also
2532	noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
2533	past.
2534	Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
2535	continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
2536	the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.
2537	There is beefy red
2538	granulation tissue surrounding this.

2557	Plan:
2558	She is doing much better on
2559	higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
2560	since her last visit here about a month ago.
2561	At this point in
2562	time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
2563	given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
2564	to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
2565	and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
2566	and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
2567	telephone conversation in four days.
2568	Should she have an increase
2569	in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
2570	Stable
2571	without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.
2572	Continue current
2573	medication.
2574	She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.
2575	I strongly wanted her to go
2576	on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
2577	her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.
2578	She is
2579	planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.
2580	I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
2581	strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.
2582	Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.

2585	The plan as above is to
2586	stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days.

2588	I also gave her a duoderm dressing
2589	to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her

2591	appropriate treatment.

2604	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 57 year old 
2605	gentleman with history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and 
2606	angina in the past, comes in today with increasing use of 
2607	nitroglycerins and chest pain, light headedness and diaphoresis 
2608	after exerting himself this afternoon.
2609	He took two of the 
2610	sublingual nitros with gradual improvement and gradually became 
2611	chest pain free.
2612	EMS gave him aspirin.
2613	Of note, he has had two 
2614	episodes of chest pain over the last few day.
2615	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for shortness of breath or chest pain 
2616	currently.
2617	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Myocardial infarction in 2063, and 
2618	apparently had PTCA and cath.

2638	troponin 0.02, this could be on the rise.
2639	His electrocardiogram 
2640	was 85, with Q waves in 3 and F, and T wave inversions in 2 and F, 
2641	as well as flattening in V4 through V6.
2642	Chest x-ray showed no 
2643	congestive heart failure but an elevated right hemidiaphragm.
2644	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the emergency room he is treated 
2645	with a full dose of aspirin even though he was chest pain free on 
2646	arrival.

2973	When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
2974	Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
2975	Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
2976	Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
2977	Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.
2978	so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
2979	We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
2980	"He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
2981	OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.
2982	Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.
2983	DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.
2984	Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.
2985	UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.
2986	Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.
2987	Optho and podiatry current.
2988	Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.
2989	Coronary artery disease : s/p CABG 5/25, satable on ASA/Statin/ACEI/BB
2990	Hypertension 
2991	Vital Signs
2992	BP 118/70, Wt 235 lb
2993	well controlled.
2994	Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.
2995	Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.
2996	Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.
2997	Insomnia : since service.
2998	NTI helped a little in past, not after a while.
2999	CBT might help if successful.
3000	Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.
3001	Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.
3002	Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

3009	"			Reason for visit:"
3010	   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
3011	Interval History:
3012	   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
3013	A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
3014	An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
3015	The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion.
3016	HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA.
3017	1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
3018	His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.
3019	An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
3020	Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
3021	He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
3022	(BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2.
3023	An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
3024	Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters.
3025	He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
3026	In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief.
3027	He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
3028	An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
3029	He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done.
3030	It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.
3031	Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held.
3032	He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
3033	He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
3034	Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.
3035	(2 liters NP)
3036	Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent.
3037	Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

3473	   Since last seen, Ursula notes that her weight continues to rise, and with this, her angina is clearly worse.
3474	She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.
3475	Medications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage

3480	There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted.
3481	There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits.
3482	Her abdomen is morbidly obese.
3483	Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema.
3484	EKG:  NSR with an old IPMI.

3551	Nathan J Fernandes M.D.
3552	College Station, NC 22169
3553	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
3554	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
3555	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
3556	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
3557	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
3558	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
3559	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
3560	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
3561	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
3562	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
3563	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
3564	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
3565	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
3566	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.
3567	Past medical history:
3568	   Hypertension.
3569	Hyperlipidemia.
3570	CAD.
3571	PAD.
3572	Prior tobacco use.

3578	Prostatitis.
3579	Hemorrhoids.
3580	Colonic polyps.
3581	Chronic normocytic anemia.

3584	Atacand  15 mg qd
3585	doxepin

3593	-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress
3594	-Heent:   Benign
3595	-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits
3596	-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs
3597	-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
3598	S1 and S2.
3599	There is no murmur, rub, or gallop
3600	-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.
3601	There are no masses or bruits appreciated
3602	-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.
3603	Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.
3604	Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration
3605	-BP: 145/80    on the right
3606	"	Other Data:"
3607	   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.
3608	Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.
3609	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
3610	Assessment and plan:
3611	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
3612	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
3613	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
3614	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
3615	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
3616	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
3617	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
3618	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
3619	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
3620	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
3621	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
3622	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
3623	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
3624	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
3625	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
3626	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

3762	RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.
3763	Dear Dr. Cooper:
3764	  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes.
3765	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
3766	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
3767	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
3768	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
3769	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
3770	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
3771	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
3772	He returns today for review.
3773	He remains in reasonable health.
3774	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
3775	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
3776	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
3777	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
3778	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.
3779	Past medical history:
3780	   CAD 
3781	-- 2082 CABG x 3 
3782	-- 10/9/91 LIMA to LAD patent; mod LAD stenosis beyond graft; SVT to OM patent; SVG to RCA occl @ origin

3841	Impression:
3842	   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication.
3843	He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia.
3844	Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.
3845	Assessment and plan:
3846	   1.
3847	CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.
3848	2.
3849	PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.

3881	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.
3882	Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG.
3883	He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors.
3884	but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.

3994	      Assessment and plan:
3995	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
3996	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
3997	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
3998	Problems:
3999	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
4000	Takes it about once/month.
4001	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
4002	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
4003	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
4004	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
4005	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
4006	Continue her present dose of statin.
4007	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
4008	Continue her current regimen.

4031	History of Present Illness
4032	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
4033	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
4034	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
4035	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
4036	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
4037	He presents now for cath and surgery.

4143	60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.
4144	It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.
4145	He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.
4146	He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.
4147	In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.
4148	Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.
4149	He was discharged without clear follow-up.
4150	The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.
4151	He has been ambulating on the wound.
4152	He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.
4153	He reports no pain.
4154	Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.

4364	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
4365	Assessment/Plan
4366	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
4367	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
4368	S/P Rt TMA.
4369	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
4370	By issue:
4371	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
4372	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
4373	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
4374	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
4375	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
4376	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
4377	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
4378	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
4379	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
4380	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
4381	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
4382	Might hold ranitidine as well.
4383	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
4384	Currently on olanzapine.
4385	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
4386	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
4387	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
4388	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
4389	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
4390	Would seek ID input to the end.
4391	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
4392	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
4393	Recs per nephrology
4394	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
4395	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
4396	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
4397	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
4398	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
4399	Thanks,

4611	Dear Dr. Huerta:
4612	Reason for visit:
4613	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
4614	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
4615	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
4616	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
4617	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
4618	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
4619	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
4620	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
4621	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
4622	The patient has been managed medically since then.
4623	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
4624	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
4625	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
4626	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
4627	His weight has been up and down.
4628	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
4629	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
4630	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
4631	Past medical history:
4632	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
4633	Current Medications:
4634	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
4635	 Glucophage 1 g BID
4636	 glyburide 10 mg BID
4637	 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM
4638	 Lopid 600 mg BID
4639	 allopurinol 300 mg QD
4640	 omeprazole 20 mg QD
4641	 aspirin 81 mg QD
4642	 Pravachol 80 mg QD
4643	 Avandia 8 mg QD
4644	Allergies:
4645	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
4646	Family history:
4647	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
4648	Social history:
4649	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
4650	Review of systems:
4651	   As above, otherwise negative.
4652	Physical examination:
4653	-Pulse:   60
4654	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
4655	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
4656	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
4657	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
4658	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
4659	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
4660	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
4661	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
4662	Selected recent labs:
4663	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
4664	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
4665	Assessment and plan:
4666	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
4667	He is doing well.
4668	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
4669	He is currently not anticoagulated.
4670	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
4671	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
4672	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
4673	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
4674	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
4675	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
4676	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
4677	Changes to Medications this visit
4678	lisinopril 20 mg   QD

4830	MRN:      3299811 
4831	INITIAL VISIT 
4832	This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit.
4833	The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
4834	recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
4835	syndrome and back/chest pain.
4836	Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
4837	She was found to have a blood
4838	pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
4839	headaches.
4840	She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
4841	found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
4842	She was transferred to the
4843	Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic
4844	convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
4845	She also suffered a urinary tract
4846	infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.
4847	She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,
4848	at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
4849	On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of
4850	127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.
4851	She had a myxedematous face and
4852	was obese.
4853	She was cardiovascularly stable.
4854	Neurologically, she was able to move
4855	all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
4856	Cranial nerves
4857	intact.
4858	Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to
4859	elevated blood pressure.
4860	Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
4861	Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar
4862	puncture, both of which were negative.
4863	Electroencephalogram was  performed and
4864	showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
4865	The patient's
4866	alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
4867	She had
4868	an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral
4869	leads.
4870	Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
4871	The patient underwent a course of
4872	physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
4873	A
4874	specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
4875	this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
4876	use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
4877	threshold for seizure activity.
4878	Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.
4879	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,
4880	panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone
4881	tumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.

4953	Location: Suite 53-02Q
4954	"Date of Admission:  December 15, 2091	"
4955	"PCP:	Isaac Ng "
4956	"ID/CC:	Change in mental status"
4957	HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days.
4958	Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission.
4959	As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days.
4960	They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused.
4961	The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day.
4962	On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night.
4963	She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.
4964	The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.
4965	The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.
4966	She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.
4967	ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB.
4968	Blood Pressure: Treated with labetalol 10 mg IV x 1, Hydral 10 mg IV x 1, decreased to 176/74.
4969	Hyponatremia: NS x 1 L
4970	PMH:
4971	Pituitary adenoma  2080 s/p resection, XRT
4972	Diabetes mellitus Type II - On Humulin 15/15 
4973	Hypertension - on Avapro, allergy to Ace-I
4974	Angina pectoris - negative stress 
4975	Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH.
4976	Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.

5276	NICU day: 1
5277	Critically ill secondary to: 
5278	R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration
5279	Critical Care Min: 35 min
5280	History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness.
5281	BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived.
5282	Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.
5283	Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
5284	and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.
5285	She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.
5286	CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
5287	She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.
5288	At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.
5289	She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.

5320	Neuro Exam: Off sedation &#8211; no verbal response to noxious stimuli, intermittently extensor postures; minimally reactive small pupils, midline gaze in primary position, able to x-midline, no BTT, + R. corneal brisk vs. L., grimace to nasal tickle better on the L. than on the R., R. UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l
5321	Imaging/Studies/TCD: 
5322	Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.
5323	CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
5324	Assessment: 
5325	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
5326	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
5327	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.
5328	Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

5787	I saw this patient with Dr. Sawyer.
5788	I confirm that I have
5789	interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's
5790	documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the
5791	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
5792	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Heart is racing.
5793	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female
5794	with history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and sarcoid, who
5795	presents with onset one hour prior to admission of left arm
5796	pressure and heart racing.
5797	The patient denies shortness of
5798	breath.
5799	She has no nausea, vomiting, and no fevers or chills.
5800	She says that she has occasionally had these symptoms in the
5801	past, they have already stopped on their own.
5802	Tonight, they
5803	lasted for approximately 30 minutes prior to calling EMS.
5804	En
5805	route EMS took 12-lead ECG showing a rate of 150, suspected a
5806	flutter and was given 20 mg diltiazem by EMS with no response.
5807	She describes feeling in her left arm as dull pain, it is 3/10,
5808	and it has not made better or worse by anything.
5809	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.
5810	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.
5811	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see paper chart.
5812	MEDICATIONS:  Please see paper chart.
5813	ALLERGIES:  Please see paper chart.
5814	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.
5815	FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.
5816	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged African-American woman,
5817	awake, alert, and in mild distress.
5818	Exam limited by obesity.
5819	Exam is significant for neck; normal to inspection, supple,
5820	nontender, and unable to appreciate JVP.
5821	Respiratory:  No
5822	distress.
5823	Chest:  Nontender and normal breath sounds.
5824	Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic at 115 and regular and 2/6 systolic
5825	ejection murmur, no gallop, and no friction rub.
5826	Abdomen:  Soft,
5827	nontender, no organomegaly, and no masses, otherwise, as
5828	documented on the paper chart.
5829	IMAGING STUDIES:  ECG shows a flutter at 150 beats per minute in
5830	ECG #1.
5831	ECG final shows a sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats
5832	per minute with no signs of ischemia.
5833	IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history
5834	of occasional brief palpitations now with one hour of continuous
5835	palpitations and ECG consistent with atrial flutter.
5836	She was
5837	given 20 mg of diltiazem IV by EMS.
5838	In the Emergency Department,
5839	she was given 20 mg without significant response, followed by 40
5840	mg ID and was achieved a good response.
5841	As the patient required
5842	a significant amount of diltiazem to slow her rate and convert
5843	her and she is also feeling somewhat nervous, we will keep her in
5844	the Observation Unit overnight.
5845	She should get an oral dose of
5846	diltiazem overnight.
5847	She should get cardiac monitoring in the
5848	morning.
5849	PLAN:  To discuss with KEKELA Cardiology and obtain consultation as
5850	to possible discharge on beta-blockers versus calcium channel
5851	blockers.
5852	If the patient does not have a new symptoms she would
5853	be stable for discharge in the morning.
5854	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular
5855	response.
5856	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left arm pain.
5857	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  35 minutes.

5869	HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
5870	44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.
5871	She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated 
5872	creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
5873	evaluation.
5874	The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as 
5875	planned.
5876	"She states that she has been ""too busy."""
5877	Her only complaint 
5878	today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
5879	relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.
5880	Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.
5881	A noted in her 
5882	ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d.
5883	drug, however, 
5884	Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
5885	on an almost p.r.n.
5886	basis.
5887	Review of systems is essentially normal.
5888	Specifically, she denies any 
5889	headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.
5890	She also denies any 
5891	symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.
5892	She has no history of 
5893	dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
5894	Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.
5895	Vital signs are 
5896	significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.
5897	HEENT exam is unremarkable.
5898	Lungs are clear.
5899	Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
5900	S1, S2.
5901	No S3 is appreciated.
5902	There are no murmurs or rubs.
5903	Abdomen is 
5904	slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.
5905	No masses are 
5906	appreciated.
5907	Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
5908	suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.
5909	Indeed, exam of 
5910	her legs is entirely unremarkable.
5911	Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
5912	sediment and a urine creatinine.
5913	Assessment and Plan:
5914	1.
5915	Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
5916	     on her Procardia.
5917	I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
5918	     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
5919	     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.
5920	I will see her in a few days in order 
5921	     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
5922	     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
5923	2.
5924	Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
5925	     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
5926	     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)
5927	I  have asked her to continue taking 
5928	     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
5929	     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.
5930	Page 2                                        29195561
5931	3.
5932	Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
5933	     appointment.
5934	In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
5935	     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.
5936	She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
5937	     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.
5938	Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
5939	     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
5940	     function.
5941	4.
5942	Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
5943	"     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long."""
5944	She is to see me 
5945	     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.
5946	Her 
5947	     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
5948	     will not be repeated until next year.

6523	Reason for Visit
6524	Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.
6525	We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.
6526	He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.
6527	He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.
6528	Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.
6529	He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.
6530	His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.
6531	I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.
6532	He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.
6533	He is worried about his remaining vision.
6534	He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.
6535	She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.
6536	He also is having trouble sleeping.
6537	He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.
6538	He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.
6539	He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

6601	DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
6602	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
6603	The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
6604	In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
6605	There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
6606	This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.
6607	The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
6608	She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.
6609	The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
6610	She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
6611	The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
6612	Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
6613	Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.
6614	There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
6615	On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.
6616	MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
6617	The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
6618	MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
6619	Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
6620	Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
6621	It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
6622	Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
6623	Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
6624	There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
6625	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
6626	The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
6627	There are no medication allergies reported.
6628	PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.
6629	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.
6630	Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.
6631	She uses alcohol occasionally.
6632	She has a 12th grade education.
6633	She lives alone and is a widow.
6634	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.
6635	The patient is overweight.
6636	Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
6637	Weight is 217 pounds.
6638	Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.
6639	Poor neck posture is noted.
6640	Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
6641	Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.
6642	Temporal arteries are normal.
6643	Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
6644	Romberg is negative.
6645	Tandem gait is normal.
6646	The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
6647	There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
6648	This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
6649	There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
6650	NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.
6651	Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.
6652	Extraocular movements are full.
6653	Visual fields are intact.
6654	There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.
6655	Hearing is intact.
6656	Oropharynx is normal.
6657	Palate elevates well.
6658	Tongue is midline.
6659	Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
6660	Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
6661	There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
6662	Coordination testing today seemed intact.
6663	Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
6664	Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.
6665	Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.
6666	IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.
6667	Comment.
6668	I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
6669	I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
6670	Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
6671	In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
6672	It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
6673	PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
6674	She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
6675	We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
6676	We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
6677	It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.
6678	For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
6679	I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
6680	She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
6681	We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

7484	Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey
7485	MR#  0942207
7486	Date of Admission:  8/26/66
7487	Attending: Yoel Pollard
7488	PCP:  Susan Ullom
7489	CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status
7490	HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)
7491	Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.
7492	She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66.
7493	Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.
7494	She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.
7495	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed.
7496	However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.
7497	8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear.
7498	U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin.
7499	There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.
7500	Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.
7501	Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days.
7502	She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.
7503	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus.
7504	She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.
7505	PMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)

7613	No change in ventricle size.

7616	Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale
7617	"	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due"
7618	"	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup."
7619	"EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals."
7620	Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam.
7621	No evidence of acute ischemia.
7622	Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.
7623	Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source.
7624	Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66.
7625	Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.
7626	-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures
7627	-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism
7628	UTI
7629	-likely UTI- tx
7630	-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source
7631	-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic
7632	-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data
7633	-change foley now
7634	-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics
7635	Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status
7636	-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
7637	If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection
7638	-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm.
7639	If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic.
7640	If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.
7641	DM
7642	-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements
7643	Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH

7651	"Chief Complaint	"
7652	Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 
7653	"History of Present Illness	"
7654	I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM.
7655	BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD
7656	Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it.
7657	The pharmacy didn't give it to her.
7658	Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.
7659	Feels well.
7660	Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.
7661	Denies CP, SOB, palpitations
7662	Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her.
7663	Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.
7664	Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass.
7665	Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI.
7666	She had it done few 9/86.
7667	Recommended to repeat it soon.
7668	Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2.
7669	However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F.

8034	No chest pain to suggest recent MI.
8035	No sign of PE.
8036	Hemodynamically stable.
8037	CHADS2 score 2, so warfarin is indicated for anticoagulation.
8038	Unclear when this rhythm started, so will hold off on cardioversion.
8039	- Rate control with po diltiazem
8040	- Warfarin for anticoagulation; follow INR

8061	I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.
8062	I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.
8063	Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.
8064	I would only add/emphasize the following:
8065	Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 
8066	h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
8067	Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
8068	Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
8069	Pneumonia several times in the past 
8070	Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
8071	Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
8072	Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
8073	Elevated lipids - on statin 
8074	Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.)
8075	Kidney stones 
8076	Patent foramen ovale
8077	He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.
8078	He has improved with heart rate control.
8079	Exam
8080	VS - as noted
8081	General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.
8082	Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.
8083	CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
8084	Lungs - clear
8085	Abdomen - obese
8086	Extremities - minimal edema
8087	Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.
8088	Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.
8089	Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.
8090	Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.
8091	"I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission."
8092	Recommendations:  
8093	Increase metoprolol dose.
8094	May need Toprol XL 100 BID.
8095	Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.
8096	Filter all IVs (PFO)
8097	PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
8098	Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

8128	He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load.
8129	Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help.
8130	Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic.
8131	EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec).
