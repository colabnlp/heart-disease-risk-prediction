63	1	a	NAME:    Justus, Quiana
64	1	a	MRN:       9814048
65	1	a	Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
66	1	a	comes in for a physical.
67	1	a	She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's.
68	1	a	She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and
69	1	a	calves.
70	1	a	She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not
71	1	a	occur after short 5-minute distances.
72	1	a	The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.
73	1	a	She
74	1	a	does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.

120	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.
121	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.
122	1	a	She has not had a recent tetanus shot.
123	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress.
124	1	a	Her blood
125	1	a	pressure here is 150/90.
126	1	a	Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
127	1	a	Lungs are clear
128	1	a	without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.

140	1	a	edema.
141	1	a	Her distal pulses are 2+.
142	1	a	Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.
143	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
144	1	a	(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.
145	1	a	This is probably due to her
146	1	a	     spinal stenosis.
147	1	a	However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
148	1	a	     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
149	1	a	We will check lower extremity noninvasive
150	1	a	     arterial studies to rule out claudication.
151	1	a	She can take the Vioxx p.r.n.
152	1	a	for her
153	1	a	     foot pain which I do not think is related.
154	1	a	(2)  Type 2 diabetes.
155	1	a	She needs a hemoglobin A1c.
156	1	a	Her blood pressure ideally
157	1	a	     should be under 130/85.
158	1	a	She reports that it is consistently below that level
159	1	a	     when her daughter checks it.
160	1	a	She needs as chem-7.
161	1	a	She has no evidence for
162	1	a	     neuropathy at this time.
163	1	a	(3)  Health maintenance.
164	1	a	She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today.
165	1	a	Will check stool guaiacs x 3.
166	1	a	We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.
167	1	a	She will follow
168	1	a	up in six months and p.r.n.
169	1	a	She was given a
170	1	a	tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

174	1	a	CARDIOLOGY
175	1	a	PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
176	1	a	Reason for visit:
177	1	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
178	1	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
179	1	a	Interval History:
180	1	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
181	1	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
182	1	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
183	1	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
184	1	a	She had global hypokinesis.
185	1	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
186	1	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
187	1	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
188	1	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
189	1	a	BNP elevated at 500.
190	1	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
191	1	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
192	1	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
193	1	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
194	1	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
195	1	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
196	1	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
197	1	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
198	1	a	Lasix 20mg
199	1	a	Toprol XL 50mg
200	1	a	ASA 325mg
201	1	a	Zestril 20mg
202	1	a	Lantus 10 units hs
203	1	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
204	1	a	Multivitamin
205	1	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
206	1	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
207	1	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.
208	1	a	Past medical history:

220	1	a	Family history:
221	1	a	   No significant cardiac disease
222	1	a	Social history:
223	1	a	   She and her husband are doing well.
224	1	a	She has retired.
225	1	a	Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.
226	1	a	Review of systems:
227	1	a	   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.
228	1	a	Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.
229	1	a	Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.
230	1	a	Physical examination:
231	1	a	-BP: 130/80  
232	1	a	-General appearance:   No acute distress.
233	1	a	-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.
234	1	a	-Heent:   Unremarkable
235	1	a	-Neck:   CVP 8.
236	1	a	No carotid bruits
237	1	a	-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
238	1	a	-Cardiac:   S1 S2.
239	1	a	No significant murmurs.
240	1	a	PMI normal.
241	2	a	-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly
242	1	a	-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema
243	1	a	-Neuro:   Non-focal
244	1	a	-Pulse: 89  
245	1	a	EKG:
246	1	a	   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.
247	1	a	Impression:
248	1	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
249	1	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
250	1	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
251	1	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
252	1	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
253	1	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
254	1	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
255	1	a	She relates that she will call our office.

672	1	a	Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.
673	1	a	No acute intracranial process.
674	1	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
675	2	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
676	1	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
677	1	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
678	1	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
679	1	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
680	1	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
681	1	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
682	1	a	Recommendations:
683	1	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
684	1	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
685	1	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
686	1	a	-Continue statin.
687	1	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

755	1	a	Impression and Plan
756	1	a	Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy.
757	1	a	Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration.
758	1	a	However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration.
759	1	a	Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.
760	1	a	I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies.
761	1	a	Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment.
762	1	a	For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.
763	1	a	Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.
764	1	a	At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

851	1	a	None
852	1	a	RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES
853	1	a	CXR - No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
854	1	a	EKG &#8211; Sinus tachycardia.
855	1	a	Rate 106.
856	1	a	Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3.
857	1	a	Slightly changed from prior.
858	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
859	1	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
860	1	a	She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.
861	1	a	##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
862	1	a	Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.
863	1	a	A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
864	1	a	Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.
865	1	a	Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
866	1	a	Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.
867	1	a	Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
868	1	a	Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
869	1	a	Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
870	1	a	Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion
871	1	a	Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
872	1	a	##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
873	1	a	Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.
874	1	a	Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
875	1	a	Check orthostatics
876	1	a	Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.
877	1	a	Monitor on telemetry.
878	1	a	Physical therapy consult.
879	1	a	##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.
880	1	a	Fe, TIBC, ferritin
881	1	a	Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia
882	1	a	##: Elevated anion gap.
883	1	a	Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.
884	1	a	Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.
885	1	a	There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.
886	1	a	pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.
887	1	a	AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).
888	1	a	Check lactate
889	1	a	Repeat AG
890	1	a	##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.
891	1	a	UA and CXR were negative.
892	1	a	If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.
893	1	a	Repeat CBC
894	1	a	##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide
895	1	a	Finger sticks AC with RISS
896	1	a	##: Schizophrenia &#8211; continue trilafon
897	1	a	##: Insomnia &#8211; continue seroquel, ambient

899	1	a	##: Hyperlipidemia &#8211; continue simvastatin

968	1	a	Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.
969	1	a	2.
970	1	a	Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).
971	1	a	Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.
972	1	a	3.
973	1	a	Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.
974	1	a	This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.
975	1	a	4.
976	1	a	He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.

987	1	a	she has now seen Dr. Urie who has recommended that she undergo a CABG which is scheduled for may.
988	1	a	pt expected her cath findings and recommendation.
989	1	a	she is ok w undergoing surgery --both her parents underwent--but has fears re the post-op pain control which was very difficult for both her parents.
990	1	a	she did not discuss when she last saw dr urie.

1241	1	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
1242	1	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
1243	1	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
1244	1	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
1245	1	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
1246	1	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
1247	1	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
1248	1	a	Will discuss with Drs.
1249	1	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
1250	1	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
1251	1	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
1252	1	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
1253	1	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
1254	1	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
1255	1	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
1256	1	a	Follow sugars while in house
1257	1	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

1382	1	a	TRANSPLANT FELLOW ADMIT NOTE
1383	1	a	HPI: 42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplantation for bronchiectasis in 7/73 transferred from Burlington Obstetrics Gynecology Center for further evaluation of N/V/D, fever and hypoxia.
1384	1	a	Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function  prompting a recent admission here 1/23 -25/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection.
1385	1	a	He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission.
1386	1	a	Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1/25/77.
1387	1	a	Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge.
1388	1	a	Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds).
1389	1	a	He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea.
1390	1	a	Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen.
1391	1	a	GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO.
1392	1	a	Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness.
1393	1	a	Currently no dyspnea at rest.
1394	2	a	PMH: OSA, obesity, osteoporosis, gout, HTN, CRI, avascular necrosis of R hip/knee, depression, psoriasis
1395	1	a	Current Meds: 
1396	1	a	Imm: neoral 125 mg po bid, cellcept 500 mg po bid, prednisone 30 mg po qd
1397	1	a	Abx: levaquin 500 mg po qd (1/25), bactrim ss 1 po tiw, acyclovir 200 mg po tid

1414	1	a	Nasal swab 1/31/77 - negative viral panel
1415	1	a	Lung washings 1/23/77 - moderate M. catarrhalis
1416	1	a	Path: Transbrochial biopsy 1/23 - negative for tissue rejection
1417	1	a	CXR 1/31: Unremarkable 
1418	1	a	Impression: 
1419	1	a	42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplant 7/73 for bronchiectasis developed acute GI illness in setting of levaquin tx for recent respiratory infection.
1420	1	a	Now afebrile and with resolution of GI symptoms.
1421	1	a	Remains somewhat dyspneic with normal BP and HR.
1422	1	a	Azotemia possibly attributable to dehydration though concern for other etiologies as per Dr. Reilly's note.
1423	1	a	WBCs reduced from recent levels.
1424	1	a	Recommendations: 
1425	1	a	GI illness: Mostly asymptomatic now though some concerning abnormalities remain (O2 requirement, low plt, low WBC, high Cr).
1426	1	a	Remains hemodynamically stable.
1427	1	a	Await results of panculture including stool studies (including C diff, E coli, Camphylobacter) when available.
1428	1	a	Transplant: Continue current immunosuppression and prophylactic abx.
1429	1	a	Will consider holding cellcept, valcyte if leukopenia persists/worsens.
1430	1	a	Follow daily cyclosporin troughs.
1431	1	a	No evidence of rejection on recent biopsy.
1432	1	a	Dyspnea: Consider aspiration though CXR negative, will follow.
1433	1	a	Hold abx for now.
1434	1	a	Renal: Azotemia of unclear etiology, follow up labs pending.
1435	1	a	Renal consult per Dr. Reilly.

1625	2	a	HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, 
1626	1	a	complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane.
1627	1	a	She comes in today for routine follow-up.
1628	1	a	Patient's diabetes was 
1629	1	a	initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.
1630	1	a	Patient was 
1631	1	a	formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 
1632	1	a	months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have 
1633	1	a	been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.
1634	1	a	Patient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser 
1635	1	a	treatment to the cervix.
1636	1	a	She is a hemophiliac carrier.
1637	1	a	Has a history of 
1638	1	a	migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.
1639	1	a	Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide 
1640	1	a	in July.
1641	1	a	It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut 
1642	1	a	her left upper extremity.
1643	1	a	Since then she states that she has been feeling 
1644	1	a	a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.
1645	1	a	Her mood seems fine today in clinic.
1646	1	a	Patient denies any medical symptoms 
1647	1	a	at this time.
1648	1	a	Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.
1649	1	a	A 
1650	1	a	positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who 
1651	1	a	just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at 
1652	1	a	age 40 and a CABG at age 43.
1653	1	a	Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia 
1654	1	a	or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.
1655	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks 
1656	1	a	about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.
1657	1	a	She says that she should not be drinking with her medications.
1658	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.
1659	1	a	Blood pressure: 120/70.
1660	1	a	HEENT: unremarkable.
1661	1	a	Neck: no JVD, carotids were

1670	1	a	Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 
1671	1	a	     16 months.
1672	1	a	I told her how impressed I was with this.
1673	1	a	She, in fact, 
1674	1	a	     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at 
1675	1	a	     this time.
1676	1	a	I will let her continue this dietary control for the next 
1677	1	a	     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her 
1678	1	a	     control.
1679	1	a	However, in the past, she has been very straight forward 
1680	1	a	     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.
1681	1	a	2.
1682	1	a	Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.
1683	1	a	Is 
1684	1	a	     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.
1685	1	a	She will

1693	1	a	     in June.
1694	1	a	She does not take oral contraceptives because of her 
1695	1	a	     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.
1696	1	a	She was instructed 
1697	1	a	     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to 
1698	1	a	     the IUD occur.

1725	1	a	Dizziness and change in mental status
1726	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
1727	1	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o, who p/w dizziness that began 2 to 3 weeks ago.
1728	1	a	The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving.
1729	1	a	The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down.
1730	1	a	He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.
1731	1	a	He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped.
1732	1	a	He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages.
1733	1	a	During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious.
1734	1	a	He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication.
1735	1	a	Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
1736	1	a	Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.
1737	1	a	Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.

1859	1	a	Chronic infarctions of the pons and right frontal operculum, unchanged.

1862	1	a	PR&lt; 200 ms, QRS&lt; 110 ms, QTc&gt;470
1863	1	a	ASSESSMENT
1864	1	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
1865	1	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
1866	1	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
1867	1	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
1868	1	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
1869	1	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
1870	1	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
1871	1	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
1872	1	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
1873	1	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
1874	1	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
1875	1	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
1876	1	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
1877	1	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
1878	1	a	PLAN
1879	1	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
1880	1	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
1881	1	a	-D/c naproxen use.
1882	1	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
1883	1	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
1884	1	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
1885	1	a	#) DM
1886	1	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.
1887	1	a	#) CAD
1888	1	a	      -Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF
1889	1	a	#) HTN
1890	1	a	-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.
1891	1	a	#) Gout
1892	1	a	      -D/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves
1893	1	a	#)Hypercholesterolemia
1894	1	a	-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin  20 MG PO QHS)
1895	1	a	#) Psoriasis
1896	1	a	-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005%   TOP BID prn
1897	1	a	#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy
1898	1	a	      -Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.

1909	1	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
1910	1	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
1911	1	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
1912	1	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
1913	1	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
1914	1	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
1915	1	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
1916	1	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
1917	1	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
1918	1	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
1919	1	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
1920	1	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
1921	1	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
1922	1	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
1923	1	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
1924	1	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
1925	1	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.
1926	1	a	Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

2123	1	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
2124	1	a	Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.
2125	1	a	Currently, she complains of
2126	1	a	exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral
2127	1	a	edema.
2128	1	a	Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite
2129	1	a	difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing
2130	2	a	members of our obesity clinic.
2131	1	a	As you know, in the past, she
2132	1	a	also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or
2133	1	a	other invasive studies.
2134	1	a	Presently, she remains on a regimen of
2135	1	a	enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2136	1	a	q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
2137	1	a	q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
2138	1	a	b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.
2139	1	a	q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o.
2140	1	a	q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o.
2141	1	a	q.d., potassium,
2142	1	a	10 mEq p.o.
2143	1	a	q.d.
2144	1	a	Pumex 2 mg p.o.
2145	1	a	q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,
2146	1	a	Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units
2147	1	a	subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.
2148	1	a	Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no
2149	1	a	acute distress.
2150	1	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,
2151	1	a	heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and
2152	1	a	unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10
2153	1	a	months ago.
2154	1	a	The neck is soft.
2155	1	a	JVP is flat.
2156	1	a	Carotids without
2157	1	a	significant bruits.
2158	1	a	Chest is clear.
2159	1	a	Cardiac exam reveals a
2160	1	a	normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic
2161	1	a	murmur radiating from apex to the base.
2162	1	a	No significant diastolic
2163	1	a	murmur or rub.
2164	1	a	The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.
2165	1	a	Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are
2166	1	a	intact albeit mildly diminished.
2167	1	a	Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS
2168	1	a	response.
2169	1	a	The P waves are more organized than one might usually
2170	1	a	see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well.
2171	1	a	QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior
2172	1	a	inferior myocardial infarction.
2173	1	a	Compared with his last
2174	1	a	electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.
2175	2	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,
2176	1	a	and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding
2177	1	a	the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh
2178	1	a	reduction program.
2179	1	a	I once again have strongly encouraged her to
2180	2	a	make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in
2181	1	a	extensive weight reduction.
2182	1	a	I also discussed with her my
2183	1	a	concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral
2184	1	a	edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial
2185	1	a	or tachyarrhythmias.
2186	1	a	As in the past, she told me that she would
2187	1	a	refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other
2188	1	a	studies.
2189	1	a	She did, however, agree to continue with her current
2190	1	a	medical regimen.
2191	1	a	I obtained routine blood studies today to
2192	1	a	verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.
2193	1	a	I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who
2194	1	a	will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he
2195	1	a	next few weeks.
2196	1	a	We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn
2197	1	a	to begin at 2.5 mg p.o.
2198	1	a	q.d., which will help result in some
2199	1	a	degree of mild diuresis.
2200	1	a	Nonetheless, she understands that
2201	1	a	significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction
2202	1	a	program.
2203	1	a	I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac
2204	1	a	morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.
2205	1	a	Beyond this, I
2206	1	a	have not altered her current medical regimen.
2207	1	a	Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.
2208	1	a	Sincerely yours,

2219	1	a	95718084
2220	1	a	10/26/2073
2221	1	a	To Whom It May Concern:
2222	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
2223	2	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
2224	1	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
2225	1	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
2226	1	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
2227	1	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
2228	1	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
2229	1	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
2230	2	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
2231	1	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
2232	1	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
2233	1	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
2234	1	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
2235	2	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.
2236	1	a	Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
2237	1	a	daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
2238	1	a	daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
2239	1	a	daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o.
2240	1	a	daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
2241	1	a	daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o.
2242	1	a	daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
2243	1	a	daily.
2244	1	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
2245	1	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
2246	1	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
2247	1	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
2248	1	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
2249	1	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
2250	2	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
2251	1	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
2252	1	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
2253	1	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
2254	2	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
2255	1	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
2256	1	a	He has good distal pulsations.
2257	1	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
2258	1	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
2259	1	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
2260	1	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
2261	1	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
2262	2	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
2263	1	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
2264	1	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
2265	1	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
2266	1	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
2267	1	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
2268	1	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
2269	1	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
2270	1	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
2271	1	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
2272	1	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
2273	1	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
2274	1	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
2275	1	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
2276	1	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
2277	1	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
2278	1	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
2279	1	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
2280	1	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
2281	1	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
2282	1	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
2283	1	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
2284	1	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
2285	1	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
2286	1	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
2287	1	a	Thank you.
2288	1	a	Sincerely,

2314	1	a	I admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.
2315	1	a	She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.
2316	1	a	Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.
2317	1	a	She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.
2318	1	a	Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .
2319	1	a	She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.
2320	2	a	As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.
2321	1	a	In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.
2322	1	a	There was no evidence of hemolysis.
2323	1	a	She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.
2324	1	a	There was no evidence of active bleeding.
2325	1	a	She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.
2326	1	a	She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.
2327	1	a	Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.
2328	1	a	Today, she feels reasonably well.
2329	1	a	She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.
2330	1	a	She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.
2331	1	a	She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.
2332	1	a	Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.
2333	1	a	Hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.

2381	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.
2382	1	a	General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.
2383	1	a	HEENT is unremarkable.
2384	1	a	Neck is supple.
2385	1	a	No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.

2391	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
2392	1	a	Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.
2393	1	a	She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.
2394	1	a	She will check daily weights.
2395	1	a	I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.
2396	1	a	Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.
2397	1	a	Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.
2398	1	a	Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.
2399	1	a	COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.
2400	1	a	We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.
2401	1	a	Chronic renal insufficiency.
2402	1	a	Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.
2403	1	a	She will need to be watched closely.
2404	1	a	She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.
2405	1	a	There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.
2406	1	a	I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.
2407	1	a	Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.
2408	1	a	She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.
2409	1	a	Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.
2410	1	a	She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.
2411	1	a	this might not be a bad idea.
2412	1	a	She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.
2413	1	a	GI.
2414	1	a	She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.
2415	1	a	Heme.
2416	1	a	Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.
2417	1	a	She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.
2418	1	a	She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.
2419	1	a	In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.
2420	1	a	If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.
2421	1	a	I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.
2422	1	a	Health care maintenance.
2423	1	a	Labs today.
2424	1	a	H1N1 vaccine today.
2425	1	a	Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.
2426	1	a	She wishes to be full code at present.
2427	1	a	I will see her again in 4 weeks.
2428	1	a	Visit length 60 minutes.

2732	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Follow-up laboratory testing.
2733	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old white
2734	1	a	man who I have not seen since November of 2088.
2735	1	a	Approximately
2736	1	a	four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.
2737	1	a	He saw colored
2738	1	a	spots floating in his visual field.
2739	1	a	He has been noting some
2740	1	a	decreased depth perception and visual acuity.
2741	1	a	At the same time,
2742	1	a	he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he
2743	1	a	believes were migraines.
2744	1	a	He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.
2745	1	a	He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation.
2746	1	a	Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits.
2747	1	a	However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which
2748	1	a	came back at 10.2.
2749	1	a	Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I
2750	1	a	had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly
2751	1	a	elevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.
2752	1	a	He
2753	1	a	never returned for that testing.
2754	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
2755	2	a	obesity, and gout.
2756	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o.
2757	1	a	q.d.,  Atenolol 50 mg p.o.
2758	1	a	b.i.d.,
2759	1	a	allopurinol 300 mg p.o.
2760	1	a	q.d.
2761	1	a	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
2762	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney
2763	1	a	failure.
2764	1	a	This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.
2765	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.
2766	1	a	He is
2767	1	a	currently on a leave of absence from work.
2768	1	a	He is a nonsmoker.
2769	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over
2770	1	a	the past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.
2771	1	a	He has been
2772	1	a	noting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and
2773	1	a	nocturia.
2774	1	a	Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,
2775	1	a	respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and
2776	1	a	dermatologic are negative.
2777	2	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white
2778	1	a	man in no acute distress.
2779	1	a	Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse
2780	1	a	66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.
2781	1	a	HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,
2782	1	a	anicteric sclerae.
2783	1	a	Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes.
2784	1	a	Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
2785	1	a	Chest: 
2786	1	a	CTA&P bilaterally.
2787	1	a	Heart: RRR, no MRG.
2788	2	a	Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
2789	1	a	NT/ND, NABS, no HSM.
2790	1	a	Extremities:  No CCE.
2791	1	a	Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+
2792	1	a	DTRs bilaterally.
2793	1	a	LABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per
2794	1	a	minute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.
2795	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
2796	1	a	1.
2797	1	a	Diabetes.
2798	1	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
2799	1	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
2800	1	a	diabetes.
2801	1	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to
2802	1	a	start him on metformin 500 mg p.o.
2803	1	a	Use and side effects
2804	1	a	were reviewed.
2805	1	a	He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and
2806	1	a	fasting lipid profile checked today.
2807	1	a	Unfortunately, he was not
2808	1	a	actually fasting.
2809	1	a	He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and
2810	1	a	Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education.
2811	1	a	He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.
2812	1	a	He is asked
2813	1	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
2814	1	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens
2815	1	a	swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.
2816	1	a	I assume that this
2817	1	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.
2818	1	a	was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job
2819	1	a	until his symptoms clear.
2820	1	a	2.
2821	1	a	Migraines.
2822	1	a	The patient does sound as if he is also having
2823	1	a	migraines.
2824	1	a	We will address this at future visits.

3026	1	a	HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
3027	1	a	significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.
3028	1	a	She is 
3029	1	a	currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
3030	1	a	q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml.
3031	1	a	equivalents PO q.d.
3032	1	a	Patient comes in 
3033	1	a	today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
3034	1	a	baseline examinations.
3035	1	a	On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
3036	1	a	and on check today it was 150/90.
3037	1	a	We discussed the possibility that she 
3038	1	a	continue her salt-restricted diet.
3039	1	a	We also discussed that she continue 
3040	1	a	her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
3041	1	a	the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.
3042	1	a	She currently 
3043	1	a	weighs 199 lbs.
3044	1	a	"and stands approximately 4'9"" tall."
3045	1	a	As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
3046	1	a	pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
3047	1	a	time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
3048	1	a	XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
3049	1	a	gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.
3050	1	a	However, at 
3051	1	a	this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
3052	1	a	and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
3053	1	a	pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
3054	1	a	200s-190s.
3055	1	a	Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
3056	1	a	now appears to be much more stable.
3057	1	a	She is currently living with her 
3058	1	a	mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
3059	1	a	about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.
3060	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.
3061	1	a	Heart: RRR, no 
3062	1	a	murmurs.
3063	2	a	Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
3064	1	a	tenderness.
3065	1	a	She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
3066	1	a	swelling bilaterally at the ankles.
3067	1	a	Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
3068	1	a	or lumps.
3069	1	a	She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
3070	1	a	mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
3071	1	a	guaiacs.
3072	1	a	Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
3073	1	a	issue at this point.

3087	1	a	"      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23"
3088	1	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
3089	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.
3090	1	a	VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.
3091	1	a	Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous.
3092	1	a	For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.
3093	1	a	The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.
3094	1	a	He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.
3095	1	a	He has managed to lose 6 lbs.
3096	1	a	by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.
3097	1	a	GE reflux is very well controlled.
3098	1	a	Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.
3099	1	a	On Examination:  He is well appearing.
3100	1	a	Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.
3101	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
3102	1	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
3103	1	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter.
3104	1	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.
3105	1	a	Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.
3106	2	a	Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
3107	1	a	Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis.
3108	1	a	Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.
3109	1	a	Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.
3110	1	a	Weight is 238 lbs.
3111	0	a	(BMI 38).
3112	1	a	Impression:
3113	1	a	1.
3114	1	a	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.
3115	1	a	I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.
3116	1	a	I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.
3117	1	a	I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.
3118	1	a	If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.
3119	2	a	The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.
3120	1	a	I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs.
3121	1	a	to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.
3122	1	a	Hence, he has his work cut out for him.
3123	1	a	2.
3124	2	a	Obesity - As above.
3125	1	a	3.
3126	1	a	Diabetes.
3127	1	a	4.
3128	1	a	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.
3129	1	a	5.
3130	1	a	GE reflux - As mentioned.
3131	1	a	6.
3132	1	a	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.
3133	1	a	Recommendations:
3134	1	a	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.
3135	1	a	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d.
3136	1	a	- as 20 mg b.i.d.
3137	1	a	did not give full control with the generic pills.
3138	1	a	We will review pathology.
3139	1	a	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.
3140	1	a	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.
3141	1	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
3142	1	a	Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.
3143	1	a	Sincerely,

3155	1	a	Plymouth, IN  46368
3156	1	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
3157	1	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
3158	1	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
3159	1	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
3160	1	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
3161	1	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
3162	1	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
3163	1	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
3164	1	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
3165	1	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
3166	1	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
3167	1	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
3168	1	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
3169	2	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
3170	1	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
3171	1	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
3172	1	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
3173	1	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
3174	1	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
3175	1	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
3176	1	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
3177	1	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
3178	1	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
3179	1	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
3180	1	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
3181	1	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
3182	1	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
3183	1	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
3184	1	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
3185	1	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
3186	2	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
3187	1	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
3188	1	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
3189	1	a	Chest is clear.
3190	1	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
3191	1	a	PMI is normal.
3192	1	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
3193	1	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
3194	1	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
3195	2	a	The abdomen is obese.
3196	1	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
3197	1	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
3198	1	a	Distal pulses are normal.
3199	1	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
3200	1	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
3201	1	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
3202	1	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
3203	1	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
3204	1	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
3205	1	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
3206	1	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
3207	1	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
3208	1	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
3209	1	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
3210	1	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
3211	1	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
3212	1	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
3213	1	a	Kindest personal regards.

3444	1	a	HBH: 
3445	1	a	            406-70-33
3446	1	a	DOB:               3/22/68
3447	1	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
3448	1	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
3449	1	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
3450	1	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
3451	1	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
3452	1	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
3453	1	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
3454	1	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
3455	1	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
3456	1	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
3457	1	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
3458	1	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
3459	2	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
3460	1	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
3461	1	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
3462	1	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
3463	1	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
3464	1	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
3465	2	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
3466	1	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
3467	1	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
3468	1	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
3469	1	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
3470	1	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
3471	1	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
3472	1	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
3473	1	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
3474	1	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
3475	1	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
3476	1	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
3477	1	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
3478	1	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
3479	1	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
3480	1	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
3481	1	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
3482	1	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
3483	1	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
3484	2	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
3485	1	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
3486	1	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
3487	1	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
3488	2	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
3489	1	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
3490	1	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
3491	1	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
3492	1	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
3493	1	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
3494	1	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
3495	1	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
3496	1	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
3497	1	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
3498	1	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
3499	1	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
3500	1	a	Sincerely,
3501	1	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

3704	1	a	"Re:	Horn, Gregory"
3705	1	a	"	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23"
3706	1	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
3707	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease.
3708	1	a	He has managed to lose 3 lbs.
3709	1	a	on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.
3710	1	a	His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.
3711	1	a	They both attribute it to the Prilosec.
3712	1	a	He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.
3713	1	a	He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.
3714	1	a	Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.
3715	1	a	No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.
3716	1	a	Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.
3717	1	a	On examination, he is well appearing.
3718	1	a	Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored.
3719	1	a	Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff.
3720	1	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
3721	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
3722	1	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy.
3723	1	a	Back:  Normal configuration.
3724	1	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.
3725	1	a	Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.
3726	1	a	JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.
3727	1	a	Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
3728	1	a	Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.
3729	1	a	Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.
3730	1	a	My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.
3731	1	a	Impression:
3732	1	a	1.
3733	1	a	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.
3734	1	a	Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
3735	1	a	However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.
3736	1	a	There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.
3737	1	a	He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.
3738	1	a	2.
3739	1	a	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
3740	1	a	If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.
3741	1	a	3.
3742	1	a	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
3743	1	a	4.
3744	1	a	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.
3745	1	a	5.
3746	1	a	Chronic cough.
3747	1	a	6.
3748	1	a	Diabetes - Better controlled.
3749	1	a	7.
3750	2	a	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.
3751	1	a	As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.
3752	1	a	Recommendations:
3753	1	a	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d.
3754	1	a	dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.
3755	1	a	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
3756	1	a	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.
3757	1	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
3758	1	a	Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.
3759	1	a	Sincerely, 
3760	1	a	Paul N. Tam, M.D.

4113	1	a	for the last year, which he discontinued 
4114	1	a	last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
4115	1	a	he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
4116	1	a	he is afraid that his sugar is up.
4117	1	a	He states that over the last two or 
4118	1	a	three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
4119	1	a	followed by mild headaches.
4120	1	a	He says that the visual changes are usually 
4121	1	a	accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with

4123	1	a	He does admit to a history of 
4124	1	a	migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more

4126	1	a	migraine aura.
4127	1	a	He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
4128	1	a	they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come

4139	1	a	this in the past.
4140	1	a	His past medical history is otherwise benign.
4141	1	a	Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
4142	1	a	basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
4143	1	a	pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
4144	1	a	from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
4145	1	a	frequently.
4146	1	a	He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.
4147	1	a	He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.

4188	1	a	     diet.
4189	1	a	3.
4190	1	a	Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.
4191	1	a	I will get a

4225	1	a	Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.
4226	1	a	However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.
4227	1	a	Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.
4228	1	a	He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.
4229	1	a	Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.
4230	1	a	The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.
4231	1	a	However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.
4232	1	a	Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.

4521	1	a	ASSESSMENT
4522	1	a	33 y.o.
4523	1	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
4524	1	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
4525	1	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
4526	1	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
4527	1	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
4528	1	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
4529	1	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
4530	1	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
4531	1	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
4532	1	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
4533	1	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
4534	1	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
4535	1	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
4536	1	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
4537	1	a	No concentrated sweets diet
4538	1	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
4539	1	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
4540	1	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
4541	1	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
4542	1	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
4543	1	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

4552	1	a	HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
4553	2	a	dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
4554	1	a	learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
4555	1	a	presenting for follow up of his DVT.
4556	1	a	The patient's current medical 
4557	1	a	problems include:
4558	1	a	1.
4559	1	a	Recent DVT.
4560	1	a	The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
4561	1	a	     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.
4562	1	a	The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
4563	1	a	     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
4564	1	a	     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
4565	1	a	     previously over the recent few weeks.
4566	1	a	The patient stated he awoke 
4567	1	a	     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
4568	1	a	     quadriceps and right calf.
4569	1	a	He later developed progressive swelling 
4570	1	a	     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
4571	1	a	     department.
4572	1	a	He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
4573	1	a	     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.
4574	1	a	He was 
4575	1	a	     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
4576	1	a	The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
4577	1	a	     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
4578	1	a	     sent off which was negative.
4579	1	a	The patient currently returns to me 
4580	1	a	     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.
4581	1	a	He states that 
4582	1	a	     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
4583	1	a	     occur during his hospital course.
4584	1	a	The patient was also angry and 
4585	1	a	     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.
4586	1	a	I 
4587	1	a	     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
4588	1	a	     his emergency department visit.
4589	1	a	I called all of the parties 
4590	1	a	     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
4591	1	a	     occurred.
4592	1	a	2.
4593	1	a	Hypertension.
4594	1	a	The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
4595	1	a	     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
4596	1	a	     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
4597	1	a	     discontinued recently.
4598	1	a	With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
4599	1	a	     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
4600	1	a	3.
4601	1	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
4602	1	a	I recently started the patient on 
4603	1	a	     insulin.
4604	1	a	He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
4605	1	a	     did not make his visit.
4606	1	a	His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
4607	1	a	     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
4608	1	a	     the morning and 15 units of regular.
4609	1	a	In the evening he takes 10 
4610	1	a	     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.
4611	1	a	The patient does not yet have 
4612	1	a	     a home glucometer.
4613	1	a	We will arrange for this.

4616	1	a	Physical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.
4617	1	a	Blood 
4618	1	a	pressure: 135/92.
4619	1	a	Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.
4620	1	a	HEENT: pupils 
4621	1	a	equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, 
4622	1	a	oropharynx clear.
4623	1	a	Mucous membranes moist.
4624	1	a	Cardiac: regular rate and 
4625	1	a	rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
4626	1	a	Lungs: clear to 
4627	1	a	ausculation.
4628	1	a	Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.
4629	1	a	Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
4630	1	a	significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.
4631	1	a	Impression:
4632	1	a	1)   DVT.
4633	1	a	Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
4634	1	a	     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.
4635	1	a	     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
4636	1	a	My feeling is that the DVT 
4637	1	a	     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
4638	1	a	     therapeutic at the present time.
4639	1	a	I have arranged for the patient to 
4640	1	a	     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
4641	1	a	     check of his PT.
4642	1	a	I left instructions that I should be called 
4643	1	a	     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
4644	1	a	     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
4645	1	a	     cane to help with ambulation.
4646	1	a	2)   Adult onset diabetes.
4647	1	a	I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
4648	1	a	     next office visit.
4649	1	a	A finger stick in the office approximately three 
4650	1	a	     hours after eating is 253.
4651	1	a	I feel this is still too elevated.
4652	1	a	     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.
4653	1	a	     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
4654	1	a	     adjustments in his medications at that time.

4726	1	a	No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
4727	1	a	EKG: no ischemic changes
4728	1	a	Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.
4729	1	a	Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.
4730	1	a	Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.
4731	1	a	Plan:
4732	1	a	--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.
4733	1	a	--complete cycling enzymes
4734	1	a	--continue outpatient lasix dose.
4735	1	a	--adjust n/c oxygen as needed
4736	1	a	--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.
4737	1	a	--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.
4738	1	a	This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.
4739	1	a	--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.
4740	1	a	--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.
4741	1	a	-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.
4742	1	a	-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)
4743	1	a	-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

4844	1	a	Record date: 2072-01-25
4845	1	a	Patient Name: NARVAEZ, OTIS;  MRN: 6680255
4846	1	a	Dictated at: 01/25/72 by HOLLAND KELLER, M.D.
4847	1	a	PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
4848	1	a	Dr. Hayden Avery 
4849	1	a	REFERRAL SOURCE:  
4850	1	a	Above.
4851	1	a	CONSULTATION REPLY 
4852	1	a	Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.
4853	1	a	I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.
4854	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.
4855	2	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.
4856	1	a	He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.
4857	1	a	If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.
4858	1	a	This is relieved by sitting.
4859	1	a	It will happen when walking as well.
4860	1	a	This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
4861	1	a	He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.
4862	1	a	Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.
4863	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.
4864	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.
4865	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.
4866	1	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s.
4867	1	a	and Selexa.
4868	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.
4869	1	a	BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.
4870	1	a	EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.
4871	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.
4872	1	a	He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.
4873	1	a	He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.
4874	1	a	He has no HIV risk factors.
4875	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.
4876	1	a	He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.
4877	1	a	He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.
4878	1	a	When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.
4879	1	a	There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.
4880	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.
4881	1	a	Pulse of 60 and regular.
4882	1	a	Carotids 2+ without bruits.
4883	1	a	Mental status:  Unremarkable.
4884	1	a	Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.
4885	1	a	No evidence of retinopathy.
4886	1	a	Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.
4887	1	a	Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
4888	1	a	Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
4889	1	a	Rapid alternating movements intact.
4890	1	a	Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
4891	1	a	Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
4892	1	a	The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.
4893	1	a	Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.
4894	1	a	Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.
4895	1	a	He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.
4896	1	a	He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.
4897	1	a	DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
4898	1	a	Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
4899	1	a	The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
4900	1	a	ASSESSMENT:  
4901	1	a	1.
4902	1	a	Neuropathy.
4903	1	a	The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
4904	1	a	He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
4905	1	a	He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.
4906	1	a	There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
4907	1	a	I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.
4908	1	a	I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
4909	1	a	He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
4910	1	a	I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
4911	1	a	Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.
4912	1	a	The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
4913	1	a	DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

5214	1	a	Imaging:
5215	1	a	PE-Protocol CT Scan CHEST/legs , Impression and Critical Findings:      1.No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
5216	1	a	Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.
5217	1	a	2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.
5218	1	a	Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.
5219	1	a	Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.
5220	1	a	3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.
5221	1	a	There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.
5222	1	a	The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.
5223	1	a	4.
5224	1	a	There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.
5225	1	a	They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.
5226	1	a	The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis.
5227	1	a	The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.
5228	1	a	There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.
5229	1	a	5.
5230	1	a	Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.
5231	1	a	Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT.
5232	1	a	Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.
5233	1	a	Assessment:
5234	1	a	" 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back."""
5235	1	a	Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.
5236	1	a	No other major symptoms.
5237	1	a	Plan:
5238	1	a	#
5239	1	a	 SOB
5240	1	a	Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.
5241	1	a	Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday.
5242	1	a	Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection.
5243	1	a	Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).
5244	1	a	-Large acute PE ruled out with CT
5245	1	a	-?
5246	1	a	of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea
5247	1	a	-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
5248	1	a	-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.
5249	1	a	BNP is not very high.
5250	1	a	However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.
5251	1	a	Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
5252	1	a	-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.
5253	1	a	Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.
5254	1	a	-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) 
5255	1	a	 NSCLC
5256	1	a	Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.
5257	1	a	Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.
5258	1	a	-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey
5259	1	a	-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u
5260	1	a	#Anxiety/Depression
5261	1	a	Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.
5262	1	a	Additionally takes seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine.
5263	1	a	Patient is very anxious on exam with intermittent crying, fearful expression.
5264	1	a	-Continue on home regimen Seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine
5265	1	a	-Clonazepam  0.25 QAM, 0.5 mg QHS, 0.25 daily PRN while in house
5266	1	a	#Cardiac: Continue with home meds, will diurese as above for possible CHF exacerbation
5267	1	a	 -Continue ASA, metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin

5737	1	a	CXR:   Clear.
5738	1	a	No PNA or edema
5739	1	a	ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
5740	1	a	Impression:  
5741	1	a	Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
5742	1	a	His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
5743	1	a	His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
5744	1	a	He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
5745	1	a	Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
5746	1	a	Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.
5747	1	a	Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
5748	1	a	He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
5749	1	a	His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
5750	1	a	He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
5751	1	a	Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
5752	1	a	His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.
5753	1	a	Plan: 
5754	1	a	"1)	GI Bleed"

5774	1	a	HPI: 61y/o male who underwent heart transplant in 2083 and has ESRD on HD (recently started -&gt; 9 sessions so far FAT).
5775	1	a	He is been electively admitted from his cardiologists office w/ slightly elevated troponins peaked at 0.41, most recent 0.24.
5776	1	a	He is CP free and stable and is being transferred for further evaluation and work up.
5777	1	a	Last HD session on Tuesday.
5778	1	a	Last dobutamine echo last year showed some LV apex hypokinesis, which augments in response dobutamine.
5779	1	a	ECG revealed NSR at 82 w/ poor R wave progression on anterior leads.
5780	1	a	Qwave on AvL but no new TWI or ST changes.
5781	1	a	Echo at OSH reveiled lower EF at 30-35% with HK on anteroseptal, mid anterior, apical lateral and apical inferior walls segments.
5782	1	a	He reports chronic dypsnea on moderate exertion.
5783	1	a	He is quite sedentary.
5784	1	a	ROS: preserved appetite.
5785	2	a	PMH: CAD, obesity, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea wears cpap at night, ESRD hemodialysis dependent, depression and GERD.
5786	1	a	His current medications include aspirin 81 mg p.o.

5811	1	a	IMPRESSION
5812	1	a	61 yo M s/p heart transplant and ESRD on HD presenting with elevated troponin.
5813	1	a	The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
5814	1	a	Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration.
5815	1	a	On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin.
5816	1	a	The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis.
5817	1	a	&gt; Continue other home meds.
5818	1	a	&gt; Check CSA level in am.
5819	1	a	&gt; Since stable volume status, consider contacting renal in am for further decision about next HD session depending on lab results.
5820	1	a	&gt; Will continue lasix on nonHD days.
5821	1	a	&gt; Will defer further testing to primary cardiologist in am.
5822	1	a	&gt; CPAP at night
5823	1	a	&gt; Keep NPO after MN.
5824	1	a	&gt; Will check PTH, iron store, Ca/PO4 and 25 vitD.

6231	1	a	She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.
6232	1	a	Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.
6233	1	a	On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.
6234	1	a	Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.
6235	1	a	She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.
6236	1	a	SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.
6237	1	a	2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.

6288	1	a	IMPRESSION:  Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4.
6289	1	a	Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.
6290	1	a	Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.
6291	1	a	My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.
6292	1	a	Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.
6293	1	a	We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.
6294	1	a	Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.
6295	1	a	In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.
6296	1	a	She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.
6297	1	a	Her next appointment is in January.
6298	1	a	HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.
6299	1	a	Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.
6300	1	a	For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her..

6888	1	a	Name:  Mr. Danny Nielson
6889	1	a	MR #:  9156593
6890	1	a	Date of admission: 08/28/2097
6891	1	a	"Admitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD	"
6892	1	a	PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel
6893	1	a	Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note
6894	1	a	Code: Full
6895	1	a	CC:     Want to get my chemo   
6896	1	a	ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.
6897	1	a	HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
6898	1	a	He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.
6899	1	a	He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.
6900	1	a	He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
6901	1	a	Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
6902	1	a	The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.
6903	1	a	PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.
6904	1	a	It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
6905	1	a	The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
6906	1	a	PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
6907	1	a	The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.
6908	1	a	Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.
6909	1	a	Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.
6910	1	a	Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.
6911	1	a	He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
6912	1	a	Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
6913	1	a	He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
6914	1	a	On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.
6915	1	a	He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
6916	1	a	He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
6917	1	a	He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.
6918	1	a	Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

7073	1	a	Re:  Dalila Haynes
7074	1	a	       783-61-34-3
7075	1	a	Dear Dr. Kay: 
7076	1	a	I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
7077	1	a	She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
7078	1	a	I will review her history for the record.
7079	1	a	She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.
7080	1	a	Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
7081	1	a	Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.
7082	1	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
7083	1	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
7084	1	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
7085	1	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
7086	1	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
7087	1	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
7088	1	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
7089	1	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
7090	1	a	CSF ACE was normal.
7091	1	a	Cultures were negative.
7092	1	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
7093	1	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
7094	1	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
7095	1	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
7096	1	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
7097	1	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
7098	1	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
7099	1	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
7100	1	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
7101	1	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
7102	1	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
7103	1	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
7104	1	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
7105	1	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
7106	1	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
7107	1	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
7108	1	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
7109	1	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
7110	1	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
7111	1	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
7112	1	a	There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
7113	1	a	She is a widow.
7114	1	a	She has four children.
7115	1	a	She used to work for Lowe's.
7116	1	a	She now lives with a daughter.
7117	1	a	She has had no recent fever or chills.
7118	1	a	Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
7119	1	a	There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
7120	1	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
7121	1	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
7122	1	a	Pulse 126, regular.
7123	1	a	BP 126/66.
7124	2	a	She is obese.
7125	1	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
7126	1	a	There are no cranial bruits.
7127	1	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
7128	1	a	There are wheezes bilaterally.
7129	1	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
7130	1	a	The abdomen is benign.
7131	1	a	The extremities are normal.
7132	1	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
7133	1	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
7134	1	a	She is oriented to place.
7135	1	a	She is inattentive.
7136	1	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
7137	1	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
7138	1	a	There is no aphasia.
7139	1	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
7140	1	a	The visual fields are full.
7141	1	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
7142	1	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
7143	1	a	.
7144	1	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
7145	1	a	Facial sensation is intact.
7146	1	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
7147	1	a	Hearing is grossly intact.
7148	1	a	Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
7149	1	a	The palate elevates normal.
7150	1	a	Gag is present.
7151	1	a	The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
7152	1	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
7153	1	a	Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.
7154	1	a	There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.
7155	1	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
7156	1	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
7157	1	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
7158	1	a	Coordination is intact.
7159	1	a	Romberg is negative.
7160	1	a	Gait and station are normal.
7161	1	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
7162	1	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
7163	1	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
7164	1	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
7165	1	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
7166	1	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
7167	1	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
7168	1	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
7169	1	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
7170	1	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
7171	1	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
7172	1	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
7173	1	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
7174	1	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
7175	1	a	Thank you for this consultation.
7176	1	a	Sincerely,

7238	1	a	Assessment and plan
7239	1	a	Chest discomfort.
7240	1	a	The patient's history and exam do not suggest cardiovascular origin but pain originated in the chest wall, musculoskeletal in origin.
7241	1	a	She had an ECG in my office that was unchanged from previous ones, there were no ST-TW abnormalities, no extrasystoles or any other abnormality.
7242	1	a	She was reassured.
7243	1	a	For musculoskeletal pain I have recommended stretching exercises, and low dose diazepam for muscle contracture.
7244	1	a	She will avoid NSAID due to GI symptoms.
7245	1	a	Abdominal discomfort with diarrhea.
7246	1	a	The patient will follow a CHO diet and will avoid dairy products and other substances with low-absorption high-residue.
7247	1	a	In addition, in context of weakness I have recommended her to have a chemistry analysis for investigating electrolytes.
7248	1	a	Should symptoms persist then I will recommend the patient to initiate Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.
7249	1	a	Dehydration.
7250	1	a	The patient will initiate a strict fluid replenishment plan for rehydration.

7913	1	a	Dear Dr. Umali:
7914	1	a	Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.
7915	1	a	Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.
7916	1	a	He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.
7917	1	a	He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.
7918	1	a	Review of systems is negative except as above.
7919	1	a	Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.
7920	1	a	Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.
7921	1	a	Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.
7922	2	a	Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.
7923	1	a	BP 169/83 and pulse 58.
7924	1	a	Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.
7925	1	a	Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
7926	1	a	Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
7927	1	a	Extremities:  No edema, warm.
7928	1	a	Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.
7929	1	a	Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.
7930	1	a	Skeletal films are pending.
7931	1	a	Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD.
7932	1	a	Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..
7933	1	a	He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.
7934	1	a	I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.
7935	1	a	I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.
7936	1	a	However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.
7937	1	a	In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.
7938	1	a	He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.
7939	1	a	Thank you for referring this patient.
7940	1	a	Sincerely,

8193	1	a	RE: Michael Ogrady
8194	1	a	       MR #631-90-33-7
8195	1	a	Dear Dr. Patton:
8196	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
8197	1	a	his coronary artery
8198	1	a	disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.
8199	1	a	As you know, this is a 
8200	1	a	63-year-old male with a
8201	1	a	long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 
8202	1	a	peripheral vascular
8203	1	a	disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 
8204	1	a	diagnosed
8205	1	a	esophageal carcinoma.
8206	1	a	He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 
8207	1	a	Landers, for the last nine
8208	1	a	years.
8209	1	a	Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
8210	1	a	artery disease which is
8211	1	a	documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
8212	1	a	The 
8213	1	a	catheterization demonstrated
8214	1	a	right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 
8215	1	a	and a 30%
8216	1	a	marginal 1 lesion.
8217	1	a	There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
8218	1	a	PDA and from the
8219	1	a	septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.
8220	1	a	procedure was
8221	1	a	performed through the right radial artery without complications.
8222	1	a	Patient 
8223	1	a	also has peripheral
8224	1	a	vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
8225	1	a	vein bypass graft in
8226	1	a	2088.
8227	1	a	He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
8228	1	a	femoral to posterior
8229	1	a	tibial graft.
8230	1	a	He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.
8231	1	a	His activity level is 
8232	1	a	limited by his claudication.
8233	1	a	He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 
8234	1	a	treatment.
8235	1	a	At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.
8236	1	a	He gets 
8237	1	a	chest pressure one to
8238	1	a	two times a month.
8239	1	a	However, his activity is extremely limited.
8240	1	a	He reports 
8241	1	a	that he has had a
8242	1	a	positive stress test.
8243	1	a	Further information is not available.
8244	1	a	understands he has coronary
8245	1	a	disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.
8246	1	a	On 
8247	1	a	catheterization he had
8248	1	a	preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
8249	1	a	He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
8250	1	a	after receiving
8251	1	a	chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
8252	1	a	Patient states he will be 
8253	1	a	receiving a Hickman

8255	1	a	Page 2
8256	1	a	March 3, 2093
8257	1	a	catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 
8258	1	a	therapy.
8259	2	a	On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.
8260	1	a	His blood 
8261	1	a	pressure is 100/72,
8262	1	a	heart rate is 57 bpm.
8263	1	a	HEENT: oropharynx benign.
8264	1	a	Neck: carotids intact 
8265	1	a	bilaterally without
8266	1	a	audible bruits.
8267	1	a	Lungs: distant breath sounds.
8268	1	a	Cor: without obvious jugular 
8269	1	a	venous distention.
8270	1	a	Heart sounds distant.
8271	1	a	Normal S1 and S2.
8272	1	a	No appreciable murmurs.
8273	1	a	Abdomen: 
8274	1	a	unable to palpate
8275	1	a	firm masses or aortic aneurysm.
8276	1	a	Bowel sounds present.
8277	1	a	Extremities: status 
8278	1	a	post surgery to the
8279	1	a	left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.
8280	1	a	Distal pulses are absent.
8281	1	a	Neuro: 
8282	1	a	intact.
8283	1	a	EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.
8284	1	a	IMI with age undetermined.
8285	1	a	Nonspecific STT
8286	1	a	wave abnormalities present.
8287	1	a	No previous EKG for comparison.
8288	1	a	Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 
8289	1	a	artery disease and
8290	1	a	peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
8291	1	a	He 
8292	1	a	clearly has ischemia
8293	1	a	on a positive stress test.
8294	1	a	I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
8295	1	a	check ischemic
8296	1	a	threshold.
8297	1	a	He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
8298	1	a	event.
8299	1	a	However, given
8300	1	a	his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 
8301	1	a	surgery even
8302	1	a	understanding possible complications.
8303	1	a	Plan:
8304	1	a	1.
8305	1	a	Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
8306	1	a	2.
8307	1	a	Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
8308	1	a	control of
8309	1	a	     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 
8310	1	a	dobutamine
8311	1	a	     echocardiography.
8312	1	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 
8313	1	a	Ogrady.
8314	1	a	Please do
8315	1	a	not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

8555	1	a	This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
8556	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
8557	2	a	obesity.
8558	1	a	Her problems are as follows:
8559	1	a	1.
8560	1	a	Diabetes.
8561	1	a	She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
8562	1	a	     and she was put on insulin by me.
8563	1	a	Xitlali Xia followed her in 
8564	1	a	     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
8565	1	a	     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.
8566	1	a	She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
8567	1	a	     list of her blood sugars.
8568	1	a	She says she does take them about twice a 
8569	1	a	     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
8570	1	a	     threw them away.
8571	1	a	She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
8572	1	a	     they usually are about 110.
8573	1	a	It was 101 this morning before 
8574	1	a	     breakfast, she says.
8575	1	a	She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
8576	1	a	     six times it has been below 50.
8577	1	a	She does say she eats three regular 
8578	1	a	     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
8579	1	a	     breakfast she said no.
8580	1	a	She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
8581	1	a	I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.
8582	1	a	I expressed to her again how 
8583	1	a	     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.
8584	1	a	She had been eating a lot of chocolate.
8585	1	a	She says she has gotten off 
8586	1	a	     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
8587	1	a	     then.
8588	1	a	She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
8589	1	a	     help her with her diet.
8590	1	a	If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
8591	1	a	     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.
8592	1	a	I explained to her, too, 
8593	1	a	     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
8594	1	a	     be able to get her off the insulin.
8595	1	a	This seemed to be something that 
8596	1	a	     she would like to do.
8597	1	a	Hopefully the nutritionist can help.
8598	1	a	I also 
8599	1	a	     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
8600	1	a	     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
8601	1	a	     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
8602	1	a	     really going on and whether they are getting too low.
8603	1	a	She denies any 
8604	1	a	     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.
8605	1	a	I am 
8606	1	a	     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.
8607	1	a	She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
8608	1	a	     nothing.
8609	1	a	She felt totally normal.
8610	1	a	So hopefully she will really 
8611	1	a	     record these and we will get a better idea.
8612	1	a	She said this always 
8613	1	a	     happens in the morning.
8614	1	a	She kept contradicting herself and had no 
8615	1	a	     documentation.
8616	1	a	I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
8617	1	a	Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.
8618	1	a	She does drink juice, 
8619	1	a	     but I went over the symptoms again with her.
8620	1	a	She will call me if she 
8621	1	a	     does have any.
8622	1	a	10-19-86
8623	1	a	2.
8624	1	a	Left ankle pain.
8625	1	a	I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.
8626	1	a	She said that she may do some surgery on her.
8627	1	a	3.
8628	1	a	Dysuria.
8629	1	a	She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
8630	1	a	     Bactrim.
8631	1	a	4.
8632	1	a	Yeast infection.
8633	1	a	She said this has also resolved.
8634	1	a	5.
8635	1	a	She complains of headache.
8636	1	a	She says these have been going on for two 
8637	1	a	     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.
8638	1	a	She has had nausea and vomited once.
8639	1	a	This happened pretty much every 
8640	1	a	     day and it can be at any time of the day.
8641	1	a	Tylenol and Advil did not 
8642	1	a	     help.
8643	1	a	She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
8644	1	a	     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.
8645	1	a	But she has no further prodrome.
8646	1	a	She says it is a banging kind of 
8647	1	a	     pain that is rhythmic.
8648	1	a	She also says she does see stars in front of 
8649	1	a	     her eyes when it happens.
8650	1	a	I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
8651	1	a	     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
8652	1	a	     sometimes.
8653	1	a	It has been happening for a couple of weeks.
8654	1	a	I discussed 
8655	1	a	     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
8656	1	a	     migraines.
8657	1	a	I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
8658	1	a	     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.
8659	1	a	Her neuro exam 
8660	1	a	     was totally normal.
8661	1	a	Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.
8662	1	a	Her gait was normal.
8663	1	a	Light touch was touched.
8664	1	a	Her toes were 
8665	1	a	     downgoing.
8666	1	a	Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.
8667	1	a	Her disks were 
8668	1	a	     sharp.
8669	1	a	EOMI, PERRL.
8670	1	a	I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
8671	1	a	     t.i.d.
8672	1	a	and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
8673	1	a	     her left ear.
8674	1	a	I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
8675	1	a	6.
8676	1	a	Health maintenance.
8677	1	a	I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
8678	1	a	     that she might benefit from a flu shot.
8679	1	a	She has no interest in this 
8680	1	a	     at all.
8681	1	a	Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
8682	1	a	     cuff.
8683	1	a	Her pulse was 96.
8684	1	a	Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
8685	1	a	     285.

8927	1	a	According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum.
8928	1	a	No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.

9821	1	a	EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE
9822	1	a	I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.
9823	1	a	Forrest.
9824	1	a	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the
9825	1	a	patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's
9826	1	a	chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
9827	1	a	disposition with the patient.
9828	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.
9829	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple
9830	1	a	medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.
9831	1	a	At her
9832	1	a	rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent
9833	1	a	here.
9834	1	a	The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable
9835	1	a	for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent
9836	1	a	hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the
9837	1	a	end of December through the beginning of January.
9838	1	a	The patient's
9839	1	a	chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the
9840	1	a	patient has been doing well at rehab since.
9841	1	a	However, today was
9842	1	a	noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.
9843	1	a	She had
9844	1	a	shortness of breath as well.
9845	1	a	Her oxygen saturations improved
9846	1	a	marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to
9847	1	a	nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.
9848	1	a	The patient was
9849	1	a	treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement
9850	1	a	and is noted to be quite tachypneic.
9851	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,
9852	1	a	diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,
9853	1	a	anemia, and cervical fracture.
9854	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited
9855	1	a	by the severity of the patient's presentation.
9856	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,
9857	1	a	Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,
9858	1	a	Colace, and Xalatan.
9859	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.
9860	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some
9861	1	a	degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and
9862	1	a	answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.
9863	1	a	Vital signs are as
9864	1	a	documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,
9865	1	a	and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.
9866	1	a	HEENT exam is
9867	1	a	atraumatic, normal to inspection.
9868	1	a	The patient has a large tongue
9869	1	a	and her uvula is not visible at all.
9870	1	a	Neck is immobilized in a
9871	2	a	C-collar and is obese.
9872	1	a	Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath
9873	1	a	sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory
9874	1	a	use.
9875	1	a	Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without
9876	1	a	murmur.
9877	1	a	Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.
9878	1	a	Abdomen is
9879	2	a	soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or
9880	1	a	masses, or guarding, or rebound.
9881	1	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry
9882	1	a	without any lesions or rash.
9883	1	a	Musculoskeletal exam reveals
9884	1	a	tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib
9885	1	a	fractures.
9886	1	a	Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty
9887	1	a	speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic
9888	1	a	deficit.
9889	1	a	LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.
9890	1	a	White
9891	1	a	blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is
9892	1	a	at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.
9893	1	a	LFTs within
9894	1	a	normal limit.
9895	1	a	INR 1.2.
9896	1	a	D-dimer significantly elevated.
9897	1	a	EKG
9898	1	a	demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
9899	1	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which
9900	1	a	are present previously but possibly slightly increased.
9901	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given
9902	1	a	Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was
9903	1	a	also started on CPAP.
9904	1	a	She seemed to be improving clinically for
9905	1	a	some period of time but then began to decline in her mental
9906	1	a	status.
9907	1	a	At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.
9908	1	a	Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient
9909	1	a	likely needed intubation.
9910	1	a	We had hope to hold off to do a
9911	1	a	thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines
9912	1	a	such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the
9913	1	a	procedure.
9914	1	a	On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable
9915	1	a	throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory
9916	1	a	distress.
9917	1	a	Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex
9918	1	a	her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful
9919	1	a	in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in
9920	1	a	between those attempts.
9921	1	a	For full details of the procedure,
9922	1	a	please see the attached procedure note.
9923	1	a	Thoracic Surgery was
9924	1	a	consulted.
9925	1	a	They arrived as the patient was being intubated.
9926	1	a	At
9927	1	a	this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to
9928	1	a	determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural
9929	1	a	effusion and whether it is loculated.
9930	1	a	This study will be
9931	1	a	performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in
9932	1	a	the ICU.
9933	1	a	A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and
9934	1	a	the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.
9935	1	a	******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
9936	1	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
9937	1	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.
9938	1	a	TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural
9939	1	a	effusion.
9940	1	a	FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.
9941	1	a	DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.
9942	1	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

9955	1	a	IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. Youngman is a 36 year old woman with the following 
9956	1	a	medical problems: 
9957	1	a	1.
9958	1	a	Type II diabetes mellitus.
9959	1	a	2.

9967	1	a	6.
9968	1	a	GERD.
9969	1	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
9970	1	a	25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
9971	1	a	PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
9972	1	a	PO q.h.s.
9973	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
9974	1	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
9975	1	a	depression.
9976	1	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
9977	1	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
9978	1	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
9979	1	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
9980	1	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
9981	1	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
9982	1	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
9983	1	a	study.
9984	1	a	She is scheduled later this month.
9985	1	a	She has no new complaints, 
9986	1	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
9987	1	a	it over the past two days.
9988	1	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
9989	1	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
9990	1	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
9991	1	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
9992	1	a	the morning.
9993	1	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
9994	1	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
9995	1	a	that she has been taking them.
9996	1	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
9997	1	a	this is true or not.
9998	1	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
9999	1	a	She says 
10000	1	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
10001	1	a	She was recently started on 
10002	1	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
10003	1	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
10004	1	a	a month.
10005	1	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
10006	1	a	She says overall 
10007	1	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
10008	1	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
10009	1	a	We again discussed the 
10010	1	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
10011	1	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
10012	1	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
10013	1	a	frequency.
10014	1	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
10015	1	a	rest.

10017	1	a	Page 2
10018	2	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
10019	1	a	Her 
10020	1	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
10021	1	a	Her weight today is 
10022	1	a	249lb.
10023	1	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.
10024	1	a	Her JVP is not visible at 90 
10025	1	a	degrees.
10026	1	a	There are no carotid bruits.
10027	1	a	Her lungs are clear to 
10028	1	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
10029	1	a	positive S1, S2.
10030	1	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
10031	1	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
10032	1	a	Her finger stick 
10033	1	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
10034	1	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
10035	1	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
10036	1	a	Diabetes.
10037	1	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
10038	1	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
10039	1	a	Finger stick in the 
10040	1	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
10041	1	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
10042	1	a	     over the past couple of months.
10043	1	a	In any event, she most likely need 
10044	1	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
10045	1	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
10046	1	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
10047	1	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
10048	1	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
10049	1	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
10050	1	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
10051	1	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
10052	1	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
10053	1	a	Coronary disease.
10054	1	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
10055	1	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
10056	1	a	as she did have room to go 
10057	1	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
10058	1	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
10059	1	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
10060	1	a	Again, reinforced the 
10061	1	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
10062	1	a	     again as I have in the past.
10063	1	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
10064	1	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
10065	1	a	I told her she should take the 
10066	1	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
10067	1	a	Health maintenance.
10068	1	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
10069	1	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
10070	1	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
10071	1	a	Additionally, I 
10072	1	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
10073	1	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
10074	1	a	I also stressed the

10076	1	a	Page 3
10077	1	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
10078	1	a	She says she is scheduled 
10079	1	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
10080	1	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

10102	2	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55 yr old male with cardiac risk factors of Hypertension, Type II DM, +FH, low HDL, and obesity who was in his USOH until yesterday morning when he developed 3/10 pain across his anterior chest while at rest that he describes as burning in quality with radiation into both jaws and through to his back.
10103	1	a	The pain subsided without intervention after about 30 minutes.
10104	1	a	He remained pain free until this morning when around 6:45 am, he again experienced this burning sensation in the same distribution.

10581	1	a	ONC history - as per prior notes
10582	1	a	3/97: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until he presented with LLE edema and bilateral groin swelling, left>right.
10583	1	a	4/97: CT scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal adenopathy.
10584	1	a	CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.
10585	1	a	The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6.0 cm.
10586	1	a	4/18/97: biopsy of left groin mass c/w DLBCL.
10587	1	a	CD20+, CD 79a+, Pax5+, CD30-, CD15- 
10588	1	a	4/97: PET: Increased FDG uptake throughout the retroperitoneum, left pelvis and proximal left lower extremity which corresponds with extensive lymphadenopathy.
10589	1	a	4/24/97: Bone Marrow Biopsy: without evidence of involvement
10590	1	a	5/01/97 Cycle #1 of CHOP-R at 75% Adria and Cytoxan dose

10769	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 
10770	1	a	for follow up regarding her diabetes.
10771	1	a	Since I last saw her, she 
10772	1	a	has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 
10773	1	a	October.
10774	1	a	Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 
10775	1	a	repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 
10776	1	a	essentially within normal limits.
10777	1	a	She denies any recurrent flank 
10778	1	a	pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.
10779	1	a	Says overall she is feeling 
10780	1	a	relatively well.
10781	1	a	She is taking all of her medications as 
10782	1	a	prescribed.
10783	1	a	She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 
10784	1	a	fatigue, or blurry vision.
10785	1	a	She continues to smoke.
10786	1	a	She has not 
10787	1	a	been exercising.
10788	1	a	She also continues to have intermittent chest 
10789	1	a	pain of unclear etiology.
10790	1	a	Several days ago, she had an episode 
10791	1	a	that lasted a minute or two at rest.
10792	1	a	She described it as a 
10793	1	a	tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 
10794	1	a	nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.
10795	1	a	She has 
10796	1	a	no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 
10797	1	a	symptoms in the past few days.
10798	1	a	She has not been taking her blood 
10799	1	a	sugars at home as her machine is broken.
10800	1	a	Also, she self-
10801	1	a	discontinued her lisinopril.
10802	1	a	She thought it gave her a headache.
10803	1	a	Page 2
10804	2	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 
10805	1	a	distress.
10806	1	a	Pulse 68 and regular.
10807	1	a	Blood pressure 134/84 and 
10808	1	a	weight 226.
10809	1	a	Fingerstick today 198.
10810	1	a	Neck veins are non-elevated.
10811	1	a	No carotid bruits.
10812	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
10813	1	a	Lungs are clear to 
10814	1	a	auscultation bilaterally.
10815	1	a	Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.
10816	1	a	Normal S1 and S2.
10817	1	a	No murmurs.
10818	1	a	Extremities are warm and without 
10819	1	a	edema.
10820	1	a	Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 
10821	1	a	vibration and light touch.
10822	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 
10823	1	a	normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-
10824	1	a	waves.
10825	1	a	Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
10826	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
10827	1	a	problems as follows:
10828	1	a	Type 2 diabetes.
10829	1	a	Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
10830	1	a	the 9.0.
10831	1	a	She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
10832	1	a	try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
10833	1	a	At this point, it 
10834	1	a	is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
10835	1	a	regimen starting with b.i.d.
10836	1	a	NPH, and we will refer her to the 
10837	1	a	diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 
10838	1	a	with a plan to transition her at that time.
10839	1	a	Her urine 
10840	1	a	microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
10841	1	a	We will recheck 
10842	1	a	her hemoglobin A1c today.
10843	1	a	She has been to the ophthalmologist 
10844	1	a	recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
10845	1	a	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 
10846	1	a	pain is somewhat concerning.
10847	1	a	She does have coronary disease 
10848	1	a	as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
10849	1	a	She is taking an 
10850	1	a	aspirin and a beta-blocker.
10851	1	a	Her EKG today is normal, and she 
10852	1	a	has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
10853	1	a	exertion.
10854	1	a	Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 
10855	1	a	pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
10856	1	a	the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 
10857	1	a	and beta-blocker.
10858	1	a	I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
10859	1	a	ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
10860	1	a	referring her to Cardiology.

10862	1	a	"	11/24/94"
10863	1	a	"	Page 3"
10864	1	a	"	"
10865	1	a	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 
10866	1	a	prefer better blood pressure control.
10867	1	a	She agreed to try the 
10868	1	a	lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 
10869	1	a	thinks it disagrees with her.
10870	1	a	I told her I felt the headache 
10871	1	a	was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
10872	1	a	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 
10873	1	a	I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 
10874	1	a	today without receiving one.
10875	1	a	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

10907	1	a	RE:  Roberta Vincent
10908	1	a	     MR #380-18-32-2
10909	1	a	Dear Dr. Long:
10910	1	a	Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.
10911	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
10912	1	a	2092.
10913	1	a	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
10914	1	a	Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
10915	1	a	failure of unknown etiology.
10916	1	a	She is six years status post
10917	1	a	hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
10918	1	a	leiomyosarcoma was discovered.
10919	1	a	She has an extensive history of
10920	2	a	hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.
10921	1	a	She had one stillborn
10922	1	a	infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions.
10923	1	a	SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
10924	1	a	Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
10925	1	a	furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
10926	1	a	Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
10927	1	a	250 mg qid.
10928	1	a	On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
10929	1	a	distress.
10930	1	a	Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.
10931	1	a	Temperature
10932	1	a	is normal.
10933	1	a	Pulse is 88 beats per minute.
10934	1	a	Blood pressure is
10935	1	a	178/96.
10936	1	a	There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.
10937	1	a	There is a
10938	1	a	buffalo hump.
10939	1	a	The lungs show scattered wheezing.
10940	1	a	Cardiovascular
10941	1	a	exam is normal.
10942	1	a	There are discolorations of the skin across the
10943	1	a	neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
10944	1	a	raised.
10945	2	a	The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.
10946	1	a	ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.
10947	1	a	The
10948	1	a	extremities show trace edema.
10949	1	a	There are several areas of
10950	1	a	superficial petechiae.
10951	1	a	In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
10952	1	a	unclear etiology.
10953	1	a	She does report an episode of lower extremity
10954	1	a	swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.
10955	1	a	ThisRoberta Vincent
10956	1	a	MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
10957	1	a	raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
10958	1	a	in a chronic phase.
10959	1	a	Other diagnostic possibilities include other
10960	1	a	forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
10961	1	a	erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions.
10962	1	a	Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
10963	1	a	time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
10964	1	a	risk due to her body habitus.
10965	1	a	I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
10966	1	a	Vincent.
10967	1	a	Although she has no medical conditions which would
10968	1	a	preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
10969	2	a	obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
10970	1	a	hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.
10971	1	a	I have
10972	1	a	encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
10973	1	a	order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
10974	1	a	transplantation.
10975	1	a	Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
10976	1	a	of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
10977	1	a	been performed previously.
10978	1	a	I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
10979	1	a	kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
10980	1	a	meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
10981	1	a	fistula or placement of a graft.
10982	1	a	Thank you once again for your kind referral.

10996	1	a	 Medicine Admission Note
10997	1	a	Patient Name:  Fay, Brook
10998	1	a	MRN: 11289501
10999	1	a	Date: 9/16/96
11000	1	a	Admitting Staff: Tellez
11001	1	a	Location:  59H
11002	1	a	Reason for Admission:  Dysphagia
11003	1	a	HPI: Ms. Fay is a 69 year-old woman with diabetes who presented from home with an approximately 2 month history of progressive dysphagia, solid and liquid.
11004	1	a	About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling.
11005	1	a	The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone.
11006	1	a	She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery.
11007	1	a	Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well.
11008	1	a	No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel.
11009	1	a	She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.
11010	1	a	In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
11011	1	a	She was evaluated by the GI department.
11012	1	a	A screening HIV test was negative.
11013	1	a	She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes.
11014	1	a	The above findings prompted admission for further workup.
11015	1	a	ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives above.

11041	1	a	HEENT:  Conjunctivae clear, anicteric, NP clear, OP with mild thrush, upper dentures; no sinus tenderness
11042	1	a	Neck:  Supple, no adenopathy; no palpable thyromegaly
11043	1	a	Heart: RRR, s1s2 without murmur
11044	1	a	Lungs: CTA bilaterally without wheeze/rales

11054	1	a	UA: 3+ glucose, otherwise negative
11055	1	a	MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture pending
11056	1	a	RADIOLOGY: None
11057	1	a	ECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG
11058	1	a	IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
11059	1	a	The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia.
11060	1	a	Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out.
11061	1	a	The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable.
11062	1	a	Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms.
11063	1	a	ECG warrants following.
11064	1	a	Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.
11065	1	a	CV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker
11066	1	a	Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn
11067	1	a	GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi
11068	1	a	Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted.
11069	1	a	Check HbA1c, TFTs
11070	1	a	FEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet
11071	1	a	Infectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection
11072	1	a	PPx: Enoxaparin may be started after EGD
11073	1	a	Social work consult to assess support network and assist with discharge planning
11074	1	a	Terry Iyer will assume care in the morning.
11075	1	a	Please page Dr. Iyer directly at 00450 with questions arising after 8:00am.

11130	1	a	68 yo pleasant white woman with the following problems:
11131	1	a	1.
11132	1	a	Left vertebral stenosis
11133	1	a	Ms. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness in 2083 and was found to have an infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

11208	1	a	She is therapeutic on her coumadin.
11209	1	a	She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).
11210	1	a	Hypertension:  Patient is quite hypertensive (170/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd.
11211	1	a	Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd.
11212	1	a	She does not complain of any side effects from her medications.
11213	1	a	She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.
11214	1	a	Diabetes Mellitus
11215	1	a	Ms. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home.
11216	1	a	She has had a little polydipsia/polyuria.
11217	1	a	Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level.
11218	1	a	Her UA today is negative and I will check a spot urine microalbumin/Cr ratio.
11219	1	a	On her next visit I will schedule an ophthalmology appointment.

11226	1	a	I have instructed her in self-examination.
11227	1	a	Ms. Ordonez' skin lesion looks like it may be a suborrheic keratosis or squamous cell.
11228	1	a	I will refer to a dermatologist.
11229	1	a	7.
11230	1	a	Health maintenance
11231	1	a	I discussed both hormone replacement therapy and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy with Ms. Ordonez and she has declined both.
11232	1	a	She also does not want a pneumovax today, although she is willing to have her tetanus.
11233	1	a	She has also agreed to start taking calcium/vitamin D as well as an MVI.
11234	1	a	She has had recent mammography.
11235	1	a	Follow-up:  I will see Ms. Ordonez in one month to check her blood pressure on her increased dose of Atenolol.

11313	1	a	CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks
11314	1	a	HPI:  
11315	1	a	Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.
11316	1	a	Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.
11317	1	a	He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.
11318	1	a	This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.
11319	1	a	He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits.
11320	1	a	He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.
11321	1	a	No new incontinence.
11322	1	a	This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.
11323	1	a	ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative.
11324	1	a	CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.
11325	1	a	Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
11326	1	a	LP was negative.
11327	1	a	Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro/psych consult.

11394	1	a	Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.
11395	1	a	Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.

11400	1	a	Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.
11401	1	a	Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.
11402	1	a	EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny.
11403	1	a	Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.
11404	1	a	ASSESSMENT & PLAN
11405	1	a	87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.
11406	1	a	The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
11407	1	a	Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.
11408	1	a	Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
11409	1	a	However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.
11410	1	a	Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
11411	1	a	As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
11412	1	a	LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
11413	1	a	One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.
11414	1	a	A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
11415	1	a	Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly.
11416	1	a	However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
11417	1	a	Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative.
11418	1	a	CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
11419	1	a	Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
11420	1	a	will d/w attending
11421	1	a	consider psychiatric consult
11422	1	a	Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
11423	1	a	Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH
11424	1	a	H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.
11425	1	a	NIDDM: Will start RISS
11426	1	a	Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD
11427	1	a	HTN: metoprolol
11428	1	a	Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.
11429	1	a	Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

11716	1	a	No seizure activity.
11717	1	a	He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month.

11740	1	a	He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him.
11741	1	a	He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead.
11742	1	a	He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.

11749	1	a	He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention.

12309	1	a	As per pt, she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already.
12310	1	a	Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview-Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w/u here.
12311	1	a	Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis, EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD, brain imaging to r/o CNS process.
12312	1	a	Can continue to try Reglan 10mg up to QID.
12313	1	a	Will staff with Dr. Otis Aguilera later today.

12437	1	a	Vascular studies done today, OSH: 
12438	1	a	patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft with markedly reduced flow, toe-brachial index 0.0 &#8211; confirmed with PVR in UMH ED
12439	1	a	Assessment/Plan:
12440	1	a	The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.
12441	1	a	His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis.
12442	1	a	He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.
12443	1	a	Plan:
12444	1	a	-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr
12445	1	a	-          Home meds
12446	1	a	-          NPO past midnight
12447	1	a	-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99
12448	1	a	-          Plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05
12449	1	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Francis Pratt, Vascular Surgery Fellow.

12461	1	a	"Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU"
12462	1	a	CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management
12463	1	a	HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.
12464	1	a	He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.
12465	1	a	He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.
12466	1	a	He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.
12467	1	a	He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.
12468	1	a	He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.
12469	1	a	Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.
12470	1	a	On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.
12471	1	a	On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.
12472	1	a	In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.
12473	1	a	On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.
12474	1	a	His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.
12475	1	a	An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.
12476	1	a	The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.
12477	1	a	He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.
12478	1	a	In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.
12479	1	a	"At the time he was feeling ""lousy,"" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376."
12480	1	a	Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.
12481	1	a	He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.
12482	1	a	Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).
12483	1	a	He has microalbuminuria.
12484	1	a	He is unable to give me a full history.
12485	1	a	In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.
12486	1	a	He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

12568	1	a	Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.
12569	1	a	Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.
12570	1	a	Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.
12571	1	a	Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.
12572	1	a	Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.
12573	1	a	Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.
12574	1	a	Recommend:
12575	1	a	Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
12576	1	a	Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
12577	1	a	Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
12578	1	a	Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g.
12579	1	a	Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
12580	1	a	Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves
12581	1	a	Thank you for interesting consult

12597	1	a	He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD.
12598	1	a	However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox.
12599	1	a	Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic.
12600	1	a	He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement.
12601	1	a	After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8/10.

12813	1	a	HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
12814	1	a	who presents for routine follow up.
12815	1	a	CURRENT ISSUES:
12816	1	a	1.
12817	1	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
12818	1	a	The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
12819	1	a	     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.
12820	1	a	We discussed 
12821	1	a	     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
12822	1	a	     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
12823	1	a	     tighter control.
12824	1	a	He states he has been following his finger 
12825	1	a	     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this.
12826	1	a	His 
12827	1	a	     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
12828	1	a	     regular.
12829	1	a	At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
12830	1	a	     regular at dinnertime.
12831	1	a	He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
12832	1	a	2.
12833	1	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
12834	1	a	Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
12835	1	a	     rash to his simvastatin.
12836	1	a	This resolved on the discontinuation of 
12837	1	a	     the simvastatin.
12838	1	a	Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
12839	1	a	     January, 2067.
12840	1	a	He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
12841	1	a	     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
12842	1	a	     fats.
12843	1	a	3.
12844	1	a	Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
12845	1	a	The 
12846	1	a	     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
12847	1	a	     Jobst stocking.
12848	1	a	He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
12849	1	a	     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
12850	1	a	     compliant with the stocking.
12851	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.
12852	1	a	Heart rate:  76.
12853	1	a	Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.
12854	1	a	Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
12855	1	a	rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
12856	1	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
12857	2	a	Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.
12858	1	a	Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.
12859	1	a	There is 1+ pedal edema of 
12860	1	a	the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.
12861	1	a	Foot 
12862	1	a	care remains excellent.
12863	1	a	IMPRESSION:                         
12864	1	a	We will increase the patient's 
12865	1	a	     morning NPH dose to 40 units.
12866	1	a	He will once again try to become 
12867	1	a	     more compliant with his diet.
12868	1	a	He will be scheduled for a follow up 
12869	1	a	     ophthalmologic examination.
12870	1	a	We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
12871	1	a	     his recent rash to simvastin.
12872	1	a	We will re-check a fasting lipid 
12873	1	a	     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

12877	1	a	We will once again schedule a follow 
12878	1	a	     up examination with the dietician as well as the ophthalmologist.
12879	1	a	He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the 
12880	1	a	     clinic in approximately one to two months.

13017	1	a	Annual physical, preventative maintenance.
13018	1	a	The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.
13019	1	a	I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.
13020	1	a	Immunizations are up-to-date.
13021	1	a	He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.
13022	1	a	His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.
13023	1	a	We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.
13024	1	a	Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.
13025	1	a	The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.
13026	1	a	We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.
13027	1	a	2.
13028	1	a	Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
13029	1	a	The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.
13030	1	a	Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.
13031	1	a	I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.
13032	1	a	We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.
13033	1	a	I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.
13034	1	a	3.
13035	2	a	Obesity.
13036	1	a	We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.
13037	1	a	I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.
13038	1	a	4.
13039	1	a	CAD with history of DVT.
13040	1	a	He has had an ICD interrogated recently.
13041	1	a	We will check a lipid panel today.
13042	1	a	We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.

13169	1	a	This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.
13170	1	a	His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.
13171	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.
13172	1	a	She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.
13173	1	a	This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.
13174	1	a	She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.
13175	1	a	She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.
13176	1	a	She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.
13177	1	a	She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.
13178	1	a	She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.
13179	1	a	At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.
13180	1	a	She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.
13181	2	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.
13182	1	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
13183	1	a	Her carotids are 2+.
13184	1	a	Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.
13185	1	a	There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
13186	1	a	Lungs are clear.
13187	1	a	Abdomen is benign.
13188	1	a	Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.
13189	1	a	Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.
13190	1	a	There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
13191	1	a	ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.
13192	1	a	After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.
13193	1	a	She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.
13194	1	a	She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

13441	1	a	Recommendation
13442	1	a	1.
13443	1	a	Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.
13444	1	a	2.
13445	1	a	Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).
13446	1	a	Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.
13447	1	a	3.
13448	1	a	Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.
13449	1	a	This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.
13450	1	a	4.
13451	1	a	He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.
13452	1	a	Thank you.

13755	1	a	For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible.
13756	1	a	As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27.
13757	1	a	Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy.
13758	1	a	On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
13759	1	a	The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed.
13760	1	a	After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

13904	1	a	Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.
13905	1	a	Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.
13906	1	a	For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.
13907	1	a	His LDL is markedly elevated.
13908	1	a	My target LDL would be below 70.
13909	1	a	For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.

14297	1	a	"	Reason for visit:"
14298	1	a	   The patient is a 61 yo Equadorian male admitted for cardiac cath after an episode of chest pain with?
14299	1	a	positive markers.
14300	1	a	Interval History:
14301	1	a	   The  patient was  transferred to OGH in 3/2067 because of chest pain with positive markers and aaaanterolateral T wave changes.At which time he was diagnosed with possible ETOH myocarditis.
14302	1	a	His EF was 34%.
14303	1	a	He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion.
14304	1	a	RCA was dominant and patent.
14305	1	a	The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use.
14306	1	a	His EF improved to 66 %.
14307	1	a	He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..
14308	1	a	Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager .
14309	1	a	This is usually relieved with one TNG.
14310	1	a	Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI.
14311	1	a	He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing.
14312	1	a	Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication.
14313	1	a	"While in his jail cell,""resting"" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing."
14314	1	a	There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness.
14315	1	a	He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated.
14316	1	a	He received one sl TNG.
14317	1	a	An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays.
14318	1	a	His pain diminished.
14319	1	a	His BP was 176/100 at the time.
14320	1	a	"He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have ""high lateral changes"" on his EKG's."
14321	1	a	"Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a ""gray zone"" for the hospitals range  for MI."
14322	1	a	The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine.
14323	1	a	While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch.
14324	1	a	He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants.
14325	1	a	He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful.
14326	1	a	His recent arrest made hiite despondent.
14327	1	a	At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox.
14328	1	a	He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea.
14329	1	a	He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.

14405	1	a	RE: Otis Narvaez
14406	1	a	        MR   #04561326
14407	1	a	Dear Dr. Huynh:
14408	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 
14409	1	a	consultation.
14410	1	a	As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 
14411	2	a	of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
14412	1	a	Recently, he underwent 
14413	1	a	evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 
14414	1	a	dobutamine stress echocardiography.
14415	1	a	The echocardiogram revealed reduced 
14416	1	a	left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.
14417	1	a	There was no evidence of ischemia.
14418	1	a	He subsequently underwent coronary 
14419	1	a	catheterization.
14420	1	a	I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 
14421	1	a	told that he had no arterial blockages.
14422	1	a	Symptomatically, he is 
14423	1	a	significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.
14424	1	a	He has attributed 
14425	1	a	this to his weight.
14426	1	a	He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 
14427	1	a	although he has not been taking either of these medications.
14428	1	a	Prior to 
14429	1	a	his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 
14430	1	a	upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.
14431	1	a	This was confirmed 
14432	1	a	subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 
14433	1	a	lung malignancy.
14434	1	a	He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 
14435	1	a	you.
14436	1	a	His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 
14437	2	a	back pain, and obesity.
14438	1	a	Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 
14439	1	a	q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.
14440	1	a	No drug allergies
14441	1	a	Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.
14442	1	a	Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.
14443	1	a	He smoked for 
14444	1	a	40 years but quit approximately three years ago.
14445	1	a	He drinks rarely, 
14446	1	a	although drank heavily in the past.
14447	1	a	       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 
14448	1	a	December 30,  2072                                         
14449	1	a	Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.
14450	1	a	He denies 
14451	1	a	gastrointestinal complaints.
14452	2	a	On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 
14453	1	a	140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.
14454	1	a	HEENT is unremarkable, neck 
14455	1	a	supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 
14456	1	a	without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 
14457	1	a	regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 
14458	1	a	murmurs or rubs.
14459	1	a	Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 
14460	1	a	CVA tenderness.
14461	1	a	No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
14462	1	a	Pulses full.
14463	1	a	Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 
14464	1	a	function by echocardiogram.
14465	1	a	By report he has no evidence of coronary 
14466	1	a	artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.
14467	1	a	If indeed 
14468	1	a	it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 
14469	1	a	this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 
14470	1	a	his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.
14471	1	a	In any case, this 
14472	1	a	puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 
14473	1	a	than if he had significant coronary disease.
14474	1	a	I see no reason why you 
14475	1	a	should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.
14476	1	a	Prior 
14477	1	a	to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.
14478	1	a	I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 
14479	1	a	to South Side Hospital.
14480	1	a	Sincerely yours,
14481	1	a	Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.
