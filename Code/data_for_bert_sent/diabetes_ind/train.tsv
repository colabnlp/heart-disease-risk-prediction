378	1	a	Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.
379	1	a	Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.
380	1	a	For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.
381	1	a	His LDL is markedly elevated.
382	1	a	My target LDL would be below 70.
383	1	a	For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.

402	1	a	Conner, Andrew
403	1	a	MR #9911852
404	1	a	May 18, 2071
405	1	a	Andy comes in for followup of hospitalization on May 6, for coronary artery disease and he had
406	1	a	increasing angina pectoris leading to catheterization.
407	1	a	He underwent angioplasty of the
408	1	a	circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD.
409	1	a	The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stent
410	1	a	versus a plain stent.
411	1	a	This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.
412	1	a	Since then he has been
413	1	a	tired, otherwise felt well.
414	1	a	He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.
415	1	a	His blood sugars
416	1	a	have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.
417	1	a	He is overweight and does not do any
418	1	a	regular exercise program.
419	1	a	He is on        for arthritis.
420	1	a	His current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10
421	1	a	mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg per
422	1	a	day, Flomax .4 and Zestril.
423	1	a	He feels well.
424	1	a	He is a little fatigued.
425	1	a	No obvious angina.
426	1	a	His blood
427	1	a	pressure is running 110/70, his pulse is running 60 and regular.
428	1	a	JVP is normal.
429	1	a	Carotids are
430	1	a	normal.
431	1	a	The lungs are clear.
432	1	a	Coronary:  S3.
433	1	a	IMPRESSION:  Doing well.
434	1	a	I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on low
435	1	a	lipids and I also think that he would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation.
436	1	a	He will also pay close
437	3	a	attention to diabetes and he is prepared to move on with insulin.

498	1	a	PATIENT/PHYSICIAN  He has wanted to see Dr. Jaimes in Cardiology.
499	1	a	I explained to him that I am a cardiologist as well and that I have found in the past it does not work out well to have two cardiologists involved in his care.
500	1	a	I think Dr. Jaimes is a superb cardiologist and I gave him the number for GCH teleservices to find himself a new internist.
501	1	a	He clearly is somewhat conflicted about this and will think about it.

591	1	a	Pt is 76 yo F with h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, many pack-years of smoking, and anxiety who presents with c/o SOB.
592	1	a	Pt was in her usual state of health about 1 week PTA, when she noticed gradually worsening SOB and developing cough productive of scant whitish sputum.
593	1	a	She had no fevers/chills, prior URI symptoms/sick contacts, CP/lightheadedness, N/V/abdominal pain, diaphoresis, increasing leg swelling, or orthopnea/PND symptoms.
594	1	a	She thought she might be developing    bronchitis,    discontinued smoking and called her PCP to ask for antibiotics.
595	1	a	She was told to come to the clinic but her SOB progressively worsened in the few hours PTA, and she called for EMS to go to the ED.
596	1	a	In ED:  
597	1	a	a. Lasix 40 mg IV x2, NTG paste    initial SOB improvement, small UO;
598	1	a	b. Lasix 40 mg IV x 2    improved, ready for floor transfer but develops an episode of worsening SOB/flush pulmonary edema on CXR;
599	1	a	c. Lasix 160mg IV    Morphine 3mg IV + CPAP    Atrovent/Albuterol    Zaroxylin 5mg + Lasix 200mg IV     improved, on Hi-Flow O2; total UO: 1,100cc.

1213	1	a	I also interviewed and examined the patient.
1214	1	a	Please see the note for more details.
1215	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with
1216	3	a	a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2
1217	1	a	weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with
1218	1	a	stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.
1219	1	a	The
1220	1	a	patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this
1221	1	a	ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest
1222	1	a	discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous
1223	1	a	episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with
1224	1	a	activity.
1225	1	a	He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented
1226	1	a	for further evaluation and treatment.
1227	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and
1228	1	a	Altace.
1229	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,
1230	1	a	chest pain free.
1231	1	a	Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,
1232	1	a	and O2 saturation 98% on room air.
1233	1	a	His lungs are clear to

1235	1	a	Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
1236	1	a	Abdomen is soft

1241	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right
1242	1	a	bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic
1243	1	a	changes.
1244	1	a	IV access was established.
1245	1	a	Labs were sent revealing
1246	1	a	essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.
1247	1	a	Initial troponin was
1248	1	a	less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was
1249	1	a	normal.
1250	1	a	The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival.
1251	1	a	Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional
1252	1	a	beta-blockade was given to the patient.
1253	1	a	However, based on his
1254	1	a	story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given
1255	1	a	Lovenox in the emergency room.
1256	1	a	I spoke to the Cardiology B
1257	1	a	attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his
1258	1	a	service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future.
1259	1	a	With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a
1260	1	a	diagnosis of unstable angina.
1261	1	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

1279	1	a	RE:  Michael Isenberg
1280	1	a	HCC# - 367-41-93
1281	1	a	Dear Dr. Uher:
1282	1	a	I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.
1283	3	a	As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.
1284	1	a	He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.
1285	1	a	He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.
1286	1	a	Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.
1287	1	a	He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.
1288	1	a	I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.
1289	1	a	On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.
1290	1	a	His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.
1291	1	a	His lungs were clear bilaterally.
1292	1	a	He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.
1293	1	a	His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.
1294	1	a	Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.
1295	1	a	I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.
1296	1	a	If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.
1297	1	a	Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.
1298	1	a	Sincerely,

1318	1	a	As per d/c summary, he received cefepime for E. coli and VRE UTI (though this is a little confusing since urine culture negative that admission, and positive for these organisms in 11/2097).
1319	1	a	During most recent admission he was found to be C. diff positive, but appears to have had incomplete course of Flagyl.
1320	1	a	Since discharge, patient reports    not feeling the same.

1340	1	a	ONC history - as per prior notes
1341	1	a	3/97: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until he presented with LLE edema and bilateral groin swelling, left>right.
1342	1	a	4/97: CT scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal adenopathy.
1343	1	a	CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.
1344	1	a	The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6.0 cm.
1345	1	a	4/18/97: biopsy of left groin mass c/w DLBCL.
1346	1	a	CD20+, CD 79a+, Pax5+, CD30-, CD15- 
1347	1	a	4/97: PET: Increased FDG uptake throughout the retroperitoneum, left pelvis and proximal left lower extremity which corresponds with extensive lymphadenopathy.
1348	1	a	4/24/97: Bone Marrow Biopsy: without evidence of involvement
1349	1	a	5/01/97 Cycle #1 of CHOP-R at 75% Adria and Cytoxan dose
1350	1	a	5/22/97 Cycle #2 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta
1351	1	a	6/5/97: PET: Interval enlargement of left groin mass but less intense FDG uptake.
1352	1	a	Enlargement in size may represent necrosis from treatment effect.
1353	1	a	Improvement in left iliac adenopathy and resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
1354	1	a	Small pancreatic body cystic lesion - may be IPMT.

1498	1	a	He denies focal wekness.
1499	1	a	He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.
1500	1	a	He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie.
1501	1	a	He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction.
1502	3	a	His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.
1503	1	a	He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.
1504	1	a	Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.
1505	1	a	He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite.

1547	1	a	Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature.
1548	1	a	The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.
1549	1	a	He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow.
1550	1	a	They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process.
1551	1	a	He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM.
1552	1	a	We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out.
1553	1	a	Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.
1554	1	a	In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically.
1555	1	a	Is any of this TB?
1556	1	a	Recommend:
1557	1	a	-- skeletal survey
1558	1	a	-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas
1559	1	a	-- beta-2 microglobulin
1560	1	a	-- reticulocyte count
1561	1	a	-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco
1562	1	a	-- guaiac all stools
1563	1	a	-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential
1564	1	a	-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today.
1565	1	a	-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.
1566	1	a	Thank you for this consult.

1576	1	a	Reason for visit:  Patient is a 59 year old woman seen today together with Dr. Barajas.
1577	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 50 mg q.d., Zestril 20 mg q.d.
1578	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 150/80 with a pulse of 76.
1579	1	a	PLAN:  
1580	1	a	1.
1581	1	a	I would increase her atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the late afternoon.

1583	3	a	Diabetes is in suboptimal control, despite maximum dose Micronase.
1584	1	a	Creatinine of 1.4 would argue against using Glucophage.
1585	1	a	Check hemoglobin A1C and then we will decide on her medication.

1597	1	a	For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible.
1598	1	a	As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27.
1599	1	a	Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy.
1600	1	a	On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
1601	1	a	The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed.
1602	1	a	After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

1684	1	a	After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.
1685	1	a	He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent.
1686	1	a	He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen.
1687	1	a	He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent.
1688	1	a	He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.
1689	1	a	The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.
1690	1	a	He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.
1691	1	a	He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.

1765	3	a	Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
1766	1	a	comes in for a physical.
1767	1	a	She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's.
1768	1	a	She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and

1821	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.
1822	1	a	She has not had a recent tetanus shot.
1823	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress.
1824	1	a	Her blood
1825	1	a	pressure here is 150/90.
1826	1	a	Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
1827	1	a	Lungs are clear
1828	1	a	without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
1829	1	a	Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy.
1830	1	a	Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or
1831	1	a	murmur.
1832	1	a	Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
1833	1	a	She is
1834	1	a	moderately obese.
1835	1	a	Her rectal exam is without masses.
1836	1	a	She has no spinal tenderness
1837	1	a	on palpation.
1838	1	a	Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.
1839	1	a	She does not have any peripheral
1840	1	a	edema.
1841	1	a	Her distal pulses are 2+.
1842	1	a	Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.
1843	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1844	1	a	(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.
1845	1	a	This is probably due to her
1846	1	a	     spinal stenosis.
1847	3	a	However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
1848	1	a	     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
1849	1	a	We will check lower extremity noninvasive
1850	1	a	     arterial studies to rule out claudication.
1851	1	a	She can take the Vioxx p.r.n.
1852	1	a	for her
1853	1	a	     foot pain which I do not think is related.
1854	3	a	(2)  Type 2 diabetes.
1855	1	a	She needs a hemoglobin A1c.
1856	1	a	Her blood pressure ideally
1857	1	a	     should be under 130/85.
1858	1	a	She reports that it is consistently below that level
1859	1	a	     when her daughter checks it.
1860	1	a	She needs as chem-7.
1861	1	a	She has no evidence for

1983	1	a	Reason for consult: Acute on chronic renal failure
1984	3	a	HPI: 65 y/o man with PMH of stage IV CKD, HTN, CAD, RAS, DM, who was admitted to the CCU on 1/26 after an episode of bradycardia and PEA arrest at home.
1985	1	a	Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB.
1986	1	a	She called EMS.
1987	1	a	Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s.
1988	1	a	He was intubated.
1989	1	a	He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse.
1990	1	a	In the ED, his BP was 230/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt.
1991	1	a	He was noted to have blood in his OG tube.
1992	1	a	CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
1993	1	a	Chest CT showed multiple rib fractures with substernal hematoma and bilateral modest pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis vs consolidations.
1994	1	a	On admission, pt&#8217;s BUN and creatinine were 43 and 4.35, respectively.
1995	1	a	He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis without a good response.
1996	1	a	His Cr started to rise: 4.6 &#224; 4.9 &#224; 5.4 &#224; 5.33 &#224; 6.3 &#224; 7.0.
1997	1	a	His urine output continued to be poor, and renal consult was called.

2133	1	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
2134	1	a	25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
2135	1	a	PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
2136	1	a	PO q.h.s.
2137	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
2138	3	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
2139	1	a	depression.
2140	1	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
2141	1	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
2142	1	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
2143	1	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
2144	1	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
2145	1	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
2146	1	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
2147	1	a	study.
2148	1	a	She is scheduled later this month.
2149	1	a	She has no new complaints, 
2150	1	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
2151	1	a	it over the past two days.
2152	1	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
2153	1	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
2154	1	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
2155	1	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
2156	1	a	the morning.
2157	1	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
2158	1	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
2159	1	a	that she has been taking them.
2160	1	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
2161	1	a	this is true or not.
2162	1	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
2163	1	a	She says 
2164	1	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
2165	1	a	She was recently started on 
2166	1	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
2167	1	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
2168	1	a	a month.
2169	1	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
2170	1	a	She says overall 
2171	1	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
2172	1	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
2173	1	a	We again discussed the 
2174	1	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
2175	1	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
2176	1	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
2177	1	a	frequency.
2178	1	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
2179	1	a	rest.

2181	1	a	Page 2
2182	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
2183	1	a	Her 
2184	1	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
2185	1	a	Her weight today is 
2186	1	a	249lb.
2187	1	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.
2188	1	a	Her JVP is not visible at 90 
2189	1	a	degrees.
2190	1	a	There are no carotid bruits.
2191	1	a	Her lungs are clear to 
2192	1	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
2193	1	a	positive S1, S2.
2194	1	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
2195	1	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
2196	1	a	Her finger stick 
2197	1	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
2198	1	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
2199	1	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
2200	1	a	Diabetes.
2201	0	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
2202	1	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
2203	1	a	Finger stick in the 
2204	1	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
2205	1	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
2206	1	a	     over the past couple of months.
2207	1	a	In any event, she most likely need 
2208	1	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
2209	1	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
2210	1	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
2211	1	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
2212	1	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
2213	1	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
2214	1	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
2215	1	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on

2305	1	a	We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1.
2306	1	a	Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD.
2307	1	a	Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions.
2308	1	a	Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2.
2309	1	a	new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol.
2310	1	a	She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control.
2311	1	a	She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls.
2312	1	a	She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3.
2313	1	a	Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77).
2314	1	a	However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia.
2315	1	a	Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan.
2316	1	a	This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability.
2317	1	a	Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult.
2318	1	a	We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412

2536	3	a	Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF exacerbation from right sided failure.
2537	1	a	Appears to have class IV disease with symptoms at rest.
2538	1	a	BNP is elevated from baseline (584) at 1625 confirming acute exacerbation.
2539	1	a	Exacerbation may be from increased Na intake, medicine non-compliance and increased po fluid intake, could also be from anemia.
2540	1	a	##: CHF exacerbation &#8211; patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix with UOP of 1 L
2541	1	a	Lasix 40mg IV BID titrate to TBB goal of at least -1 L (will likely require more as patient required 80 mg IV TID last admission for CHF)

2572	3	a	HPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
2573	1	a	She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.
2574	1	a	She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.
2575	1	a	All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.
2576	1	a	She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.
2577	1	a	She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.
2578	1	a	The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.
2579	1	a	The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.
2580	1	a	She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.

2583	1	a	Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.
2584	1	a	She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.
2585	1	a	At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.
2586	1	a	They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.
2587	1	a	It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.
2588	1	a	However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.

2703	1	a	     Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were
2704	1	a	     performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for
2705	1	a	     obstruction.
2706	1	a	Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect
2707	1	a	     both cavities.
2708	1	a	Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration
2709	1	a	     of both oral and intravenous contrast.

2781	1	a	"Assessment and Plan	"
2782	3	a	54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.
2783	1	a	Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
2784	1	a	1.
2785	1	a	GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.
2786	1	a	Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
2787	1	a	Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.
2788	3	a	She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.
2789	1	a	Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.
2790	1	a	We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.
2791	1	a	She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.
2792	1	a	We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
2793	1	a	2.
2794	1	a	HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).
2795	1	a	Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.
2796	1	a	In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
2797	1	a	3.
2798	3	a	DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.
2799	1	a	Will monitor BS.
2800	1	a	4.
2801	1	a	Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

3021	1	a	INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
3022	1	a	There are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device.
3023	1	a	The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device.
3024	1	a	There is evidence of a patent foramen ovale by agitated saline contrast after Valsalva maneuver.
3025	1	a	PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
3026	1	a	There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
3027	1	a	CONCLUSIONS 
3028	1	a	Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever.
3029	1	a	Assessment and plan:
3030	1	a	   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.
3031	1	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
3032	1	a	Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.
3033	1	a	We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.
3034	1	a	If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.
3035	1	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

3153	1	a	2.
3154	1	a	Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem, I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen/pelvis to r/o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE.
3155	1	a	3.
3156	1	a	Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr. Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit.
3157	1	a	He understands this and is still considering this.
3158	1	a	We will continue this discussion in outpatient follow up.

3684	1	a	"	Interval History:"
3685	1	a	   Ms. Kong presents to follow-up her recent hospitalizations.
3686	1	a	Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI.
3687	1	a	The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.
3688	1	a	Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.
3689	1	a	On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.
3690	1	a	Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA.
3691	1	a	Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.
3692	1	a	She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.
3693	1	a	However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest.
3694	1	a	ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).
3695	1	a	TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.
3696	1	a	There was a new apical WMA.
3697	1	a	She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.
3698	1	a	The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (?
3699	1	a	from afib, INR 1.5 on admission).
3700	1	a	She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.
3701	1	a	She was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.
3702	1	a	She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.
3703	1	a	She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.
3704	1	a	However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits.
3705	1	a	No F/C or weight loss.
3706	1	a	She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.
3707	1	a	While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat.
3708	1	a	Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.
3709	1	a	However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week.
3710	1	a	She denies LE edema.
3711	1	a	She's tolerating all medications well.
3712	1	a	Home BS checks have been running 90-130.
3713	1	a	Past medical history:
3714	1	a	   - GBS AoV endocarditis s/p aortic root replacement with 20mm homograft

3762	1	a	   A-V sequentially paced at 70
3763	1	a	"	Impression:"
3764	1	a	   Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months.
3765	1	a	Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning.
3766	1	a	To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home).
3767	1	a	She has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.
3768	1	a	If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix.
3769	1	a	In terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced.
3770	1	a	She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.
3771	1	a	In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement.
3772	1	a	She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.
3773	1	a	With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced.
3774	1	a	If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run.
3775	1	a	She'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.
3776	1	a	Seen with Dr. Richard Oden.

3821	1	a	He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.
3822	1	a	O:   Stool for C. diff.
3823	1	a	and stool C&S were both negative.
3824	1	a	P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,

3833	1	a	          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.
3834	1	a	(4)  Dizziness.
3835	1	a	S:   This has resolved.
3836	3	a	(5)  Diabetes.
3837	1	a	S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar
3838	1	a	          was 44.
3839	1	a	His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.
3840	1	a	He reports

3842	1	a	P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d.
3843	1	a	when his blood sugar is greater than
3844	1	a	          200.
3845	1	a	(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.
3846	1	a	P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the
3847	1	a	          appointment.
3848	1	a	(7)  Coronary artery disease.
3849	1	a	S:   He has had no chest pain.
3850	1	a	He apparently had an appointment last week
3851	1	a	          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was
3852	1	a	          not there.
3853	1	a	He has another appointment later this week with the doctor
3854	1	a	          at the Atlantic North.
3855	1	a	P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent
3856	1	a	          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the
3857	1	a	          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his
3858	1	a	          doctor at the Atlantic North.
3859	1	a	(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization.
3860	1	a	O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).
3861	1	a	Repeat
3862	1	a	          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities.
3863	1	a	P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.
3864	1	a	Check serum protein

3866	1	a	(9)  Chronic anemia.
3867	1	a	O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.
3868	1	a	His
3869	1	a	          hematocrit was stable as of last week.
3870	1	a	P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.
3871	1	a	(10) Decreased HDL.
3872	1	a	A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor
3873	1	a	          to increase the HDL.
3874	1	a	P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician.
3875	1	a	He will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for
3876	1	a	the colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes.

3971	1	a	HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
3972	3	a	dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
3973	1	a	learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
3974	1	a	presenting for follow up of his DVT.
3975	1	a	The patient's current medical 
3976	1	a	problems include:
3977	1	a	1.
3978	1	a	Recent DVT.
3979	1	a	The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
3980	1	a	     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.
3981	1	a	The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
3982	1	a	     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
3983	1	a	     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
3984	1	a	     previously over the recent few weeks.
3985	1	a	The patient stated he awoke 
3986	1	a	     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
3987	1	a	     quadriceps and right calf.
3988	1	a	He later developed progressive swelling 
3989	1	a	     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
3990	1	a	     department.
3991	1	a	He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
3992	1	a	     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.
3993	1	a	He was 
3994	1	a	     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
3995	1	a	The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
3996	1	a	     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
3997	1	a	     sent off which was negative.
3998	1	a	The patient currently returns to me 
3999	1	a	     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.
4000	1	a	He states that 
4001	1	a	     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
4002	1	a	     occur during his hospital course.
4003	1	a	The patient was also angry and 
4004	1	a	     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.
4005	1	a	I 
4006	1	a	     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
4007	1	a	     his emergency department visit.
4008	1	a	I called all of the parties 
4009	1	a	     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
4010	1	a	     occurred.
4011	1	a	2.
4012	1	a	Hypertension.
4013	1	a	The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
4014	1	a	     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
4015	1	a	     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
4016	1	a	     discontinued recently.
4017	1	a	With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
4018	1	a	     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
4019	1	a	3.
4020	3	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
4021	1	a	I recently started the patient on 
4022	1	a	     insulin.
4023	1	a	He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
4024	1	a	     did not make his visit.
4025	1	a	His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
4026	1	a	     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
4027	1	a	     the morning and 15 units of regular.
4028	1	a	In the evening he takes 10 
4029	1	a	     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.
4030	1	a	The patient does not yet have 
4031	1	a	     a home glucometer.
4032	1	a	We will arrange for this.

4035	1	a	Physical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.
4036	1	a	Blood 
4037	1	a	pressure: 135/92.
4038	1	a	Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.
4039	1	a	HEENT: pupils 
4040	1	a	equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, 
4041	1	a	oropharynx clear.
4042	1	a	Mucous membranes moist.
4043	1	a	Cardiac: regular rate and 
4044	1	a	rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
4045	1	a	Lungs: clear to 
4046	1	a	ausculation.
4047	1	a	Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.
4048	1	a	Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
4049	1	a	significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.
4050	1	a	Impression:
4051	1	a	1)   DVT.
4052	1	a	Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
4053	1	a	     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.
4054	1	a	     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
4055	1	a	My feeling is that the DVT 
4056	1	a	     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
4057	1	a	     therapeutic at the present time.
4058	1	a	I have arranged for the patient to 
4059	1	a	     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
4060	1	a	     check of his PT.
4061	1	a	I left instructions that I should be called 
4062	1	a	     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
4063	1	a	     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
4064	1	a	     cane to help with ambulation.
4065	3	a	2)   Adult onset diabetes.
4066	1	a	I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
4067	1	a	     next office visit.
4068	1	a	A finger stick in the office approximately three 
4069	1	a	     hours after eating is 253.
4070	1	a	I feel this is still too elevated.
4071	1	a	     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.
4072	1	a	     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
4073	1	a	     adjustments in his medications at that time.

4099	1	a	Patient becoming very frustrated regarding this.
4100	1	a	Did not keep follow-up with Dr. Espinosa, the neurosurgeon she
4101	1	a	          initially saw.
4102	3	a	(2)  Diabetes: Patient had her first eye exam yesterday with Dr. Dunn, who
4103	1	a	          actually is an optometrist.
4104	1	a	He is referring her to a retinal specialist, due
4105	1	a	          to a question of cystoid macular edema, due to diabetic retinopathy and
4106	1	a	          some possible borderline intraocular pressures.
4107	1	a	The patient is very
4108	1	a	          concerned regarding this.
4109	1	a	Is worried about her heart and kidneys, now
4110	1	a	          that she is having problems with her eyes.
4111	1	a	Is trying to stick to her diet,
4112	1	a	          but is worried.
4113	1	a	Blood sugars at home have been mostly in the 200's,

4123	1	a	A/P: (1)  Chronic neck and shoulder pain with intermittent paresthesias, with
4124	1	a	          MRI showing some chronic degenerative changes, but also mild
4125	1	a	          impingement of the subarachnoid space, possibly even at the cord at C5-6.
4126	1	a	Lengthy discussion with patient regarding this being chronic problem
4127	1	a	          and need to follow up with Dr. Espinosa.
4128	1	a	Will refer to P.T., not only
4129	1	a	          for therapy, but also to re-evaluate ergonomics of her work site, as this
4130	1	a	          may help.
4131	1	a	Continue all other medications, with ice, heat and home
4132	1	a	          exercises.
4133	1	a	Consulted with Dr. Moses, who suggested a TENS Unit may
4134	1	a	          be helpful.
4135	1	a	Will discuss further with patient.
4136	1	a	(2)  AODM: Now with diabetic retinopathy.
4137	1	a	Lengthy discussion of 20 to 30
4138	1	a	          minutes with patient regarding implications of this, as well as need for
4139	3	a	          better diabetic control, especially, as poorly-controlled diabetes is quietly
4140	1	a	          harming both her heart and her kidneys, as well as her blood vessels.
4141	1	a	Patient seems more motivated now to try to adhere to diet and exercise.
4142	1	a	Refer to Dr. Larry Kowalski, a retinal specialist, as soon as possible.
4143	1	a	Patient
4144	1	a	          promises to do her bloodwork for her RFT's, fasting lipids, FBS,
4145	1	a	          hemoglobin A1C, as well as urine microalbumin.

4152	1	a	MRN:     8514931
4153	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian
4154	1	a	female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness.
4155	1	a	Her daughter,
4156	1	a	who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today.
4157	1	a	Apparently, for
4158	1	a	"many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled"""
4159	1	a	when she walks.
4160	1	a	This never occurs when lying down or sitting.
4161	1	a	It is only when she is
4162	1	a	walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or
4163	1	a	backward.
4164	1	a	At times, she does visibly veer when she walks.
4165	1	a	She has had one fall a
4166	1	a	number of months ago when she broke her wrist.
4167	1	a	She has not had any subsequent
4168	1	a	falls.
4169	1	a	There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,
4170	1	a	numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache.
4171	1	a	She actually
4172	1	a	feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it
4173	1	a	was a little more severe.
4174	1	a	Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.
4175	1	a	Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.
4176	1	a	Review of other systems notable for general fatigue.
4177	1	a	Otherwise unremarkable.
4178	1	a	No
4179	1	a	chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
4180	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,
4181	1	a	hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts.
4182	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,
4183	1	a	Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx.
4184	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.
4185	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece.
4186	1	a	She neither drinks nor
4187	1	a	smokes.
4188	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,
4189	1	a	72-year-old female.
4190	1	a	BP 140/84.
4191	1	a	Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,
4192	1	a	except for decreased hearing on the left.
4193	1	a	On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift.
4194	1	a	Good
4195	1	a	power throughout upper and lower extremities.
4196	1	a	She does, however, seem mildly
4197	1	a	bradykinetic diffusely.
4198	1	a	Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric.
4199	1	a	Amplitude
4200	1	a	is normal for finger tapping.
4201	1	a	Power in the lower extremities 5/5.
4202	1	a	Sensory exam with
4203	1	a	mild vibratory loss in the toes.
4204	1	a	Finger-to-nose testing intact.
4205	1	a	Foot-tapping decreased
4206	1	a	bilaterally.
4207	1	a	Romberg sway.
4208	1	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to
4209	1	a	either side.
4210	1	a	She is unable to perform tandem.
4211	1	a	DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+
4212	1	a	ankle jerks.
4213	1	a	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
4214	1	a	DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter
4215	1	a	hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral
4216	1	a	pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right
4217	1	a	internal capsule and bilateral thalami.
4218	1	a	Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the
4219	1	a	anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the
4220	1	a	posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment
4221	1	a	stenosis of the basilar artery.
4222	1	a	Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134.
4223	1	a	8/30
4224	1	a	bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits.
4225	1	a	LFT's normal except SGOT
4226	1	a	elevated at 46.
4227	3	a	IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and
4228	1	a	hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady.
4229	1	a	She is
4230	1	a	symptomatic only when she walks.
4231	1	a	Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
4232	1	a	toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the
4233	1	a	wide-based, at times veering gait.
4234	1	a	It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are
4235	1	a	multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.
4236	1	a	It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given
4237	1	a	that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she
4238	1	a	is concerned about.
4239	1	a	However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,
4240	1	a	she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she
4241	1	a	became hypotensive.
4242	1	a	As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding
4243	1	a	Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she
4244	1	a	can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine.
4245	1	a	I will see her in follow up in two
4246	1	a	months to see how she is doing.
4247	1	a	May also consider checking CBC, given her
4248	1	a	symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

4530	1	a	Rheumatology Visit
4531	1	a	CANTU, VERNA L                        
4532	1	a	MRN:  0261948
4533	1	a	Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
4534	1	a	Background:
4535	3	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
4536	1	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
4537	1	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
4538	1	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
4539	1	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
4540	1	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
4541	1	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
4542	1	a	Slowly these lesions healed.
4543	1	a	Interim Issues:
4544	3	a	The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
4545	1	a	But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
4546	1	a	In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
4547	1	a	Recovering from surgery has been slow.
4548	1	a	But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
4549	1	a	She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home.
4550	1	a	She has had no recurrent chest pain.
4551	1	a	She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
4552	1	a	She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se.
4553	1	a	She healed well postoperatively.
4554	1	a	She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
4555	1	a	Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
4556	1	a	In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's.
4557	1	a	She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
4558	1	a	What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
4559	1	a	She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
4560	1	a	She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
4561	1	a	She has had no worsening swallowing.
4562	1	a	She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
4563	1	a	She sleeps on two pillows.
4564	1	a	She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
4565	1	a	She continues on omeprazole.
4566	1	a	Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.
4567	1	a	MEDS:
4568	1	a	Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
4569	1	a	Aspirin  325 MG QD  
4570	1	a	Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD 
4571	1	a	Lisinopril 2.5 MG QD 
4572	1	a	Metformin 500 MG BID 
4573	1	a	Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD 
4574	1	a	Plaquenil  200 MG  QD 
4575	1	a	Simvastatin 20 MG  QHS
4576	1	a	FH/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better.
4577	1	a	Ms. Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery.
4578	1	a	PMH:

4588	1	a	O2 SAT 98
4589	1	a	PAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0
4590	1	a	She has telangiectasias over her face.
4591	1	a	She looks well to me.
4592	1	a	Her color is good and she smiles easily.
4593	1	a	She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes.
4594	1	a	Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here.
4595	1	a	Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well.
4596	1	a	But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma.
4597	1	a	The midline scar has healed beautifully.
4598	1	a	The respiratory excursions appear full.
4599	1	a	There is no splinting.
4600	1	a	There are some bilateral crackles.
4601	1	a	Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease.
4602	1	a	There are no nail bed infarcts.
4603	1	a	There is some peripheral pitting of digits.
4604	1	a	Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused.
4605	1	a	Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis.
4606	1	a	Heart: S1, S2 with a soft crisp, S2 noted.
4607	1	a	No insufficiency murmurs.

4613	1	a	PLAN
4614	1	a	Education regarding the importance of protection re: trauma to finger tips and prevention of Raynaud's.
4615	1	a	Continue Prilosec, refill Plaquenil
4616	1	a	Prescribe prednisone 5 mg p.r.n.
4617	1	a	arthritis.
4618	3	a	I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks.
4619	1	a	Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained.
4620	1	a	I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim.
4621	1	a	Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient.
4622	1	a	She and her husband agree with this plan.

4704	1	a	History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
4705	1	a	this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
4706	3	a	diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.
4707	1	a	Also 
4708	1	a	with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
4709	1	a	hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d.
4710	1	a	for the last year, which he discontinued 
4711	1	a	last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
4712	1	a	he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
4713	1	a	he is afraid that his sugar is up.
4714	1	a	He states that over the last two or 
4715	1	a	three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
4716	1	a	followed by mild headaches.
4717	1	a	He says that the visual changes are usually 
4718	1	a	accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
4719	1	a	Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.
4720	1	a	He does admit to a history of 
4721	1	a	migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
4722	1	a	severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
4723	1	a	migraine aura.
4724	1	a	He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
4725	1	a	they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
4726	1	a	to this appointment at this time.
4727	1	a	He denies any fevers.
4728	1	a	He does have a 
4729	1	a	recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a

4733	1	a	which is watery in nature without any blood.
4734	1	a	He has no nausea or 
4735	1	a	vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
4736	1	a	this in the past.
4737	1	a	His past medical history is otherwise benign.
4738	1	a	Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
4739	1	a	basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
4740	1	a	pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
4741	1	a	from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
4742	1	a	frequently.
4743	1	a	He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.
4744	1	a	He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.
4745	1	a	He is sexually 
4746	1	a	active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
4747	1	a	Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
4748	3	a	diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
4749	1	a	history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.
4750	1	a	His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
4751	1	a	alive and well without any medical problems.

4760	1	a	Oropharynx was clear.
4761	1	a	He had no thyromegaly.
4762	1	a	His chest was clear.
4763	1	a	His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
4764	1	a	heart sounds were normal.
4765	1	a	His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
4766	1	a	without any hepatosplenomegaly.
4767	1	a	Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
4768	1	a	descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
4769	1	a	heme positive stool.
4770	1	a	Neurologic exam was intact.
4771	1	a	Assessment and Plan:  
4772	1	a	1.
4773	3	a	Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
4774	1	a	     sugar at this time.
4775	1	a	Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
4776	1	a	     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
4777	1	a	     to 10 mg. q.d.
4778	1	a	He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
4779	1	a	     control as well.
4780	1	a	2.
4781	1	a	Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.
4782	1	a	I 
4783	1	a	     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
4784	1	a	     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
4785	1	a	     diet.
4786	1	a	3.
4787	1	a	Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.
4788	1	a	I will get a 
4789	1	a	     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
4790	1	a	     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4791	1	a	4.
4792	1	a	Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
4793	1	a	     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
4794	1	a	     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
4795	1	a	     time.

4804	1	a	This patient was seen, interviewed, and examined by myself
4805	1	a	primarily.
4806	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who
4807	1	a	presents with body swelling and shortness of breath.
4808	1	a	The patient
4809	1	a	is unable to say when she specifically noted her lower extremity
4810	1	a	swelling.
4811	1	a	She states that approximately 1 year prior to arrival
4812	1	a	she had to throw out all of her shoes except for 2 pairs because
4813	1	a	all those shoes had become tight.
4814	1	a	At the present time, the
4815	1	a	patient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her
4816	1	a	co-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested
4817	1	a	that she see a physician.
4818	1	a	The patient states that there was no
4819	1	a	acute change in her swelling today.
4820	1	a	She states that she has had
4821	1	a	a cough for 1 month.
4822	1	a	Again, there was no acute change.
4823	1	a	Today,
4824	1	a	she denies any chest pain at any time.
4825	1	a	She does complain of
4826	1	a	dyspnea and specifically dyspnea on exertion, no PND, no
4827	1	a	orthopnea, and no change in her overall energy level.

4924	1	a	Dizziness and change in mental status
4925	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
4926	1	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o, who p/w dizziness that began 2 to 3 weeks ago.
4927	1	a	The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving.
4928	1	a	The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down.
4929	1	a	He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.
4930	1	a	He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped.
4931	1	a	He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages.
4932	1	a	During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious.
4933	1	a	He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication.
4934	1	a	Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
4935	1	a	Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.
4936	1	a	Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.

5056	1	a	CXR: No pneumonia or other significant change from 11/26/52.

5058	1	a	Chronic infarctions of the pons and right frontal operculum, unchanged.
5059	1	a	EKG

5061	1	a	PR&lt; 200 ms, QRS&lt; 110 ms, QTc&gt;470
5062	1	a	ASSESSMENT
5063	3	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
5064	1	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
5065	1	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
5066	1	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
5067	1	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
5068	1	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
5069	1	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
5070	1	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
5071	1	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
5072	1	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
5073	1	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
5074	1	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
5075	1	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
5076	1	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
5077	1	a	PLAN
5078	1	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
5079	1	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
5080	1	a	-D/c naproxen use.
5081	1	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
5082	1	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
5083	1	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
5084	3	a	#) DM
5085	1	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.
5086	1	a	#) CAD
5087	1	a	      -Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF
5088	1	a	#) HTN
5089	1	a	-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.
5090	1	a	#) Gout
5091	1	a	      -D/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves
5092	1	a	#)Hypercholesterolemia
5093	1	a	-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin  20 MG PO QHS)
5094	1	a	#) Psoriasis
5095	1	a	-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005%   TOP BID prn
5096	1	a	#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy
5097	1	a	      -Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.

5123	1	a	Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.
5124	1	a	Skeletal films are pending.
5125	3	a	Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD.
5126	1	a	Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..
5127	1	a	He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.
5128	1	a	I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.
5129	1	a	I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.
5130	1	a	However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.
5131	1	a	In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.
5132	1	a	He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.
5133	1	a	Thank you for referring this patient.
5134	1	a	Sincerely,

5268	1	a	HPI: 
5269	1	a	This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain.
5270	1	a	The first episode started this AM (10AM).

5272	1	a	Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v.
5273	1	a	Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.
5274	1	a	He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case.
5275	1	a	He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.
5276	1	a	Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain.
5277	1	a	On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain.
5278	1	a	He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker.
5279	1	a	His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3.
5280	1	a	First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

6320	1	a	"Re:  	Horn, Gregory"
6321	1	a	"      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23"
6322	1	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
6323	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.
6324	1	a	VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.
6325	1	a	Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous.
6326	1	a	For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.
6327	1	a	The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.
6328	1	a	He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.
6329	1	a	He has managed to lose 6 lbs.
6330	1	a	by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.
6331	1	a	GE reflux is very well controlled.
6332	1	a	Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.
6333	1	a	On Examination:  He is well appearing.
6334	1	a	Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.
6335	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
6336	1	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
6337	1	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter.
6338	1	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.
6339	1	a	Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.
6340	1	a	Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
6341	1	a	Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis.
6342	1	a	Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.
6343	1	a	Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.
6344	1	a	Weight is 238 lbs.
6345	1	a	(BMI 38).
6346	1	a	Impression:
6347	1	a	1.
6348	1	a	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.
6349	1	a	I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.
6350	1	a	I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.
6351	1	a	I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.
6352	1	a	If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.
6353	1	a	The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.
6354	1	a	I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs.
6355	1	a	to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.
6356	1	a	Hence, he has his work cut out for him.
6357	1	a	2.
6358	1	a	Obesity - As above.
6359	1	a	3.
6360	3	a	Diabetes.
6361	1	a	4.
6362	1	a	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.
6363	1	a	5.
6364	1	a	GE reflux - As mentioned.
6365	1	a	6.
6366	1	a	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.
6367	1	a	Recommendations:
6368	1	a	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.
6369	1	a	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d.
6370	1	a	- as 20 mg b.i.d.
6371	1	a	did not give full control with the generic pills.
6372	1	a	We will review pathology.
6373	1	a	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.
6374	1	a	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.
6375	1	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
6376	1	a	Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.
6377	1	a	Sincerely,

6381	1	a	EDVISIT^46103196^HART, MATTHEW^06/14/79^NAPOLITANO, URSULA
6382	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male
6383	1	a	with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
6384	3	a	history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and
6385	1	a	DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently
6386	1	a	missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal
6387	1	a	girth and shortness of breath.
6388	1	a	He said that his father has been
6389	1	a	sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time
6390	1	a	helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday
6391	1	a	and missed his Friday dialysis run.
6392	1	a	Today is Sunday and he
6393	1	a	generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.
6394	1	a	When I asked if he
6395	1	a	has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,
6396	1	a	but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and
6397	1	a	was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the
6398	1	a	pain.
6399	1	a	Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain
6400	1	a	when he was exerting himself.
6401	1	a	He does feel slightly increased
6402	1	a	shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks
6403	1	a	that because of increased fluids.
6404	1	a	He has had no fevers or
6405	1	a	chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.
6406	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
6407	1	a	coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,
6408	3	a	diabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,
6409	1	a	substance abuse and GERD.
6410	1	a	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.
6411	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine
6412	1	a	use.
6413	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.
6414	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.
6415	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed, please see the list.
6416	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.
6417	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,
6418	1	a	respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%
6419	1	a	on room air.
6420	1	a	The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete
6421	1	a	sentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable.
6422	1	a	ENT:  Atraumatic.
6423	1	a	Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.
6424	1	a	Chest:  Clear to
6425	1	a	auscultation bilaterally, no rales.
6426	1	a	Cardiovascular:  Regular
6427	1	a	rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
6428	1	a	Abdomen:  Minimal
6429	1	a	distention, soft.
6430	1	a	No focal tenderness.
6431	1	a	Skin is intact.
6432	1	a	Extremities:  No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf
6433	1	a	tenderness bilaterally.
6434	1	a	Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.
6435	1	a	Cranial
6436	1	a	nerves II through XII tested and intact.
6437	1	a	No motor or sensory
6438	1	a	deficits.
6439	1	a	Gait is normal.
6440	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which
6441	1	a	showed normal sinus rhythm.
6442	1	a	No significant ST or T
6443	1	a	abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with
6444	1	a	his previous EKG.
6445	1	a	PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of
6446	1	a	acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.
6447	1	a	Only labs which resulted
6448	1	a	initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets
6449	1	a	423,000 and white count of 6.74.
6450	1	a	We made contact with the renal
6451	1	a	fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the
6452	1	a	dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this
6453	1	a	patient.
6454	1	a	His potassium was not back at the time that he left the
6455	1	a	department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias
6456	1	a	on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is
6457	1	a	very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess
6458	1	a	when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure
6459	1	a	that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.
6460	1	a	After he
6461	1	a	left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1
6462	1	a	and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a
6463	1	a	chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,
6464	1	a	glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium
6465	1	a	8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called
6466	1	a	the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have
6467	1	a	the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to
6468	1	a	treat him there acutely.
6469	1	a	Again after the dialysis, the patient
6470	1	a	will return to the Emergency Department.
6471	1	a	We will reassess if
6472	1	a	symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes.
6473	1	a	If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no
6474	1	a	chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for
6475	1	a	acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not
6476	1	a	acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he
6477	1	a	will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis
6478	1	a	schedule.
6479	1	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.
6480	1	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
6481	1	a	DISPOSITION:  Pending.
6482	1	a	Please see ED note for further ED course.
6483	1	a	This was a shared
6484	1	a	visit with resident physician, Dr. Adam Mcclure.

6496	3	a	HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
6497	1	a	regular follow-up.
6498	1	a	Assessment and Plan:
6499	1	a	1.
6500	3	a	Diabetes.
6501	1	a	She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
6502	1	a	     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
6503	1	a	     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.
6504	1	a	This is 
6505	1	a	     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.
6506	1	a	She 
6507	1	a	     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
6508	1	a	     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.
6509	1	a	She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
6510	1	a	     and urine dip.
6511	1	a	She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
6512	1	a	     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.
6513	1	a	She also needs 
6514	1	a	     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
6515	1	a	2.
6516	1	a	Health maintenance.
6517	1	a	Patient does not want a flu shot.
6518	1	a	Otherwise, 
6519	1	a	     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
6520	1	a	     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.
6521	1	a	We will do so.
6522	1	a	3.
6523	1	a	Migraine headaches.
6524	1	a	She said she has had one every day recently.
6525	1	a	This is worse than her usual.
6526	1	a	The Motrin was not helping.
6527	1	a	I 
6528	1	a	     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
6529	1	a	     use.
6530	1	a	Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.
6531	1	a	I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
6532	1	a	4.
6533	1	a	Ankle pain.
6534	1	a	Patient has chronic ankle pain.
6535	1	a	She went to an 
6536	1	a	     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
6537	1	a	     got better.
6538	1	a	She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
6539	1	a	     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.
6540	1	a	I therefore referred 
6541	1	a	     her at her request.

6911	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Haynes is a 69-year-old woman who comes in followup of her recent hospitalization and rehabilitation.
6912	1	a	She is here with her daughter.
6913	1	a	She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately.
6914	1	a	She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance.
6915	1	a	She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions.
6916	1	a	She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results.
6917	1	a	In the morning, the sugars have been fairly low in the 57-100 range, around noontime high at 144 up to 398, and in the evening high again 176-245.
6918	1	a	She is taking Lantus 38 units at 9:00 p.m. and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 25-0 units, 125-152 units, 151-204 units, 201-256 units, 251-308 units and greater than 310 units.
6919	1	a	She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her.
6920	1	a	She complains of hemorrhoids, although she says they are actually getting better, she had previously had four now she has two.
6921	1	a	There is no bleeding.
6922	1	a	There is no pain, kind of itchy and uncomfortable.
6923	1	a	She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time.
6924	1	a	She is having bowel movements every day.
6925	1	a	She is not having any chest pain, no trouble breathing, no fevers, sweats or chills.
6926	1	a	No abdominal symptoms.
6927	1	a	She notes her stomach is really fine and it just not causing any trouble at all.
6928	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril 40 daily, Lantus 38, NovoLog coverage, omeprazole 40 daily, metoprolol, potassium chloride, Lasix 40 daily, Pravachol 40 nightly, and Symbicort.
6929	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Bactrim GI intolerance, fluticasone, cough and sucralfate unknown.
6930	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has never smoked, no alcohol, no street drugs.
6931	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.
6932	1	a	Blood pressure 121/65, pulse 106, weight 169.8, and temperature 98.6.
6933	1	a	A delightful woman, English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair.
6934	1	a	Quite alert, did know the president, could not recall the vice-president or against whom the president ran in the last election.
6935	1	a	She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was.
6936	1	a	She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot.
6937	1	a	She is an absolutely delightful woman, appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses.
6938	1	a	She appears comfortable, breathing easily, no use of accessory muscles of inspiration, speaking in full sentences, no cough, no spine or flank tenderness.
6939	1	a	Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.
6940	1	a	Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
6941	1	a	She is clear to percussion.
6942	1	a	Extremities:  Without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.
6943	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
6944	1	a	1.
6945	3	a	Diabetes.
6946	0	a	Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.
6947	1	a	I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.
6948	1	a	We will continue for now.
6949	1	a	I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes.
6950	1	a	2.
6951	1	a	Hypertension.
6952	1	a	Her blood pressure is fine.
6953	1	a	We will continue current regimen.
6954	1	a	We will check electrolytes.
6955	1	a	3.
6956	1	a	Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit.
6957	1	a	She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.
6958	1	a	4.
6959	1	a	Fatigue.
6960	1	a	This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40.
6961	1	a	This is what the patient and her daughter believe.
6962	1	a	She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this.
6963	1	a	She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her.
6964	1	a	Check cbc.
6965	1	a	5.
6966	1	a	Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole.
6967	1	a	6.
6968	1	a	Right knee mild osteoarthritis, not a problem today.
6969	1	a	7.
6970	1	a	CNS syphilis status post treatment.
6971	1	a	8.
6972	1	a	Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 40 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else.
6973	1	a	9.
6974	1	a	Cholesterol.
6975	1	a	We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT.
6976	1	a	10.
6977	1	a	Thyroid nodules.
6978	1	a	Ultrasound in July 2103 showed stability.
6979	1	a	11.
6980	1	a	Adrenal adenoma.
6981	1	a	Her CAT scan in May 2102 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid.
6982	1	a	12.
6983	1	a	Lichen simplex chronicus.
6984	1	a	Dermatology diagnosis from 2101.
6985	1	a	Not addressed today.
6986	1	a	Hopefully, she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck.
6987	1	a	13.
6988	1	a	Osteopenia.
6989	1	a	She will continue calcium and vitamin D.  I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.
6990	1	a	14.
6991	1	a	Glaucoma suspect, not addressed today.
6992	1	a	15.
6993	1	a	Small vessel ischemic disease.
6994	1	a	MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke.
6995	1	a	She is currently on aspirin and stable.
6996	1	a	16.
6997	1	a	Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given.
6998	1	a	Given no bleeding and no pian, this hopefully will fuffice.
6999	1	a	Recommended avoiding constipation, as she is doing, with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables.
7000	1	a	HgA1C 6.6
7001	1	a	CBC slightly elevated WBC likely due to prednisone
7002	1	a	SGPT, lytes o.k.
7003	1	a	CHOL LDL 1124 elevated but HDL also high, protective, cntu pravachol and rercheck

7253	1	a	Date of admission: 08/28/2097
7254	1	a	"Admitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD	"
7255	1	a	PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel
7256	1	a	Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note
7257	1	a	Code: Full
7258	1	a	CC:     Want to get my chemo   
7259	1	a	ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.
7260	1	a	HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
7261	1	a	He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.
7262	1	a	He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.
7263	1	a	He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
7264	1	a	Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
7265	1	a	The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.
7266	1	a	PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.
7267	1	a	It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
7268	1	a	The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
7269	1	a	PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
7270	1	a	The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.
7271	3	a	Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.
7272	1	a	Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.
7273	1	a	Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.
7274	1	a	He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
7275	1	a	Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
7276	1	a	He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
7277	1	a	On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.
7278	1	a	He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
7279	1	a	He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
7280	1	a	He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.
7281	1	a	Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

7441	1	a	Dear Dr. Feldman:
7442	1	a	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
7443	1	a	today in the Cardiology clinic.
7444	1	a	As you know, she is a
7445	3	a	very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
7446	1	a	dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
7447	1	a	disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
7448	1	a	echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
7449	1	a	She
7450	1	a	last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
7451	1	a	appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
7452	1	a	Oregon.
7453	1	a	Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
7454	1	a	been doing quite well.
7455	1	a	She states that she has episodes of
7456	1	a	palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
7457	1	a	minutes.
7458	1	a	She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
7459	1	a	no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
7460	1	a	She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.
7461	1	a	Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
7462	1	a	continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.
7463	1	a	states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
7464	1	a	Cessation Program.
7465	1	a	Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
7466	1	a	q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
7467	1	a	q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
7468	1	a	Protonix, and Allegra.
7469	1	a	On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress.
7470	1	a	Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
7471	1	a	beats per minute.
7472	1	a	Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
7473	1	a	edema.
7474	1	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
7475	1	a	JVP is 8 cm of water.
7476	1	a	Chest is clear to auscultation and
7477	1	a	percussion bilaterally.
7478	1	a	PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
7479	1	a	physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.
7480	1	a	Abdomen
7481	1	a	is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
7482	1	a	Pulse examination is
7483	1	a	normal.
7484	1	a	Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
7485	1	a	ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
7486	1	a	minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
7487	1	a	467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.
7488	1	a	There is a nonspecific Q-wave
7489	1	a	abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
7490	1	a	compared to prior.
7491	1	a	In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.
7492	1	a	Her palpitations and
7493	1	a	likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
7494	1	a	quite acceptable for her.
7495	1	a	Therefore, she wishes no consideration
7496	1	a	of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
7497	1	a	has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
7498	1	a	Regarding
7499	1	a	her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
7500	1	a	well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
7501	3	a	diabetes.
7502	1	a	However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
7503	1	a	LDL.
7504	1	a	Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
7505	1	a	to 40 mg q.h.s.
7506	1	a	I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
7507	1	a	Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
7508	1	a	cardiovascular issues.
7509	1	a	Thank you very much for referring this
7510	1	a	very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
7511	1	a	Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
7512	1	a	preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

7606	1	a	MR#:  2793372 
7607	1	a	DOB:  January 16, 2082 
7608	1	a	Dear Dr. Duvall:  
7609	1	a	Thank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.
7610	1	a	I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.
7611	3	a	Mr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.
7612	1	a	The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.
7613	1	a	In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.
7614	1	a	In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.
7615	1	a	The patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.
7616	1	a	He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.
7617	1	a	In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.
7618	1	a	According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.
7619	1	a	He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.
7620	1	a	The patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.

7683	3	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.
7684	1	a	He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.
7685	1	a	As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.
7686	1	a	He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.
7687	1	a	I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.
7688	1	a	The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.
7689	1	a	MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.
7690	1	a	The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.
7691	1	a	He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.
7692	1	a	The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.
7693	1	a	Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.
7694	1	a	Sincerely,

7847	1	a	NSR.
7848	1	a	New TWI in V2, q in III, normal axis and intervals, no ST changes
7849	1	a	"	          	          "
7850	1	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
7851	3	a	The patient is a 74 yo female with poorly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting.
7852	1	a	1.
7853	1	a	Glaucoma.
7854	1	a	Likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
7855	1	a	As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds
7856	1	a	"	-Xalatan qHS"
7857	1	a	-Pred Forte QID
7858	1	a	-Timolol BID
7859	1	a	-Trusopt BID
7860	1	a	-Acetazolamide BID
7861	1	a	-Alphagan
7862	1	a	IOP will be monitored closely.
7863	1	a	If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.
7864	1	a	2.
7865	1	a	Nausea and Vomiting
7866	1	a	The differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.
7867	1	a	Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.
7868	1	a	"-	I ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read."
7869	1	a	"-	I think angina is unlikely given her history."
7870	3	a	However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.
7871	1	a	I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.
7872	1	a	I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE.
7873	1	a	I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1.
7874	1	a	"-	Chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin."
7875	1	a	I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.
7876	1	a	3.
7877	1	a	Chronic Renal Failure
7878	1	a	This is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
7879	1	a	Pt is at baseline creatinine
7880	1	a	4.
7881	1	a	Anemia
7882	1	a	Pt is at baseline creatinine.
7883	1	a	She was found to have sickle cell trait.
7884	1	a	5.
7885	1	a	Diabetes
7886	1	a	Will continue NPH and Regular insulin and cover with SSI.
7887	1	a	6.
7888	1	a	Prophylaxis
7889	1	a	On nexium.
7890	1	a	Holding heparin prophylaxis because the patient is ambulatory.

8538	3	a	                88 yo female with a PMH of DM, HTN, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.
8539	1	a	ISSUE #1: Fever and tremors.
8540	1	a	Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.
8541	1	a	A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.
8542	1	a	An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.
8543	1	a	In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.
8544	1	a	Continue to follow lytes, CK, CBC
8545	1	a	Small doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety
8546	1	a	AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)
8547	1	a	Continue antibiotics, F/U cultures
8548	1	a	ISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.
8549	1	a	Keep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically

8566	1	a	   Asked by Medicine team to see this 88 yo woman who presents with UGIB 9 d after inferior STEMI/BMS PCI to PLV/RCA
8567	1	a	"	Interval History:"
8568	3	a	   Ms. Ulrich is a 88 yo w/ h/o CAD, DM2, and dyslipidemia, who was admitted 10 d ago with an inferior STEMI in the setting of nauseau and CP, who subsequently received BMS stents to the RPLV and mid RCA.
8569	1	a	Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting.
8570	1	a	She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8/10/96 for PT/OT.
8571	1	a	At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB.
8572	1	a	She denies CP/SOB/N at present.
8573	1	a	She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight.
8574	1	a	She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.
8575	1	a	Past medical history:
8576	1	a	   1.
8577	1	a	CAD:
8578	1	a	-s/p PCI of PDA 2089 for 99% lesion in setting of ACS, s/p PCI of 99% LAD lesion in 2090 also in setting of ACS, residual LV function normal w/o focal WMA in 2091.
8579	1	a	Inferior STEMI 7/96 due to near occlusion of PLV resulting in BMS to PLV and mid RCA.
8580	1	a	2.
8581	1	a	HTN/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures.
8582	1	a	Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia.
8583	1	a	BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.
8584	1	a	Hypertensive HD manifest primarily as peripheral edema, worsened by norvasc, improved on diuretic.

8607	1	a	   There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:  Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI.
8608	1	a	Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.
8609	1	a	Social history:

8630	1	a	"	Impression:"
8631	3	a	   88 yo woman with extensive CAD history, HTN and DM2 recently started on oral agents, now presents with UGIB in setting of plavix extended reload of 150 QD x 1 week.
8632	1	a	Agree with reducing plavix to 75 QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.
8633	1	a	Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.
8634	1	a	Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.
8635	1	a	Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.
8636	1	a	Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.
8637	1	a	If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.
8638	1	a	Will follow with you.

8647	1	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
8648	1	a	was positive.
8649	1	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
8650	1	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
8651	1	a	She had 1mm 
8652	1	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
8653	1	a	disease.
8654	1	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
8655	1	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
8656	1	a	She vehemently denies that she 
8657	1	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
8658	1	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
8659	1	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
8660	1	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
8661	1	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
8662	1	a	She 
8663	1	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
8664	1	a	for taking it.
8665	1	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
8666	1	a	on atenolol.
8667	1	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
8668	1	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
8669	1	a	I will continue to work 
8670	1	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
8671	1	a	Her other risk 
8672	3	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
8673	1	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
8674	1	a	Her 
8675	3	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
8676	1	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
8677	1	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
8678	1	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
8679	1	a	hospital.

8692	1	a	The patient returns not having been seen since last September by
8693	1	a	me and at which time she had some chest pain which did not turn
8694	1	a	out to be anything significant.
8695	1	a	She is followed up by Dr. Horne
8696	1	a	who felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time
8697	1	a	on lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications.
8698	1	a	She
8699	1	a	comes back from Maine.
8700	1	a	She is on the following medications:

8725	1	a	She states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past
8726	1	a	5 days.
8727	1	a	She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days.
8728	1	a	ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks.
8729	1	a	She takes
8730	1	a	nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about
8731	1	a	her daughter who is homeless.
8732	1	a	She has provided for her daughter,
8733	1	a	helped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I
8734	1	a	have advised the patient that she should be in a mental
8735	1	a	institution.
8736	1	a	The patient no longer care for her daughter and her
8737	1	a	daughter cares nothing about her father and mother.
8738	1	a	It is a
8739	1	a	hopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the
8740	1	a	daughter's illness and what the patient would do about this.
8741	1	a	I
8742	1	a	have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by
8743	1	a	mouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an
8744	1	a	uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to
8745	3	a	check on her diabetes, kidney function, etc.
8746	1	a	She has a good
8747	1	a	physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and
8748	1	a	she will return to me next week for a complete physical.
8749	1	a	does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild.
8750	1	a	Her back has healed.
8751	1	a	She no longer uses a cane to walk except
8752	1	a	on climbing stairs.
8753	1	a	She no longer has any chest pain or
8754	1	a	shortness of breath.
8755	1	a	She is extraordinarily anxious and
8756	1	a	hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.
8757	1	a	Total
8758	1	a	time spent during this visit was 45 minutes.

8918	1	a	"Interim History:	"
8919	1	a	Comes to review her medical problems.
8920	1	a	Her ETT showed mild distal anterior and antero-apical ischemia.
8921	1	a	The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images.
8922	1	a	The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate.
8923	1	a	Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose.
8924	1	a	Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5.
8925	1	a	BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired.
8926	1	a	Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it.
8927	1	a	Home Blood Tests:  Not very good by history.
8928	0	a	A1c over 9%.
8929	1	a	She still has trouble focusing on it.
8930	1	a	"Retinopathy:	Visions stable."
8931	1	a	"Nephropathy:	Cr slightly up to 1.5"

8949	1	a	Reduce the captopril to 6.25 mg bid.
8950	1	a	Report back BP; may have room to go up to 25 mg bid on the atenolol.
8951	1	a	She does have some hypoglycemia and symptoms are sometimes subtle.

8964	1	a	02/02/79
8965	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ickes comes in with pain in his right 
8966	1	a	hip, left shoulder and for follow up of his coronary artery disease and 
8967	1	a	his left wrist.
8968	1	a	His right hip continues to be painful at times.
8969	1	a	A radiogram in December 
8970	1	a	showed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.
8971	1	a	He has been taking 
8972	1	a	Motrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.
8973	1	a	His left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually 
8974	1	a	is somewhat better than it has been.
8975	1	a	It hurts to abduct him more than 
8976	1	a	90 degrees or to reach behind his back.
8977	1	a	His left wrist is bothering him some now.
8978	1	a	It is sore with most types of 
8979	1	a	motion.
8980	3	a	Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this 
8981	1	a	morning.
8982	1	a	Regarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning.
8983	1	a	He 
8984	1	a	has had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.
8985	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, 
8986	1	a	pulse is 70 and regular.
8987	1	a	He is a pleasant black man in no apparent 
8988	1	a	distress.
8989	1	a	Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
8990	1	a	Chest 
8991	1	a	is clear to auscultation and percussion.
8992	1	a	Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate 
8993	1	a	and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.
8994	1	a	Abdomen is soft.
8995	1	a	Extremities, 
8996	1	a	without edema.
8997	1	a	Right hip, no pain with leg rolling.
8998	1	a	Left shoulder is 
8999	1	a	able to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to 
9000	1	a	abduct completely with only minimal discomfort.
9001	1	a	It is nontender to 
9002	1	a	palpation.
9003	1	a	Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint 
9004	1	a	line.
9005	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
9006	1	a	1.
9007	1	a	Right hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him 
9008	1	a	to continue on the Motrin as needed.
9009	1	a	2.
9010	1	a	Left shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.
9011	1	a	He feels this has 
9012	1	a	improved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different 
9013	1	a	for now but will let me know if it causes more problems.

9019	1	a	Left wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.
9020	1	a	He is tender in the joint line today.
9021	1	a	It is bothering him a little 
9022	1	a	bit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.
9023	1	a	4.
9024	1	a	Coronary disease:  He has been doing well from this prospective.
9025	1	a	has no recent chest pain, pressure or discomfort and his LDL has been 
9026	1	a	very well controlled.
9027	1	a	5.
9028	3	a	Diabetes:  His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated and we will 
9029	1	a	check another one today.

9067	1	a	Patient Name:  Michael Yee
9068	1	a	PH#:  69044681
9069	1	a	Date/Time:  12/24/94; 2:30 PM
9070	1	a	Attending:  Dr. Quintrell Ferreira
9071	1	a	CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents
9072	1	a	HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.
9073	1	a	He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).
9074	1	a	She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.
9075	1	a	He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.
9076	1	a	His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.
9077	1	a	He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.
9078	1	a	The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.
9079	1	a	We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.
9080	3	a	PMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)

9096	1	a	A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.
9097	1	a	His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.
9098	1	a	He is being managed by ID.
9099	1	a	His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.
9100	1	a	His abdominal CT is pending.
9101	1	a	He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.
9102	1	a	As such, we recommend:
9103	1	a	--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
9104	1	a	--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
9105	1	a	Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
9106	1	a	Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.
9107	1	a	D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.
9108	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

9225	1	a	59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN.
9226	1	a	Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:
9227	1	a	NPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast
9228	1	a	Regular 10+ scale qPM before  supper
9229	1	a	NPH 30 at bedtime
9230	1	a	QID Regular sliding scale
9231	1	a	These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
9232	1	a	I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
9233	1	a	I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
9234	1	a	Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
9235	1	a	He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency.
9236	1	a	If you agree, would start iron repletion.
9237	1	a	(Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)
9238	1	a	Thanks.

9374	1	a	       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.
9375	1	a	He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.
9376	1	a	He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081.
9377	1	a	He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects.
9378	1	a	Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.
9379	1	a	evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally

9393	1	a	Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia.
9394	1	a	PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia.
9395	1	a	DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain.
9396	3	a	Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia.
9397	1	a	MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan.
9398	1	a	PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise.
9399	1	a	Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min.
9400	1	a	Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec).
9401	1	a	1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired.
9402	1	a	Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day.
9403	1	a	Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made.
9404	1	a	STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed.
9405	1	a	Chest pain did not occur.
9406	1	a	REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.
9407	1	a	Sinus bradycardia 56/min.
9408	1	a	First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
9409	1	a	Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
9410	1	a	However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.
9411	1	a	SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size.
9412	1	a	There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
9413	1	a	The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study.
9414	1	a	Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
9415	1	a	CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.
9416	1	a	The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

9954	1	a	PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
9955	1	a	Reason for visit:
9956	1	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
9957	1	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
9958	1	a	Interval History:
9959	1	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
9960	1	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
9961	1	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
9962	1	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
9963	1	a	She had global hypokinesis.
9964	1	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
9965	1	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
9966	1	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
9967	1	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
9968	1	a	BNP elevated at 500.
9969	1	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
9970	1	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
9971	1	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
9972	1	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
9973	1	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
9974	1	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
9975	1	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
9976	1	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
9977	1	a	Lasix 20mg
9978	1	a	Toprol XL 50mg
9979	1	a	ASA 325mg
9980	1	a	Zestril 20mg
9981	1	a	Lantus 10 units hs
9982	1	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
9983	1	a	Multivitamin
9984	1	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
9985	1	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
9986	1	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

10026	1	a	Impression:
10027	1	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
10028	1	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
10029	1	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
10030	1	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
10031	1	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
10032	1	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
10033	1	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
10034	1	a	She relates that she will call our office.

10111	1	a	According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum.
10112	1	a	No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.
10113	1	a	Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.
10114	1	a	She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.
10115	1	a	This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).
10116	1	a	On interview she is tearful regarding her readmission, stating that she &#8220;tries so hard&#8221; to stay out of the hospital, &#8220;but what am I supposed to do when I am sick?&#8221;

10525	1	a	Dear Dr. Naranjo:
10526	1	a	We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.
10527	1	a	He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.
10528	1	a	In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.
10529	1	a	His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.
10530	1	a	Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.
10531	1	a	The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.
10532	1	a	He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.
10533	1	a	The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.
10534	0	a	He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.
10535	1	a	He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.
10536	1	a	He has had no dermatologic evaluation.
10537	1	a	He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.
10538	1	a	Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.
10539	1	a	Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.
10540	1	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.
10541	1	a	There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.
10542	1	a	Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.
10543	1	a	First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.
10544	1	a	He has an S4 at the left sternal border.
10545	1	a	The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.
10546	1	a	There is no peripheral edema.
10547	1	a	Peripheral pulses are diminished.
10548	1	a	The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.
10549	1	a	There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.
10550	1	a	Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.
10551	1	a	Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.
10552	1	a	This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.
10553	1	a	We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.
10554	1	a	We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.
10555	1	a	Sincerely,

10621	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
10622	1	a	1.
10623	1	a	Annual physical, preventative maintenance.
10624	1	a	The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.
10625	1	a	I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.
10626	1	a	Immunizations are up-to-date.
10627	1	a	He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.
10628	1	a	His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.
10629	1	a	We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.
10630	1	a	Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.
10631	1	a	The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.
10632	1	a	We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.
10633	1	a	2.
10634	3	a	Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
10635	1	a	The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.
10636	1	a	Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.
10637	1	a	I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.
10638	1	a	We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.
10639	1	a	I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.
10640	1	a	3.
10641	1	a	Obesity.
10642	1	a	We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.
10643	3	a	I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.
10644	1	a	4.
10645	1	a	CAD with history of DVT.
10646	1	a	He has had an ICD interrogated recently.
10647	1	a	We will check a lipid panel today.
10648	1	a	We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.

10658	1	a	MRN:  58348900

10660	1	a	Admit Date: 1/21/82
10661	1	a	Consult Date: 1/22/82  
10662	3	a	HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
10663	1	a	She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.
10664	1	a	She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.
10665	1	a	She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.
10666	1	a	There is no operative report from the procedure.
10667	1	a	Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.
10668	1	a	Tissue appeared fairly healthy.
10669	1	a	She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.
10670	1	a	She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.
10671	1	a	She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.

10729	1	a	Right ankle xrays pending (1/21/82)
10730	3	a	Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
10731	1	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
10732	1	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
10733	1	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
10734	1	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
10735	1	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
10736	1	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
10737	1	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
10738	1	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
10739	1	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results
10740	1	a	Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose
10741	1	a	Please obtain LFTs

11117	1	a	Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
11118	1	a	Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
11119	1	a	A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 
11120	1	a	""" Hematoma around right subclavian artery."
11121	1	a	Narrowing of the artery.
11122	1	a	Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.
11123	1	a	"If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained."""
11124	1	a	On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
11125	1	a	His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses.
11126	1	a	There are no thrills or bruits.
11127	1	a	My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:
11128	1	a	1).
11129	1	a	Hematoma- to be expected
11130	1	a	2).
11131	1	a	Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
11132	1	a	3).
11133	1	a	Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
11134	1	a	4).
11135	1	a	Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
11136	1	a	Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
11137	1	a	This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
11138	1	a	If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it.
11139	1	a	He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
11140	1	a	There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

12359	1	a	Dear Dr Chavez,
12360	1	a	Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.
12361	1	a	He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home.
12362	1	a	He has not sustained any significant injuries.
12363	1	a	He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.
12364	1	a	Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.
12365	1	a	Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.
12366	1	a	He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.
12367	1	a	Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.
12368	1	a	Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet.
12369	1	a	Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.
12370	1	a	Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.
12371	1	a	This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162.
12372	1	a	This most likely is a MGUS.
12373	3	a	Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.
12374	1	a	The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.
12375	1	a	Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.
12376	1	a	He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.
12377	1	a	I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control.
12378	1	a	Follow-up in 6 months
12379	1	a	Sincerely,

12492	1	a	Cardiomegaly.
12493	1	a	&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis.
12494	1	a	Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT
12495	1	a	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.
12496	1	a	Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.
12497	1	a	Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.
12498	1	a	I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.
12499	1	a	His murmur is quite impressive.
12500	1	a	Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
12501	1	a	Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors.
12502	1	a	He is also a smoker.
12503	3	a	Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.
12504	1	a	1.
12505	1	a	CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.
12506	1	a	Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.
12507	1	a	Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.
12508	1	a	Repeat echo in the am.
12509	1	a	Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.

12620	1	a	At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
12621	1	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
12622	1	a	He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.
12623	1	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
12624	1	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
12625	1	a	Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.
12626	1	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
12627	1	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
12628	1	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
12629	1	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
12630	1	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
12631	1	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
12632	1	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.
12633	1	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
12634	1	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
12635	1	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
12636	1	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
12637	1	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
12638	1	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
12639	1	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
12640	1	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
12641	1	a	He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.
12642	1	a	His energy has been good.
12643	1	a	He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.
12644	1	a	No bleeding/bruising.
12645	1	a	No further swelling in his arms/legs.
12646	1	a	He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.
12647	1	a	Problems/PMH:

12692	1	a	Assessment and Plan:
12693	1	a	Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
12694	1	a	He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
12695	1	a	Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.
12696	1	a	It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
12697	1	a	At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.
12698	1	a	If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.
12699	1	a	At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.
12700	1	a	If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.
12701	1	a	Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.
12702	1	a	In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

12973	1	a	Impression
12974	3	a	My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W.
12975	1	a	"She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother"" coverage"
12976	1	a	Recommendation
12977	1	a	My recommendations are:
12978	1	a	1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO
12979	1	a	2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO
12980	1	a	3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

13343	1	a	   MRN: 2474410
13344	1	a	   DOB: 8/6/2075
13345	1	a	Dear Dr. Keller,
13346	1	a	Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
13347	1	a	Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
13348	1	a	We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
13349	1	a	"HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband."
13350	1	a	This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.
13351	1	a	She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
13352	1	a	In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
13353	1	a	The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.
13354	1	a	In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.
13355	1	a	She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.
13356	1	a	She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.
13357	1	a	She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.
13358	1	a	The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.
13359	1	a	She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.
13360	0	a	Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.
13361	1	a	CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
13362	1	a	She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.
13363	1	a	Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.
13364	1	a	She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.
13365	1	a	ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
13366	1	a	Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).
13367	1	a	She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.
13368	1	a	Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.
13369	1	a	In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.
13370	1	a	Past Medical History: 
13371	1	a	CAD s/p LAD stent 2144
13372	1	a	HTN

13441	1	a	MRI Brain: No evidence of acute infarct, partially empty sella, nonspecific periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensities consistent with small vessel disease.
13442	1	a	Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.
13443	1	a	Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.
13444	1	a	At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
13445	1	a	Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.
13446	1	a	We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.
13447	1	a	She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.
13448	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

13479	1	a	He presented 
13480	1	a	this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 
13481	1	a	believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 
13482	1	a	was sitting on the sofa and got up.
13483	1	a	He has been leaking 
13484	1	a	serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.

13778	1	a	MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  
13779	1	a	CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.
13780	3	a	IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP.
13781	1	a	His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
13782	1	a	His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke.
13783	1	a	The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification.
13784	1	a	Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis.
13785	1	a	Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely.
13786	1	a	Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported.
13787	3	a	The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP.
13788	1	a	The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.

13817	1	a	HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia.
13818	1	a	The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks.
13819	1	a	He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose.
13820	1	a	He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers.
13821	1	a	His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts.
13822	1	a	At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home.
13823	1	a	He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better.
13824	1	a	His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia.
13825	1	a	He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.
13826	1	a	On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC.
13827	1	a	He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor.
13828	1	a	Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress.
13829	1	a	In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness.
13830	1	a	He has had less appetite recently.
13831	1	a	He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks.

14236	1	a	While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.
14237	1	a	CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.
14238	1	a	If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent.

14351	1	a	   A 74 yo man with a long history of CAD eventually necessitating CABG in 4/2161.
14352	1	a	He has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.
14353	1	a	His last CV evaluation was an Adenosine PET in 4/63 which showed an EF 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.
14354	1	a	These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).
14355	1	a	His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.
14356	1	a	He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).
14357	1	a	He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.
14358	1	a	His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.
14359	1	a	He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.
14360	1	a	He denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.
14361	1	a	Someone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.
14362	1	a	Past medical history:
14363	1	a	   CAD with CABG in 4/61, LIMA to LAD, V to RCA PLVB, V to OM  -- he has an unbypassed occluded Diagonal with collaterals from the OM

14436	1	a	"			Assessment and plan:"
14437	1	a	   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.
14438	1	a	His chest pain syndromes have resolved.
14439	1	a	He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.
14440	1	a	This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.
14441	1	a	CV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.
14442	1	a	Plan.
14443	1	a	1.
14444	1	a	CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.
14445	1	a	He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).
14446	1	a	2.
14447	1	a	LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.
14448	1	a	3.
14449	3	a	DM-followed by Dr. Orton.
14450	1	a	Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0
14451	1	a	4.
14452	1	a	Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.
14453	1	a	Continue to Rx risk factors.
14454	1	a	5.
14455	1	a	Lipids-look great today.
14456	1	a	Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!
14457	1	a	We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.
14458	1	a	6.
14459	1	a	HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.
14460	1	a	I am trying to get him on an ARB again.
14461	1	a	Diovan at 80 a day.
14462	1	a	He will get f/u labs in one month

14491	1	a	CC: Chest Pain    Cath    VF arrest    RCA stenting
14492	3	a	History of Present Illness (obtained on admission):  Pt is a 48 yo male with h/o DMII, hypercholesterolemia, Bipolar d/o, and depression who began to have sub-sternal day prior to admission in car and pre-syncope + profound weakness.
14493	1	a	This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.
14494	1	a	He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.
14495	1	a	His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL.
14496	1	a	His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.
14497	1	a	Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.
14498	1	a	Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.
14499	1	a	During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.
14500	1	a	Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR.
14501	1	a	Pt was started on amio.
14502	1	a	Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.
14503	1	a	POBA was done to ostial PDA.
14504	1	a	A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.
14505	1	a	On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).
14506	1	a	He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.
14507	1	a	His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.

15145	1	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
15146	1	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
15147	1	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
15148	3	a	Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
15149	1	a	She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.
15150	1	a	This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.
15151	1	a	Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
15152	1	a	Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.
15153	1	a	Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
15154	1	a	She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.
15155	1	a	She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.
15156	1	a	Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.
15157	1	a	She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.
15158	1	a	Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.
15159	1	a	Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
15160	1	a	Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
15161	1	a	However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.
15162	1	a	She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.
15163	1	a	She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.
15164	1	a	She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.
15165	1	a	She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.
15166	1	a	She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
15167	1	a	"She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

15235	1	a	Studies: 
15236	1	a	CTA head (5/01/90): No significant interval change in the distal left A2 segment aneurysm.
15237	1	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
15238	3	a	58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
15239	1	a	She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.
15240	1	a	We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
15241	1	a	The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.
15242	1	a	If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.
15243	3	a	However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.
15244	1	a	Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.
15245	1	a	Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
15246	1	a	Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.
15247	1	a	I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.
15248	1	a	She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
15249	1	a	If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.
15250	1	a	Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.
15251	1	a	Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.
15252	1	a	Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
15253	1	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
15254	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
15255	1	a	I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.
15256	1	a	Sincerely,

15737	1	a	History of present illness   70y/o F who presented in late May with daily fever x 2-3 months with low back pain x 2 weeks, admitted May 30 and found to have small gram negative rod bacteremia consistent with Brucellosis, which fits with her epidemiologic exposure to unpasteurized camels milk and her prolonged fever.
15738	1	a	There was initial concern for TB, but she ruled out for pulmonary tb with 3 negative smears.
15739	1	a	PPD positive.
15740	1	a	She had an MRI of her spine that was initially read as L5/S1 diskitis/osteomyelitis with right paraspinal phlegmon .
15741	1	a	MSK radiologists felt that this actually represented degenerative change with no evidence of infection, with explanation that a large right-sided osteophyte is causing irritation.
15742	1	a	Mrs. Iles declined a TEE on during her admission.

16207	1	a	HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
16208	1	a	who presents for routine follow up.
16209	1	a	CURRENT ISSUES:
16210	1	a	1.
16211	3	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
16212	1	a	The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
16213	0	a	     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.
16214	1	a	We discussed 
16215	1	a	     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
16216	1	a	     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
16217	1	a	     tighter control.
16218	1	a	He states he has been following his finger 
16219	1	a	     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this.
16220	1	a	His 
16221	1	a	     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
16222	1	a	     regular.
16223	1	a	At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
16224	1	a	     regular at dinnertime.
16225	1	a	He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
16226	1	a	2.
16227	1	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
16228	1	a	Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
16229	1	a	     rash to his simvastatin.
16230	1	a	This resolved on the discontinuation of 
16231	1	a	     the simvastatin.
16232	1	a	Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
16233	1	a	     January, 2067.
16234	1	a	He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
16235	1	a	     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
16236	1	a	     fats.
16237	1	a	3.
16238	1	a	Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
16239	1	a	The 
16240	1	a	     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
16241	1	a	     Jobst stocking.
16242	1	a	He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
16243	1	a	     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
16244	1	a	     compliant with the stocking.
16245	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.
16246	1	a	Heart rate:  76.
16247	1	a	Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.
16248	1	a	Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
16249	1	a	rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
16250	1	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
16251	1	a	Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.
16252	1	a	Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.
16253	1	a	There is 1+ pedal edema of 
16254	1	a	the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.
16255	1	a	Foot 
16256	1	a	care remains excellent.
16257	1	a	IMPRESSION:                         
16258	1	a	We will increase the patient's 
16259	1	a	     morning NPH dose to 40 units.
16260	1	a	He will once again try to become 
16261	1	a	     more compliant with his diet.
16262	1	a	He will be scheduled for a follow up 
16263	1	a	     ophthalmologic examination.
16264	1	a	We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
16265	1	a	     his recent rash to simvastin.
16266	1	a	We will re-check a fasting lipid 
16267	1	a	     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

16452	1	a	Patient Name: NARVAEZ, OTIS;  MRN: 6680255
16453	1	a	Dictated at: 01/25/72 by HOLLAND KELLER, M.D.
16454	1	a	PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
16455	1	a	Dr. Hayden Avery 
16456	1	a	REFERRAL SOURCE:  
16457	1	a	Above.
16458	1	a	CONSULTATION REPLY 
16459	1	a	Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.
16460	1	a	I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.
16461	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.
16462	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.
16463	1	a	He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.
16464	1	a	If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.
16465	1	a	This is relieved by sitting.
16466	1	a	It will happen when walking as well.
16467	1	a	This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
16468	1	a	He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.
16469	1	a	Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.
16470	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.
16471	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.
16472	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.
16473	1	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s.
16474	1	a	and Selexa.
16475	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.
16476	1	a	BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.
16477	1	a	EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.
16478	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.
16479	1	a	He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.
16480	1	a	He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.
16481	1	a	He has no HIV risk factors.
16482	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.
16483	1	a	He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.
16484	1	a	He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.
16485	1	a	When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.
16486	1	a	There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.
16487	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.
16488	1	a	Pulse of 60 and regular.
16489	1	a	Carotids 2+ without bruits.
16490	1	a	Mental status:  Unremarkable.
16491	1	a	Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.
16492	1	a	No evidence of retinopathy.
16493	1	a	Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.
16494	1	a	Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
16495	1	a	Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
16496	1	a	Rapid alternating movements intact.
16497	1	a	Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
16498	1	a	Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
16499	1	a	The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.
16500	1	a	Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.
16501	1	a	Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.
16502	1	a	He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.
16503	1	a	He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.
16504	1	a	DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
16505	1	a	Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
16506	1	a	The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
16507	1	a	ASSESSMENT:  
16508	1	a	1.
16509	1	a	Neuropathy.
16510	1	a	The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
16511	1	a	He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
16512	1	a	He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.
16513	1	a	There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
16514	1	a	I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.
16515	1	a	I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
16516	1	a	He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
16517	1	a	I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
16518	1	a	Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.
16519	1	a	The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
16520	1	a	DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

16527	1	a	NEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE 
16528	1	a	PATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes
16529	1	a	MRN: 78361343
16530	1	a	DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04
16531	1	a	Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness
16532	1	a	HPI:   
16533	1	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
16534	1	a	Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note).
16535	1	a	Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.
16536	1	a	She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months.
16537	1	a	Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly.
16538	1	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
16539	1	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
16540	1	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
16541	1	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
16542	1	a	She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
16543	1	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
16544	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
16545	1	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
16546	1	a	CSF ACE was normal.
16547	1	a	Cultures were negative.
16548	1	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
16549	1	a	She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily.
16550	1	a	In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
16551	1	a	This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin.
16552	1	a	Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.
16553	1	a	Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance.
16554	1	a	Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls.
16555	1	a	Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down.
16556	1	a	Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused.
16557	1	a	She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom.
16558	1	a	It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days.
16559	1	a	Patient reports intermittent headaches.
16560	1	a	On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities.
16561	1	a	ROS: 
16562	1	a	Reliability of ROS is questionable.
16563	1	a	Neurologic: Except as above, there have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, speaking, language, swallowing, or gait.

16660	1	a	There is no hydrocephalus.
16661	1	a	Chronic periventricular white matter changes are again noted.
16662	1	a	There is no significant soft tissue swelling or calvarial fracture.
16663	1	a	Prominent calcifications of a falx cerebri are incidentally noted.
16664	1	a	Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
16665	1	a	There is bilateral exophthalmus.
16666	1	a	CXR: today
16667	1	a	Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia.
16668	1	a	Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.
16669	1	a	EKG: sinus tachy.
16670	1	a	no ST changes or Q waves.
16671	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
16672	1	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
16673	1	a	Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.
16674	1	a	Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities.
16675	1	a	Head CT unremarkable.
16676	1	a	Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid.
16677	1	a	She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP.
16678	1	a	She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.
16679	1	a	This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
16680	1	a	CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.
16681	1	a	-check her gait
16682	1	a	-check ESR
16683	1	a	-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
16684	1	a	-MRI of the brain
16685	1	a	-EEG
16686	1	a	-further lab w/u pending LP results
16687	1	a	-remove foley catheter
16688	1	a	-PT consult

16931	1	a	PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.
16932	1	a	We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.
16933	1	a	Will check ESR today.
16934	1	a	Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.
16935	1	a	Depression:  She seems better.
16936	1	a	Continue Effexor.
16937	1	a	Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.
16938	1	a	Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.
16939	1	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.
16940	1	a	Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.
16941	1	a	Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.
16942	1	a	Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
16943	1	a	Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
16944	1	a	Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
16945	1	a	Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
16946	3	a	DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
16947	1	a	Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
16948	1	a	Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
16949	1	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
16950	1	a	Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.
16951	1	a	11.
16952	1	a	Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

16962	1	a	Re:  Dalila Haynes
16963	1	a	       783-61-34-3
16964	1	a	Dear Dr. Kay: 
16965	1	a	I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
16966	1	a	She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
16967	1	a	I will review her history for the record.
16968	1	a	She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.
16969	1	a	Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
16970	1	a	Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.
16971	1	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
16972	1	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
16973	1	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
16974	1	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
16975	1	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
16976	1	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
16977	1	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
16978	1	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
16979	1	a	CSF ACE was normal.
16980	1	a	Cultures were negative.
16981	1	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
16982	1	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
16983	1	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
16984	1	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
16985	1	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
16986	1	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
16987	1	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
16988	1	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
16989	1	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
16990	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
16991	1	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
16992	1	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
16993	1	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
16994	1	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
16995	1	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
16996	3	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
16997	1	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
16998	1	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
16999	1	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
17000	1	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
17001	1	a	There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
17002	1	a	She is a widow.
17003	1	a	She has four children.
17004	1	a	She used to work for Lowe's.
17005	1	a	She now lives with a daughter.
17006	1	a	She has had no recent fever or chills.
17007	1	a	Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
17008	1	a	There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
17009	1	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
17010	1	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
17011	1	a	Pulse 126, regular.
17012	1	a	BP 126/66.
17013	1	a	She is obese.
17014	1	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
17015	1	a	There are no cranial bruits.
17016	1	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
17017	1	a	There are wheezes bilaterally.
17018	1	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
17019	1	a	The abdomen is benign.
17020	1	a	The extremities are normal.
17021	1	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
17022	1	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
17023	1	a	She is oriented to place.
17024	1	a	She is inattentive.
17025	1	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
17026	1	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
17027	1	a	There is no aphasia.
17028	1	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
17029	1	a	The visual fields are full.
17030	1	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
17031	1	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
17032	1	a	.
17033	1	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
17034	1	a	Facial sensation is intact.
17035	1	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
17036	1	a	Hearing is grossly intact.
17037	1	a	Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
17038	1	a	The palate elevates normal.
17039	1	a	Gag is present.
17040	1	a	The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
17041	1	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
17042	1	a	Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.
17043	1	a	There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.
17044	1	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
17045	1	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
17046	1	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
17047	1	a	Coordination is intact.
17048	1	a	Romberg is negative.
17049	1	a	Gait and station are normal.
17050	1	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
17051	1	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
17052	1	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
17053	1	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
17054	1	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
17055	1	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
17056	1	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
17057	1	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
17058	1	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
17059	1	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
17060	1	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
17061	1	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
17062	1	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
17063	1	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
17064	1	a	Thank you for this consultation.
17065	1	a	Sincerely,
17066	1	a	Keondre Viera, M.D.

17299	1	a	 Attending Note
17300	1	a	I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.
17301	1	a	I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.
17302	3	a	The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.
17303	1	a	Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.
17304	1	a	CTA was also normal.
17305	1	a	He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past.
17306	1	a	Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.
17307	1	a	His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.
17308	1	a	It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;
17309	1	a	The exam today showed:
17310	1	a	Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
17311	1	a	Left APD
17312	1	a	Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
17313	1	a	Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.
17314	1	a	Was not in UMN fashion.
17315	1	a	Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.
17316	1	a	Assessment:  
17317	1	a	Status post TIA possibly related to AF
17318	1	a	Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
17319	1	a	The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
17320	1	a	Plan:
17321	1	a	Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
17322	1	a	Continue 
17323	1	a	ASA and coumadin and statin
17324	3	a	Continued HTN and DM control
17325	1	a	Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy
17326	1	a	Return in 6 months.

17730	1	a	Reason for visit:
17731	1	a	   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest
17732	1	a	Interval History:
17733	1	a	   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today.
17734	1	a	His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test.
17735	1	a	He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.
17736	1	a	His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia.
17737	1	a	He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.
17738	1	a	Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.
17739	1	a	Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.
17740	1	a	"He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol."
17741	1	a	The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week.
17742	1	a	He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different.
17743	1	a	He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.
17744	1	a	He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.
17745	1	a	Past medical history:
17746	3	a	   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT

17771	1	a	   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB.
17772	1	a	Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.
17773	1	a	Assessment and plan:
17774	1	a	   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath.
17775	1	a	I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise.
17776	1	a	We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.
17777	1	a	We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.
17778	1	a	The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

18763	3	a	A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.
18764	1	a	She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.
18765	1	a	This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.
18766	1	a	Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.
18767	1	a	In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.
18768	1	a	Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
18769	1	a	Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.
18770	1	a	Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.
18771	1	a	Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.
18772	1	a	Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.
18773	1	a	Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.
18774	1	a	However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.
18775	1	a	She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
18776	1	a	She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.
18777	1	a	Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.
18778	1	a	Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.
18779	1	a	However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.
18780	1	a	The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.
18781	1	a	Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.
18782	1	a	There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
18783	1	a	There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state
18784	1	a	Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.
18785	1	a	She had a recent stress test that was negative.
18786	1	a	However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.
18787	1	a	However, this would not cause the delirium.
18788	1	a	Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.
18789	1	a	Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.
18790	3	a	Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.
18791	1	a	Plan:
18792	1	a	Delirium:  
18793	1	a	500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1/2NS at 80cc/hr.
18794	1	a	TSH, B12, Folate, RPR, ESR.
18795	1	a	D/C her HCTZ, Avapro, Atenolol and recheck her lytes in the AM.
18796	1	a	Call PROMPTCARE in AM for consult re the d/c of Diamox.
18797	1	a	Seroquel 12.5 mg overnight.
18798	1	a	Renal failure:
18799	1	a	"	likely pre-renal given FeNa<2% and response to fluids in ED"
18800	1	a	"	continue gentle hydration"

18821	1	a	Pt seen and examined with Gary Aragon, agree with assessment and plan.
18822	1	a	In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium.
18823	1	a	Etiology likely multifactorial, however, diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium.
18824	1	a	Will pursue broad differential as outlined above.

19341	1	a	Post, IN  86454
19342	1	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
19343	1	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
19344	1	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
19345	1	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
19346	1	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
19347	0	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
19348	1	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
19349	1	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
19350	1	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
19351	1	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
19352	1	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
19353	1	a	daily lifelong.
19354	1	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
19355	1	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
19356	1	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
19357	1	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
19358	1	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
19359	1	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
19360	1	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
19361	1	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
19362	1	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
19363	1	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
19364	1	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
19365	1	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
19366	1	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
19367	1	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
19368	1	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
19369	1	a	b.i.d.
19370	1	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
19371	1	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
19372	1	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
19373	1	a	There are no bruits.
19374	1	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
19375	1	a	He was not clubbed.
19376	1	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
19377	1	a	He had no peripheral edema.
19378	1	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
19379	1	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
19380	1	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
19381	1	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
19382	1	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
19383	1	a	TSH was also normal.
19384	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
19385	1	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
19386	1	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
19387	1	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
19388	3	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
19389	1	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
19390	1	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
19391	1	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
19392	1	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
19393	1	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
19394	1	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
19395	1	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
19396	1	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
19397	1	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
19398	1	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
19399	1	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
19400	1	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
19401	1	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
19402	1	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
19403	1	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
19404	1	a	Yours sincerely,

19481	1	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
19482	1	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
19483	1	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
19484	1	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
19485	1	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
19486	3	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
19487	1	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
19488	1	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
19489	1	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
19490	1	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
19491	1	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
19492	1	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
19493	1	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
19494	1	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
19495	1	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
19496	1	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
19497	1	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
19498	1	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
19499	1	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
19500	1	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
19501	1	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
19502	1	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
19503	1	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
19504	1	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
19505	1	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
19506	1	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
19507	1	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
19508	1	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
19509	1	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
19510	1	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
19511	1	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
19512	1	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
19513	1	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
19514	1	a	Chest is clear.
19515	1	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
19516	1	a	PMI is normal.
19517	1	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
19518	1	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
19519	1	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
19520	1	a	The abdomen is obese.
19521	1	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
19522	1	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
19523	1	a	Distal pulses are normal.
19524	1	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
19525	1	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
19526	1	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
19527	1	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
19528	1	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
19529	1	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
19530	1	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
19531	1	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
19532	1	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
19533	1	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
19534	1	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
19535	1	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
19536	1	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
19537	1	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
19538	1	a	Kindest personal regards.

19558	3	a	IDENTIFICATION:  A 71-year-old woman who presents to follow up diabetes.
19559	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I received the patient's recent blood work and asked her to come in for a short-term followup.
19560	0	a	Her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1.
19561	1	a	We discussed her current system for managing her blood sugar.

19591	1	a	Vital Signs
19592	1	a	BP 126/68 L Arm, P 69, Temp 98.0, Wt 235.0 lb
19593	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.
19594	1	a	Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.
19595	1	a	Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.
19596	1	a	Lungs:  Clear.
19597	1	a	Cardiac:  Regular.
19598	1	a	Extremities:  Trace edema.
19599	3	a	ASSESSMENT:  Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes.
19600	1	a	Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems.
19601	1	a	She does use Valley Hospital Web Services.
19602	1	a	We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin.
19603	1	a	We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now.
19604	1	a	We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense.
19605	1	a	She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal.
19606	1	a	I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.
19607	1	a	I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.
19608	1	a	She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.
19609	1	a	She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.
19610	1	a	I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start.
19611	1	a	She will check a fasting fingerstick.
19612	1	a	She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day.
19613	1	a	She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal.
19614	1	a	She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed.
19615	1	a	She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time.
19616	1	a	We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment.
19617	1	a	Her last LDL was over 100.
19618	1	a	I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin.
19619	1	a	I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated.
19620	1	a	Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable.
19621	1	a	I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now.
19622	1	a	Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.
19623	1	a	We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.

19632	1	a	Patient:  Eubanks, Larry
19633	1	a	MRN:  7744323
19634	1	a	DOB:    10/03/2080
19635	1	a	Admit Date:  01/10/49
19636	1	a	"PCP:  Talbert, Nicholas	(783)508-2821"
19637	1	a	Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital
19638	1	a	CC:  chest pain
19639	1	a	HPI:
19640	3	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.
19641	3	a	In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.
19642	1	a	He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.
19643	1	a	Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.
19644	1	a	The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.
19645	1	a	On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.
19646	1	a	Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.
19647	1	a	A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
19648	1	a	Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.
19649	1	a	His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
19650	3	a	Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
19651	1	a	He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
19652	1	a	Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.
19653	1	a	These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.
19654	1	a	The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.
19655	1	a	His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
19656	1	a	He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
19657	1	a	Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.
19658	1	a	The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.
19659	1	a	Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.
19660	1	a	The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.
19661	1	a	In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.
19662	1	a	EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
19663	1	a	Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.
19664	1	a	A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.
19665	1	a	CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.
19666	1	a	Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.

19759	1	a	Choelithiasis without cholecystitis.
19760	1	a	Punctate calcification in the left kidney, without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis, likely vascular, though renal calculus is possible.
19761	1	a	Assessment:
19762	3	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.
19763	1	a	The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.
19764	1	a	The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.
19765	1	a	The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.
19766	1	a	The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.
19767	1	a	In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.
19768	1	a	The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.
19769	1	a	Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.
19770	1	a	This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.
19771	1	a	EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.
19772	1	a	The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.
19773	1	a	The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.
19774	1	a	The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.
19775	1	a	Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.
19776	1	a	Plan:  
19777	1	a	1.
19778	1	a	Chest pain
19779	1	a	Telemetry, cardiac monitor

19816	1	a	Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
19817	3	a	In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms.
19818	1	a	He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time.
19819	1	a	The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
19820	1	a	Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week.
19821	1	a	He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema.
19822	1	a	He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
19823	1	a	He does not know the details of the workup.
19824	1	a	Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65.
19825	1	a	He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
19826	1	a	In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro.
19827	1	a	HR was 85 and BP 135/82.
19828	1	a	He was given ASA and a BB.
19829	1	a	Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6.
19830	1	a	Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6.
19831	1	a	There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
19832	1	a	He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44).
19833	1	a	A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
19834	1	a	(the ddimer was elevated).
19835	1	a	His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
19836	1	a	On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free.
19837	1	a	Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema.
19838	1	a	ASA and BB were cont.
19839	1	a	The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
19840	1	a	However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead.
19841	1	a	This is planned for this morning.
19842	1	a	Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

19910	1	a	alkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin
19911	1	a	3.6.
19912	1	a	Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C
19913	1	a	antibody with normal LFT's.
19914	1	a	Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA
19915	1	a	level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the
19916	1	a	lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody
19917	1	a	positive.
19918	1	a	If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than
19919	1	a	she requires no further workup.
19920	1	a	However, if she is RNA positive
19921	1	a	than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of
19922	1	a	inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for
19923	1	a	treatment with interferon/ribavirin.
19924	1	a	She is amenable to this and
19925	1	a	we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of
19926	1	a	her RNA test.

19944	1	a	     MR #236-67-03-3
19945	1	a	Dear Dr. Ventura:
19946	1	a	Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.
19947	1	a	This patient
19948	3	a	with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
19949	1	a	on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.
19950	1	a	She has been doing well
19951	1	a	except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
19952	1	a	the past week.
19953	1	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
19954	1	a	pain.
19955	1	a	She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.
19956	1	a	Her blood
19957	1	a	sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.
19958	1	a	Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
19959	1	a	Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
19960	1	a	NPH 10 units qam.
19961	1	a	On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
19962	1	a	dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.
19963	1	a	CBC at the time
19964	1	a	revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.
19965	1	a	Blood
19966	1	a	cultures were sent.
19967	1	a	On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
19968	1	a	and a pulse of 88.
19969	1	a	She was afebrile.
19970	1	a	Head and neck examination
19971	1	a	was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.
19972	1	a	On cardiovascular
19973	1	a	examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
19974	1	a	peripheral edema.
19975	1	a	Heart sounds were normal.
19976	1	a	Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
19977	1	a	protein and 2+ glucose.
19978	1	a	Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center.
19979	1	a	There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection.
19980	1	a	She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
19981	1	a	tract infection.
19982	1	a	Because of her early satiety she has been
19983	1	a	eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
19984	1	a	gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

20005	1	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
20006	1	a	     MR #453-39-84-4
20007	1	a	Dear Dr.
20008	1	a	Craft:
20009	1	a	I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.
20010	1	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
20011	1	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
20012	1	a	The patient does relate that
20013	1	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
20014	1	a	worse several years ago.
20015	1	a	However, with the treatment of his
20016	1	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
20017	1	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
20018	1	a	Since that
20019	1	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
20020	1	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
20021	1	a	At the same
20022	1	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
20023	1	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
20024	1	a	Lasix.
20025	1	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
20026	1	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
20027	1	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
20028	1	a	At the current time,
20029	1	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
20030	1	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
20031	1	a	months ago.
20032	1	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
20033	1	a	supplemental oxygen.
20034	1	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
20035	1	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
20036	1	a	coughing.
20037	3	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
20038	1	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
20039	1	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
20040	1	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
20041	1	a	upper GI bleed.
20042	1	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70
20043	1	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
20044	1	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
20045	1	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
20046	1	a	He has no known drug allergies.
20047	1	a	He discontinued cigarette
20048	1	a	smoking years ago.
20049	1	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
20050	1	a	His pulse was
20051	1	a	56, afebrile.
20052	1	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
20053	1	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
20054	1	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
20055	1	a	He is in no
20056	1	a	respiratory distress at rest.
20057	1	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
20058	1	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
20059	1	a	His neck had no
20060	1	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
20061	1	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
20062	1	a	left base with crackles.
20063	1	a	His right lung was clear.
20064	1	a	His heart
20065	1	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
20066	1	a	murmur.
20067	1	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
20068	1	a	His
20069	1	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
20070	1	a	Pulmonary
20071	1	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
20072	1	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
20073	1	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
20074	1	a	His current
20075	1	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
20076	1	a	December.
20077	1	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
20078	1	a	I took Mr. Joshi
20079	1	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
20080	1	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
20081	1	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
20082	1	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
20083	1	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
20084	1	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
20085	1	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
20086	1	a	Mr. Joshi had several
20087	1	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
20088	1	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
20089	1	a	I do
20090	1	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
20091	1	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
20092	1	a	I do recommend that he get
20093	1	a	daily exercise.
20094	1	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
20095	1	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
20096	1	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
20097	1	a	I have also
20098	1	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
20099	1	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
20100	1	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
20101	1	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
20102	1	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary 
20103	1	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70
20104	1	a	vascular disease.
20105	1	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
20106	1	a	his initial work-up.
20107	1	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
20108	1	a	patient.
20109	1	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to
20110	1	a	call.

20276	1	a	The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation
20277	1	a	reviewed by me and I concur.
20278	1	a	In addition, I personally
20279	1	a	interviewed and examined this patient.
20280	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who
20281	1	a	presents for evaluation of chest pain.
20282	1	a	The patient had no
20283	1	a	history of coronary artery disease until the last week.
20284	1	a	She was
20285	1	a	apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.
20286	1	a	She
20287	1	a	had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort.
20288	1	a	She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums.
20289	1	a	After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the
20290	1	a	discomfort was not improving.
20291	1	a	She did feel like that she had
20292	1	a	less energy for her usual activity.
20293	1	a	She went to a hospital there
20294	1	a	in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive
20295	1	a	troponin.
20296	1	a	She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did
20297	1	a	show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.
20298	1	a	She subsequently
20299	1	a	underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.
20300	1	a	She did
20301	1	a	have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was
20302	1	a	much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.
20303	1	a	told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.
20304	1	a	She returned home today, called her primary care physician and
20305	1	a	was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation.
20306	1	a	She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania
20307	1	a	earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more
20308	1	a	severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat
20309	1	a	more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing
20310	1	a	before.
20311	1	a	It is not always associated with exertion.
20312	1	a	It sometimes
20313	1	a	radiates to her left shoulder.
20314	1	a	It is not pleuritic in nature.
20315	1	a	It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level
20316	1	a	of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her
20317	1	a	discharge from Pennsylvania.
20318	1	a	She denies any shortness of breath.
20319	1	a	is able to lie flat.
20320	1	a	Denies any lower extremity edema.

20489	1	a	Impression by problem:
20490	1	a	Left vertebral stenosis:  Patient has not had recurrent symptoms since her CVA in 2083 and she is neurologically intact by my neuro exam.
20491	1	a	She is therapeutic on her coumadin.
20492	1	a	She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).
20493	1	a	Hypertension:  Patient is quite hypertensive (170/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd.
20494	1	a	Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd.
20495	1	a	She does not complain of any side effects from her medications.
20496	1	a	She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.
20497	3	a	Diabetes Mellitus
20498	1	a	Ms. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home.
20499	1	a	She has had a little polydipsia/polyuria.
20500	1	a	Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level.

20521	1	a	"Patient: VAUGHN, FRANK			MANAMANA MRN: 6767510"
20522	1	a	"Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU"
20523	3	a	CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management
20524	3	a	HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.
20525	1	a	He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.
20526	1	a	He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.
20527	1	a	He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.
20528	1	a	He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.
20529	1	a	He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.
20530	1	a	Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.
20531	1	a	On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.
20532	1	a	On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.
20533	1	a	In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.
20534	1	a	On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.
20535	1	a	His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.
20536	1	a	An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.
20537	1	a	The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.
20538	1	a	He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.
20539	3	a	In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.
20540	1	a	"At the time he was feeling ""lousy,"" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376."
20541	1	a	Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.
20542	1	a	He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.
20543	1	a	Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).
20544	1	a	He has microalbuminuria.
20545	1	a	He is unable to give me a full history.
20546	1	a	In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.
20547	1	a	He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

20629	3	a	Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.
20630	1	a	Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.
20631	1	a	Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.
20632	1	a	Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.
20633	1	a	Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.
20634	1	a	Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.
20635	1	a	Recommend:
20636	1	a	Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
20637	1	a	Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
20638	1	a	Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
20639	1	a	Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g.
20640	1	a	Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
20641	1	a	Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves
20642	1	a	Thank you for interesting consult

20650	1	a	History of present illness   This is a 54-year-old white male here complaining persistent cough.
20651	1	a	He has had a dry cough for about two months.
20652	1	a	He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.
20653	1	a	The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.
20654	1	a	He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.
20655	1	a	He is a nonsmoker.
20656	1	a	About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.
20657	1	a	He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.
20658	1	a	In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.
20659	1	a	He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.
20660	1	a	He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.
20661	1	a	Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.
20662	1	a	No orthopnea or PND.
20663	1	a	He still has a dry cough.

20716	1	a	HPI:  Ms Rivers was in her USOH until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at ViewSonic.
20717	1	a	She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.
20718	1	a	However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.
20719	1	a	She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).
20720	1	a	She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.
20721	1	a	When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.
20722	1	a	This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.
20723	1	a	She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.
20724	1	a	When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.
20725	1	a	When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.
20726	1	a	She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.
20727	1	a	Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.
20728	1	a	She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.
20729	1	a	She had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.
20730	1	a	She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.
20731	1	a	She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.

21021	1	a	SOB: 
21022	1	a	Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.
21023	1	a	Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales 
21024	1	a	make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.
21025	1	a	Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans 
21026	1	a	and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.
21027	1	a	Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
21028	1	a	&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)
21029	1	a	&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers
21030	1	a	&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
21031	1	a	&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.
21032	1	a	I would also screen her for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.
21033	1	a	RENAL TX:  Cr only mildly above baseline.
21034	1	a	Hopefully won&#8217;t worsen w/ lasix.

21038	1	a	HTN:  Poorly controlled.
21039	1	a	It&#8217;s partly worsenend by her anxiety.
21040	1	a	&#224;ativan 0.5 mg iv q 8 hrs prn anxiety
21041	1	a	&#224;Labetolol 20 mg IV and start labetolol 100 mg po bid (bblocker effect will slow HR and help flash pulm edema from diastolic dyfct, the combined alpha and beta blockade will give it added efficacy given the severity of her HTN, Norvasc may not be ideal given her LE edema).
21042	1	a	??
21043	3	a	?DM:  pt on metformin for &#8220;diabetes prevention.&#8221;  Metformin is contraindicated for Cr greater then or equal to 1.4 in a female pt.

21366	1	a	Renal Attending: Dr. Judge
21367	1	a	"Admission Date: 4/24/2098			Consultation Date: 4/24/2098"
21368	1	a	Reason for Consultation: 
21369	1	a	Progressive renal impairment.
21370	1	a	Creat rose from 1.6 (Nov 97) to 4.07 (may 98)
21371	1	a	History of Present Illness:
21372	1	a	This is a 69 year old male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG 10/2097, who was referred on 6/03 from renal Dr. Turk, Elvis at the Central Buffalo Hospital to Dr. Judge at BHCC for rapidly progressive renal impairment.
21373	1	a	He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA.
21374	1	a	In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason.
21375	1	a	Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.
21376	1	a	His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98).
21377	1	a	He denies taking any NSAIDS.
21378	1	a	He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.
21379	1	a	Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides.
21380	1	a	Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty.
21381	1	a	He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.
21382	1	a	He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg.
21383	1	a	He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock.
21384	1	a	He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level.
21385	1	a	He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows.
21386	1	a	He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.

21451	1	a	ASSESSMENT:
21452	1	a	Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.
21453	1	a	PLAN:
21454	1	a	1.
21455	1	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
21456	1	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
21457	1	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
21458	1	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
21459	1	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
21460	1	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
21461	1	a	2.
21462	1	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
21463	1	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
21464	1	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
21465	1	a	3.
21466	1	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
21467	1	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
21468	1	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
21469	1	a	4.
21470	1	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
21471	1	a	5.
21472	1	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
21473	1	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

21478	1	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
21479	1	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
21480	1	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
21481	1	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
21482	1	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
21483	1	a	His options are:
21484	1	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
21485	1	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
21486	1	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
21487	1	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

21495	3	a	  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency.
21496	1	a	The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant.
21497	1	a	In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out.
21498	1	a	Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it.
21499	1	a	Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.

21502	3	a	Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
21503	1	a	The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.
21504	0	a	Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.
21505	1	a	The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.
21506	1	a	Chronic renal insufficiency
21507	1	a	The patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.
21508	1	a	Hypertension
21509	1	a	The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension.
21510	1	a	Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS.
21511	1	a	BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.
21512	1	a	Erectile dysfunction
21513	1	a	The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.
21514	1	a	For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.
21515	1	a	Anemia
21516	1	a	The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.
21517	1	a	He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.
21518	1	a	Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.
21519	1	a	Thrombocytosis

21524	1	a	This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.
21525	1	a	Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.
21526	1	a	We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.

21721	1	a	This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.
21722	1	a	His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.
21723	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.
21724	1	a	She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.
21725	1	a	This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.
21726	1	a	She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.
21727	1	a	She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.
21728	1	a	She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.
21729	1	a	She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.
21730	1	a	She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.
21731	1	a	At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.
21732	1	a	She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.
21733	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.
21734	1	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
21735	1	a	Her carotids are 2+.
21736	1	a	Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.
21737	1	a	There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
21738	1	a	Lungs are clear.
21739	1	a	Abdomen is benign.
21740	1	a	Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.
21741	1	a	Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.
21742	1	a	There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
21743	3	a	ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.
21744	3	a	After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.
21745	1	a	She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.
21746	1	a	She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

21950	1	a	DHN#: 7672624 
21951	1	a	DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
21952	1	a	CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
21953	1	a	Dear Vicente, 
21954	1	a	Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.
21955	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year.
21956	1	a	He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
21957	1	a	In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.
21958	1	a	He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
21959	1	a	"He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep."
21960	1	a	"He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties."
21961	1	a	He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
21962	1	a	Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas.
21963	1	a	In addition, loud snoring was noted.
21964	1	a	There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes.
21965	1	a	"There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep."
21966	1	a	"There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study."
21967	1	a	In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
21968	1	a	The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm.
21969	1	a	Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes).
21970	1	a	"There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep""."
21971	1	a	"Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows""."
21972	1	a	The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general.
21973	1	a	As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.
21974	1	a	Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology).
21975	1	a	"The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day""."
21976	1	a	If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.
21977	3	a	The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.

22011	1	a	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
22012	1	a	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
22013	1	a	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
22014	1	a	"No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted."
22015	1	a	IMPRESSION:  
22016	1	a	"Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep."
22017	1	a	These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).
22018	1	a	Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea.
22019	1	a	The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm).
22020	1	a	"In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success."
22021	1	a	"One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above."
22022	1	a	Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem.
22023	1	a	While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e.
22024	1	a	in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
22025	1	a	PLAN:  
22026	1	a	In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.
22027	1	a	q. h.s.
22028	1	a	PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
22029	1	a	The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.
22030	1	a	The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.
22031	1	a	Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms).
22032	1	a	If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.
22033	1	a	In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.
22034	1	a	The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).
22035	1	a	Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez.
22036	1	a	I hope this letter finds you well.

22090	1	a	Dear Fitzgerald:
22091	1	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
22092	1	a	As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
22093	1	a	At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.
22094	1	a	The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
22095	1	a	The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.
22096	1	a	There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
22097	1	a	He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
22098	1	a	At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
22099	1	a	That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.
22100	1	a	The right side was patent.
22101	1	a	With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.
22102	1	a	The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
22103	1	a	The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.
22104	1	a	Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
22105	1	a	There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
22106	1	a	The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
22107	1	a	He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.
22108	1	a	The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
22109	1	a	He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
22110	1	a	Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.
22111	1	a	This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
22112	1	a	The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
22113	1	a	He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.
22114	1	a	Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
22115	1	a	He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
22116	1	a	He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.
22117	1	a	The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
22118	1	a	His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
22119	1	a	He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
22120	1	a	He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.
22121	1	a	Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
22122	1	a	He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
22123	1	a	He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.
22124	1	a	Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
22125	1	a	"Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
22126	1	a	At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.
22127	1	a	Past medical history:
22128	1	a	   As above.
22129	1	a	Others include the following:

22178	1	a	Physical examination:
22179	1	a	-Pulse:   64 and regular
22180	1	a	-BP: 160/65    by my nurse, but I retook it at 130/60
22181	1	a	-General:   He is a well-appearing gentleman, looks younger than his age of 82 years
22182	1	a	-Heent:   Normal.
22183	1	a	EOMI.
22184	1	a	PERRL
22185	1	a	-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes normal.
22186	1	a	Bilateral bruits present, soft.
22187	1	a	No JVD
22188	1	a	-Chest:   Clear
22189	1	a	-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, soft S4, and a grade 1-2/6 murmur in the left lower sternal border
22190	1	a	-Abdomen:   Soft, positive bruit, no organomegaly, and no enlargements of the aorta
22191	1	a	-Extremities:   Femoral pulses 2+, bilateral bruits.
22192	1	a	Below this, feet are warm and well perfused, with 1+ edema bilaterally.
22193	1	a	Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides, not sure how well I am feeling them.
22194	1	a	Popliteal pulses are trace to 1+.
22195	1	a	No ulcers or gangrene.
22196	1	a	No tissue loss
22197	1	a	EKG:
22198	1	a	    - normal sinus rhythm at 64.
22199	1	a	Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.
22200	1	a	Other Data:
22201	1	a	   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
22202	1	a	Assessment and plan:
22203	1	a	   1.
22204	1	a	Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.
22205	1	a	This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
22206	1	a	I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.
22207	1	a	Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
22208	1	a	We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
22209	1	a	I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.
22210	1	a	Impression:
22211	1	a	Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.
22212	1	a	We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.
22213	1	a	Right leg has not been examined in the past.
22214	1	a	Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.
22215	1	a	Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
22216	1	a	Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
22217	1	a	Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
22218	1	a	If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.
22219	1	a	He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.
22220	1	a	Coronary artery disease - stable.
22221	3	a	Diabetes.
22222	1	a	Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

22461	1	a	chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
22462	1	a	disposition with the patient.
22463	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.
22464	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple
22465	1	a	medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.
22466	1	a	At her
22467	1	a	rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent
22468	1	a	here.
22469	1	a	The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable
22470	1	a	for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent
22471	1	a	hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the
22472	1	a	end of December through the beginning of January.
22473	1	a	The patient's
22474	1	a	chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the
22475	1	a	patient has been doing well at rehab since.
22476	1	a	However, today was
22477	1	a	noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.
22478	1	a	She had
22479	1	a	shortness of breath as well.
22480	1	a	Her oxygen saturations improved
22481	1	a	marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to
22482	1	a	nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.
22483	1	a	The patient was
22484	1	a	treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement
22485	1	a	and is noted to be quite tachypneic.
22486	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,
22487	3	a	diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,
22488	1	a	anemia, and cervical fracture.
22489	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited
22490	1	a	by the severity of the patient's presentation.
22491	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,
22492	1	a	Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,
22493	1	a	Colace, and Xalatan.
22494	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.
22495	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some
22496	1	a	degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and
22497	1	a	answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.
22498	1	a	Vital signs are as
22499	1	a	documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,
22500	1	a	and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.
22501	1	a	HEENT exam is
22502	1	a	atraumatic, normal to inspection.
22503	1	a	The patient has a large tongue
22504	1	a	and her uvula is not visible at all.
22505	1	a	Neck is immobilized in a
22506	1	a	C-collar and is obese.
22507	1	a	Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath
22508	1	a	sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory
22509	1	a	use.
22510	1	a	Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without
22511	1	a	murmur.
22512	1	a	Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.
22513	1	a	Abdomen is
22514	1	a	soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or
22515	1	a	masses, or guarding, or rebound.
22516	1	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry
22517	1	a	without any lesions or rash.
22518	1	a	Musculoskeletal exam reveals
22519	1	a	tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib
22520	1	a	fractures.
22521	1	a	Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty
22522	1	a	speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic
22523	1	a	deficit.
22524	1	a	LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.
22525	1	a	White
22526	1	a	blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is
22527	1	a	at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.
22528	1	a	LFTs within
22529	1	a	normal limit.
22530	1	a	INR 1.2.
22531	1	a	D-dimer significantly elevated.
22532	1	a	EKG
22533	1	a	demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
22534	1	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which
22535	1	a	are present previously but possibly slightly increased.
22536	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given
22537	1	a	Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was
22538	1	a	also started on CPAP.
22539	1	a	She seemed to be improving clinically for
22540	1	a	some period of time but then began to decline in her mental
22541	1	a	status.
22542	1	a	At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.
22543	1	a	Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient
22544	1	a	likely needed intubation.
22545	1	a	We had hope to hold off to do a
22546	1	a	thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines
22547	1	a	such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the
22548	1	a	procedure.
22549	1	a	On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable
22550	1	a	throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory
22551	1	a	distress.
22552	1	a	Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex
22553	1	a	her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful
22554	1	a	in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in
22555	1	a	between those attempts.
22556	1	a	For full details of the procedure,
22557	1	a	please see the attached procedure note.
22558	1	a	Thoracic Surgery was
22559	1	a	consulted.
22560	1	a	They arrived as the patient was being intubated.
22561	1	a	At
22562	1	a	this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to
22563	1	a	determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural
22564	1	a	effusion and whether it is loculated.
22565	1	a	This study will be
22566	1	a	performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in
22567	1	a	the ICU.
22568	1	a	A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and
22569	1	a	the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.
22570	1	a	******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
22571	1	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
22572	1	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.
22573	1	a	TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural
22574	1	a	effusion.
22575	1	a	FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.
22576	1	a	DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.
22577	1	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

22647	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
22648	1	a	Edema.
22649	1	a	The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.
22650	1	a	She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.
22651	1	a	I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.
22652	1	a	She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.
22653	1	a	Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.
22654	1	a	I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.
22655	1	a	Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.
22656	1	a	The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.
22657	1	a	I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
22658	1	a	I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.
22659	1	a	I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.
22660	1	a	Low back pain.
22661	1	a	I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.
22662	1	a	We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.
22663	1	a	We elected against using these medications today.
22664	1	a	History of sleep apnea.
22665	1	a	The patient has significant fatigue.
22666	1	a	This may be due to her sleep apnea.
22667	1	a	In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.
22668	1	a	I discussed this with her today.
22669	1	a	I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.
22670	1	a	She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.
22671	1	a	She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

23135	1	a	IDENTIFICATION:  This 65-year-old man with a 5-year history of cardiomyopathy is is admitted with worsening heart failure and recent presyncope for further evaluation.
23136	1	a	He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.
23137	1	a	He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.
23138	1	a	He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.
23139	1	a	He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.
23140	1	a	He has had some episodic nature to this.
23141	1	a	Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.
23142	1	a	This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.
23143	1	a	He had no palpitations at that time.
23144	1	a	He has no chest discomfort.
23145	1	a	His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.
23146	3	a	He has diabetes.
23147	1	a	He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.
23148	1	a	His current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.
23149	1	a	He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.
23150	1	a	He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.
23151	1	a	He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.
23152	1	a	He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.
23153	1	a	He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.
23154	1	a	He is on insulin and Lantus.
23155	1	a	He has no known drug allergies.
23156	1	a	His family history is essentially unremarkable.
23157	1	a	Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.
23158	1	a	The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.
23159	1	a	He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.
23160	1	a	He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.
23161	1	a	Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.
23162	1	a	He has no problems with swallowing.
23163	1	a	He has no problems with hearing or vision.
23164	1	a	Review of systems is otherwise negative.
23165	1	a	On physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.
23166	1	a	His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.
23167	1	a	Temperature is 35.9.
23168	1	a	His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.
23169	1	a	His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.
23170	1	a	He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.
23171	1	a	The right ventricular impulse is present also.
23172	1	a	He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.
23173	1	a	It does not change with respiration.
23174	1	a	The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.
23175	1	a	His legs are cool.
23176	1	a	Venous pattern is very prominent.
23177	1	a	His pulses are intact peripherally.
23178	1	a	He has no abdominal bruits.
23179	1	a	His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.
23180	1	a	He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.
23181	1	a	His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.
23182	1	a	He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.
23183	1	a	Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.
23184	1	a	There is no peripheral edema.
23185	1	a	His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.
23186	1	a	He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.
23187	1	a	His standing blood pressure is unchanged.
23188	1	a	He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.
23189	1	a	ASSESSMENT:
23190	1	a	1.
23191	1	a	Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.
23192	1	a	We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.
23193	1	a	The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.
23194	1	a	He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.
23195	1	a	However, the episodicity is significant.
23196	1	a	2.
23197	1	a	Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.
23198	1	a	His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.
23199	1	a	However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.
23200	1	a	It is also possible that this is related to angina.
23201	1	a	3.
23202	1	a	Other related risks.
23203	1	a	He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.
23204	1	a	It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.
23205	1	a	There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.
23206	1	a	At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.
23207	1	a	Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.
23208	1	a	We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

23700	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.
23701	1	a	1.
23702	1	a	Pain.
23703	1	a	He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.
23704	1	a	Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.
23705	1	a	He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin.
23706	1	a	It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.
23707	1	a	Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions.
23708	1	a	He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.

23711	1	a	He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan.
23712	1	a	The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.
23713	1	a	He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.

23903	1	a	RE: Michael Ogrady
23904	1	a	       MR #631-90-33-7
23905	1	a	Dear Dr. Patton:
23906	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
23907	1	a	his coronary artery
23908	1	a	disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.
23909	1	a	As you know, this is a 
23910	1	a	63-year-old male with a
23911	3	a	long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 
23912	1	a	peripheral vascular
23913	1	a	disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 
23914	1	a	diagnosed
23915	1	a	esophageal carcinoma.
23916	1	a	He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 
23917	1	a	Landers, for the last nine
23918	1	a	years.
23919	1	a	Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
23920	1	a	artery disease which is
23921	1	a	documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
23922	1	a	The 
23923	1	a	catheterization demonstrated
23924	1	a	right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 
23925	1	a	and a 30%
23926	1	a	marginal 1 lesion.
23927	1	a	There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
23928	1	a	PDA and from the
23929	1	a	septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.
23930	1	a	procedure was
23931	1	a	performed through the right radial artery without complications.
23932	1	a	Patient 
23933	1	a	also has peripheral
23934	1	a	vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
23935	1	a	vein bypass graft in
23936	1	a	2088.
23937	1	a	He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
23938	1	a	femoral to posterior
23939	1	a	tibial graft.
23940	1	a	He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.
23941	1	a	His activity level is 
23942	1	a	limited by his claudication.
23943	3	a	He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 
23944	1	a	treatment.
23945	1	a	At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.
23946	1	a	He gets 
23947	1	a	chest pressure one to
23948	1	a	two times a month.
23949	1	a	However, his activity is extremely limited.
23950	1	a	He reports 
23951	1	a	that he has had a
23952	1	a	positive stress test.
23953	1	a	Further information is not available.
23954	1	a	understands he has coronary
23955	1	a	disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.
23956	1	a	On 
23957	1	a	catheterization he had
23958	1	a	preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
23959	1	a	He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
23960	1	a	after receiving
23961	1	a	chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
23962	1	a	Patient states he will be 
23963	1	a	receiving a Hickman

23967	1	a	catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 
23968	1	a	therapy.
23969	1	a	On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.
23970	1	a	His blood 
23971	1	a	pressure is 100/72,
23972	1	a	heart rate is 57 bpm.
23973	1	a	HEENT: oropharynx benign.
23974	1	a	Neck: carotids intact 
23975	1	a	bilaterally without
23976	1	a	audible bruits.
23977	1	a	Lungs: distant breath sounds.
23978	1	a	Cor: without obvious jugular 
23979	1	a	venous distention.
23980	1	a	Heart sounds distant.
23981	1	a	Normal S1 and S2.
23982	1	a	No appreciable murmurs.
23983	1	a	Abdomen: 
23984	1	a	unable to palpate
23985	1	a	firm masses or aortic aneurysm.
23986	1	a	Bowel sounds present.
23987	1	a	Extremities: status 
23988	1	a	post surgery to the
23989	1	a	left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.
23990	1	a	Distal pulses are absent.
23991	1	a	Neuro: 
23992	1	a	intact.
23993	1	a	EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.
23994	1	a	IMI with age undetermined.
23995	1	a	Nonspecific STT
23996	1	a	wave abnormalities present.
23997	1	a	No previous EKG for comparison.
23998	1	a	Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 
23999	1	a	artery disease and
24000	1	a	peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
24001	1	a	He 
24002	1	a	clearly has ischemia
24003	1	a	on a positive stress test.
24004	1	a	I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
24005	1	a	check ischemic
24006	1	a	threshold.
24007	1	a	He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
24008	1	a	event.
24009	1	a	However, given
24010	1	a	his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 
24011	1	a	surgery even
24012	1	a	understanding possible complications.
24013	1	a	Plan:
24014	1	a	1.
24015	1	a	Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
24016	1	a	2.
24017	1	a	Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
24018	1	a	control of
24019	1	a	     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 
24020	1	a	dobutamine
24021	1	a	     echocardiography.
24022	1	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 
24023	1	a	Ogrady.
24024	1	a	Please do
24025	1	a	not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

24146	1	a	Dear Dr. Yancy: 
24147	1	a	  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
24148	1	a	Her history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia.
24149	1	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective.
24150	1	a	She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years.
24151	1	a	She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago.
24152	1	a	"She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved."
24153	1	a	Her catheterization revealed non-significant CAD.
24154	1	a	Significant spasm in the ostium of the RCA.
24155	1	a	The distal RCA at the prior intervention site looks normal.
24156	1	a	She denies any further neurological events or headaches.
24157	1	a	Of note, she reveals that a few weeks prior to onset of chest pain she began smoking again.
24158	1	a	She was smoking 5 cigs/day, and has stopped since Saturday when she resumed her Chantix treatment plan.
24159	1	a	Our last recorded lipid profile drawn on 5/2/2064: CHOL: 135, HDL: 50.

24222	1	a	Assessment and plan:
24223	1	a	   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
24224	1	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
24225	1	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
24226	1	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
24227	1	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
24228	1	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
24229	1	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

24418	1	a	ED Attending Physician Note
24419	1	a	See NP note for full details.
24420	1	a	Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week.
24421	1	a	The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain.
24422	1	a	He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder.
24423	1	a	No fevers/chills.
24424	1	a	Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

24430	1	a	Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift.
24431	1	a	Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.
24432	1	a	Medical Decision Making ED Course
24433	1	a	75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED.
24434	1	a	The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance.
24435	1	a	Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well.
24436	1	a	Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications).
24437	1	a	Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.
24438	1	a	Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

24753	1	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
24754	1	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
24755	1	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
24756	3	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
24757	1	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
24758	1	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
24759	1	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
24760	1	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
24761	1	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
24762	1	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
24763	1	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
24764	1	a	She denies any recent seizures.
24765	1	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

24813	1	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
24814	3	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
24815	1	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
24816	1	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
24817	1	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
24818	1	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
24819	1	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
24820	1	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
24821	1	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
24822	1	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
24823	1	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
24824	1	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
24825	1	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
24826	1	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
24827	1	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
24828	1	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
24829	1	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
24830	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
24831	1	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

24883	1	a	Re: Nancy Xayarath
24884	1	a	ANC Unit #:  111-64-17
24885	1	a	Dear Dr. Townsend:
24886	1	a	"	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot."
24887	3	a	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.
24888	1	a	She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.
24889	1	a	She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot.
24890	1	a	She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.
24891	1	a	Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her.
24892	1	a	She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in.
24893	1	a	Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.
24894	3	a	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
24895	1	a	Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.
24896	1	a	She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.
24897	1	a	Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.
24898	1	a	She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.
24899	1	a	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.
24900	1	a	She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.
24901	1	a	She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely.
24902	1	a	She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
24903	1	a	The skin is of normal turgor.
24904	1	a	She has no active plantar ulcers on 
24905	1	a	Page two
24906	1	a	Re:  Nancy Xayarath
24907	1	a	Date: February 17, 2100
24908	1	a	either foot.
24909	1	a	At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.
24910	1	a	No new x-rays were obtained today.
24911	1	a	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.
24912	1	a	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.
24913	1	a	It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.
24914	1	a	I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.
24915	1	a	I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.
24916	1	a	We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer.
24917	1	a	She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime.
24918	1	a	Thank you kindly for this referral.

25023	1	a	5/20/94 at 11:30 am
25024	1	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
25025	1	a	History of Present Illness
25026	1	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
25027	1	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
25028	1	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
25029	1	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
25030	1	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
25031	1	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
25032	1	a	There was no PCI option available.
25033	1	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
25034	1	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
25035	1	a	He now presented for cath.
25036	1	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
25037	1	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
25038	1	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
25039	1	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
25040	1	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
25041	1	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
25042	1	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
25043	1	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.

25248	1	a	We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.
25249	1	a	It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.
25250	1	a	I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.
25251	1	a	- F/u with Dr. Vest
25252	1	a	       - Follow INR
25253	1	a	       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife
25254	1	a	Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.
25255	1	a	He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump.
25256	1	a	His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).
25257	1	a	GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.
25258	1	a	It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.
25259	1	a	We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.
25260	1	a	His synthetic function is mostly preserved.
25261	3	a	DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.

25380	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
25381	1	a	hives after taking Keflex.
25382	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
25383	1	a	chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
25384	1	a	axilla and her groin.
25385	1	a	She has been to the emergency room
25386	1	a	multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.
25387	1	a	She has
25388	1	a	been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
25389	1	a	dicloxacillin.
25390	1	a	She is planning to have her disease surgically
25391	1	a	managed in the next few months.
25392	1	a	She most recently presented to
25393	1	a	the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
25394	1	a	of her hydradenitis in her groin.
25395	1	a	She was given a prescription
25396	1	a	of Keflex.
25397	1	a	Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
25398	1	a	itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.
25399	1	a	She
25400	1	a	denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
25401	1	a	consciousness.
25402	1	a	She called the emergency room and was instructed
25403	1	a	to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
25404	1	a	reaction.
25405	1	a	So now, she is here for follow up from that.
25406	1	a	She said
25407	1	a	shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
25408	1	a	itchiness have improved very quickly.
25409	1	a	She is still complaining
25410	1	a	of purulent drainage around her groin.
25411	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.
25412	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.
25413	1	a	ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.
25414	1	a	gets hives from both.
25415	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.
25416	1	a	Her bilateral
25417	1	a	groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
25418	1	a	purulent drainage.
25419	1	a	There is no fluctuance that I could feel.
25420	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.
25421	1	a	Given the
25422	1	a	recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
25423	1	a	different antibiotic.
25424	1	a	She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
25425	1	a	with good result.
25426	1	a	Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
25427	1	a	compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
25428	1	a	now.
25429	1	a	If this does not work, I think one should consider
25430	1	a	clindamycin for treatment.
25431	1	a	I will go ahead and give her 14 days
25432	1	a	worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D.
25433	1	a	if
25434	1	a	she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.
25435	1	a	I also gave
25436	1	a	her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
25437	1	a	prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.
25438	1	a	She should see her
25439	1	a	PCP in two weeks.

25497	3	a	History of Present Illness: The patient presents today for follow up of his diabetes and heart disease, and to follow up as well as recent proximal humeral fracture that will not require surgery per his orthopedic specialist.
25498	1	a	The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder, sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned.
25499	1	a	The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital, he was told to have no work for the next 3 months.
25500	1	a	He also received reports no chest pain, PND or orthopnea, he also denies any AICD firing, and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions.
25501	3	a	He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, he currently uses NPH insulin 42 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time.
25502	1	a	He reports no polyuria or polydipsia.
25503	1	a	His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago.
25504	1	a	He is currently on no replacement for testosterone, and only recently started calcium and vitamin D after his fracture.
25505	1	a	He has not had an eye examination in over a year.

25526	1	a	                                             FPM#:  236-67-03-3
25527	1	a	Dear Dr. Stafford:
25528	1	a	     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
25529	1	a	Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
25530	1	a	as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
25531	1	a	In summary, she is
25532	3	a	a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
25533	1	a	since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.
25534	1	a	By
25535	3	a	report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
25536	1	a	peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.
25537	1	a	In viewing
25538	1	a	her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.
25539	1	a	Her
25540	1	a	three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
25541	1	a	She does,
25542	1	a	however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
25543	1	a	on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
25544	1	a	These episodes are
25545	1	a	relieved by nitroglycerin.
25546	1	a	Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
25547	1	a	walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
25548	1	a	by slowing down.
25549	3	a	In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
25550	1	a	only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.
25551	1	a	cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.
25552	1	a	I don't have
25553	1	a	fractionations and her family history is unknown.
25554	1	a	A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
25555	1	a	ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
25556	1	a	preserved LV size and function.
25557	1	a	She had an exercise tolerance test
25558	1	a	in February of 2085.
25559	1	a	On a modified protocol, she went for less
25560	1	a	than 4 1/2 minutes.
25561	1	a	This is equivalent to not even completing
25562	1	a	stage 1 of the standard Bruce.
25563	1	a	With that, she did develop chest
25564	1	a	pain and had 2 mm of ST depression.
25565	1	a	That study was accompanied by
25566	1	a	both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
25567	1	a	consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
25568	1	a	ischemia.
25569	1	a	As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
25570	1	a	portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
25571	1	a	to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
25572	1	a	That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
25573	1	a	only have the report.
25574	1	a	However, from this report, there was
25575	1	a	preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
25576	1	a	MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
25577	1	a	Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
25578	1	a	proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
25579	1	a	LAD.
25580	1	a	The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
25581	1	a	discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
25582	1	a	The
25583	1	a	right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
25584	1	a	stenosis.
25585	1	a	At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
25586	1	a	therapy.
25587	1	a	Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
25588	1	a	prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
25589	1	a	other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
25590	1	a	daily insulin therapy.
25591	1	a	In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
25592	1	a	have involved the hemodialysis access.
25593	1	a	She has had one pregnancy
25594	1	a	28 years ago without complications.
25595	1	a	I also elicited a history of
25596	1	a	some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
25597	1	a	This
25598	1	a	was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
25599	1	a	On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
25600	1	a	regular, her weight 95 lbs.
25601	1	a	Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
25602	1	a	arm.
25603	1	a	There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
25604	1	a	distended.
25605	1	a	Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained.
25606	1	a	There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
25607	1	a	apex.
25608	1	a	Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
25609	1	a	were without edema.
25610	1	a	The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
25611	1	a	diffuse STT changes.
25612	1	a	There were no pathologic Q waves.
25613	1	a	Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
25614	1	a	transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
25615	1	a	status.
25616	3	a	She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
25617	1	a	shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
25618	1	a	limited functional capacity.
25619	1	a	The coronary angiography reveals a
25620	1	a	presence of multi-vessel disease.
25621	1	a	Even without seeing the primary
25622	1	a	data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
25623	3	a	she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.
25624	1	a	Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
25625	1	a	bypass surgery.
25626	1	a	Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
25627	1	a	with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.
25628	1	a	I
25629	1	a	would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
25630	1	a	10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.
25631	1	a	As
25632	1	a	indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
25633	1	a	suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
25634	1	a	symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
25635	1	a	pressing.
25636	1	a	I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
25637	1	a	her care.
25638	1	a	Sincerely,

26099	1	a	1.
26100	1	a	Hypertension.
26101	1	a	2.
26102	1	a	Pedal edema.
26103	1	a	3.
26104	3	a	Diabetes.
26105	1	a	HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
26106	1	a	up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
26107	1	a	past 2 weeks.
26108	1	a	When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very
26109	1	a	dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
26110	1	a	to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
26111	1	a	creatinine and BUN.
26112	1	a	She responded well to this and then did
26113	1	a	well for a week or so.
26114	1	a	Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
26115	1	a	increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening.
26116	1	a	Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is
26117	1	a	up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.
26118	1	a	Of
26119	1	a	note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it
26120	1	a	was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.
26121	1	a	She reports her
26122	1	a	blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from
26123	1	a	90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.
26124	1	a	She
26125	1	a	has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
26126	1	a	months.
26127	1	a	She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
26128	3	a	Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.
26129	1	a	reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
26130	1	a	normal as well.
26131	1	a	She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased
26132	1	a	shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.
26133	1	a	No fever or
26134	1	a	chills.
26135	1	a	Remainder review of systems negative.
26136	1	a	She does
26137	1	a	report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
26138	1	a	has had but has noted it over the past few months.
26139	1	a	MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.
26140	1	a	ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.
26141	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
26142	1	a	distress.
26143	1	a	Her skin is very tanned.
26144	1	a	Blood pressure 148/62,
26145	1	a	on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight
26146	1	a	is up about 6 pounds for her.
26147	1	a	HEENT within normal limits.
26148	1	a	Neck: no JVD.
26149	1	a	Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
26150	1	a	crackles or rhonchi.
26151	1	a	Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,
26152	1	a	II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.
26153	1	a	Abdomen is
26154	1	a	benign.
26155	1	a	Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
26156	1	a	mid shin.
26157	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
26158	1	a	New pedal edema.
26159	1	a	Reviewing patient's recent lab results,
26160	1	a	she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
26161	1	a	the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
26162	1	a	improved.
26163	1	a	I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
26164	1	a	Norvasc.
26165	1	a	Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and
26166	1	a	she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
26167	1	a	it may take a few days to resolve.
26168	1	a	Will consider increasing
26169	1	a	her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
26170	1	a	Norvasc and her labs.
26171	1	a	Will check basic metabolic panel and
26172	1	a	urinalysis as well.
26173	1	a	Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.
26174	1	a	Will start
26175	1	a	atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
26176	1	a	the next few days.
26177	1	a	Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
26178	1	a	to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
26179	1	a	for a repeat blood pressure check.
26180	1	a	The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
26181	3	a	appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
26182	1	a	see if there is anything more we can do to change her
26183	1	a	insulin regimen.
26184	1	a	The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
26185	1	a	otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
26186	1	a	sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

26565	1	a	Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.
26566	1	a	2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.
26567	1	a	Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.
26568	1	a	Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.
26569	1	a	3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.
26570	1	a	There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.
26571	1	a	The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.
26572	1	a	4.
26573	1	a	There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.
26574	1	a	They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.
26575	1	a	The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis.
26576	1	a	The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.
26577	1	a	There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.
26578	1	a	5.
26579	1	a	Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.
26580	1	a	Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT.
26581	1	a	Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.
26582	1	a	Assessment:
26583	1	a	" 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back."""
26584	1	a	Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.
26585	1	a	No other major symptoms.
26586	1	a	Plan:
26587	1	a	#
26588	1	a	 SOB
26589	1	a	Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.
26590	1	a	Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday.
26591	1	a	Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection.
26592	1	a	Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).
26593	1	a	-Large acute PE ruled out with CT
26594	1	a	-?
26595	1	a	of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea
26596	1	a	-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
26597	1	a	-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.
26598	1	a	BNP is not very high.
26599	1	a	However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.
26600	1	a	Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
26601	1	a	-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.
26602	1	a	Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.
26603	1	a	-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) 
26604	1	a	 NSCLC
26605	1	a	Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.
26606	1	a	Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.
26607	1	a	-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey
26608	1	a	-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u
26609	1	a	#Anxiety/Depression
26610	1	a	Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.
26611	1	a	Additionally takes seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine.
26612	1	a	Patient is very anxious on exam with intermittent crying, fearful expression.
26613	1	a	-Continue on home regimen Seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine
26614	1	a	-Clonazepam  0.25 QAM, 0.5 mg QHS, 0.25 daily PRN while in house
26615	1	a	#Cardiac: Continue with home meds, will diurese as above for possible CHF exacerbation
26616	1	a	 -Continue ASA, metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin  
26617	1	a	#DM
26618	1	a	Home regimen is 70/30 50 units BID and Levemir 40-50 units QHS, titrated to sugars.
26619	1	a	Lowered totalo dose of insulin to 100 (70% of home dose), distibuted between basal and mealtime insulin, with additional sliding scale
26620	1	a	-Continue to up-titrate insulin 
26621	1	a	#Chronic Back Pain
26622	1	a	-Continue percocet and lidocaine patches PRN.
26623	1	a	Other Chronic issues (GERD, endometriasl hyperplasia, skin care)

26703	1	a	Record date: 2070-03-24
26704	1	a	Neurology Clinic Follow-up
26705	1	a	ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections
26706	1	a	HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.
26707	1	a	Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.
26708	1	a	The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.
26709	1	a	Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.
26710	1	a	Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.
26711	1	a	He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.
26712	1	a	Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.
26713	1	a	His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.
26714	1	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
26715	1	a	Homocysteine was normal.
26716	1	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
26717	1	a	The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.
26718	1	a	The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.
26719	1	a	He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
26720	1	a	His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.
26721	1	a	Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.
26722	1	a	The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.
26723	1	a	This may represent abscess.
26724	1	a	Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.
26725	1	a	Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.
26726	1	a	Patient denies fever or chills.
26727	1	a	He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.
26728	1	a	This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.
26729	1	a	Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.
26730	1	a	He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.
26731	1	a	His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.
26732	1	a	He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.
26733	1	a	His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.
26734	1	a	While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.
26735	1	a	He cries when he tells me about this.
26736	1	a	A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.
26737	1	a	He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.
26738	1	a	His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.
26739	1	a	There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.
26740	1	a	He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.
26741	1	a	An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.
26742	1	a	He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.
26743	1	a	Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.
26744	1	a	They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses.

26792	1	a	For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.
26793	1	a	Patient will stop trazodone.
26794	1	a	If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.
26795	1	a	Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.
26796	1	a	At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.
26797	1	a	5.
26798	1	a	Follow-up in 3 months.

27196	1	a	The patient was seen and examined by me.
27197	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 
27198	3	a	history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 
27199	1	a	unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 
27200	1	a	history of any surgical procedures.
27201	1	a	He presents with a burn on the 
27202	1	a	right side of the neck.
27203	1	a	He presents to the emergency department 
27204	1	a	with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 
27205	1	a	minor soft tissue swelling.
27206	1	a	The trachea is midline.
27207	1	a	The uvula is 
27208	1	a	midline.
27209	1	a	There is no airway compromise.

27212	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.
27213	1	a	The airway is patent and

27215	1	a	The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.
27216	1	a	The examination

27222	1	a	and discharged home.
27223	1	a	He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 
27224	1	a	recheck.
27225	1	a	The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 
27226	1	a	need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only

27254	1	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
27255	3	a	Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.
27256	1	a	His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.
27257	1	a	He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.
27258	1	a	It does not radiate.
27259	1	a	It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.
27260	1	a	It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.
27261	1	a	He has not had any recent URI symptoms.
27262	1	a	Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.
27263	1	a	He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.
27264	1	a	He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.
27265	1	a	He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.
27266	1	a	He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.
27267	1	a	His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.
27268	1	a	He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.
27269	1	a	He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).
27270	1	a	On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.
27271	1	a	He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.

27506	3	a	   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD.
27507	1	a	He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35.
27508	1	a	A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis.
27509	1	a	His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR.
27510	1	a	He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG.
27511	1	a	9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain.
27512	1	a	n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities.
27513	1	a	There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories.
27514	1	a	EF 55%.
27515	1	a	There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex.
27516	1	a	The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible.
27517	1	a	9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL.
27518	1	a	mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1.
27519	1	a	The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion.
27520	1	a	The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting.
27521	1	a	The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third.
27522	1	a	He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result.
27523	1	a	This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD.
27524	1	a	The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis.
27525	1	a	Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent.
27526	1	a	The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis.
27527	1	a	At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection.
27528	1	a	The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort.
27529	1	a	He was discharged home on 9/06/35.
27530	1	a	Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat.
27531	1	a	He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea.
27532	1	a	He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.
27533	1	a	His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.
27534	1	a	He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea.

27666	1	a	Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant.
27667	1	a	Rule out 
27668	1	a	osteoporosis.
27669	1	a	HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
27670	1	a	diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.
27671	1	a	At 
27672	1	a	the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
27673	1	a	Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
27674	1	a	but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
27675	1	a	approximately 26 weeks.
27676	1	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
27677	1	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
27678	3	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
27679	1	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
27680	1	a	Subsequently he 
27681	1	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
27682	1	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
27683	1	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.
27684	1	a	He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
27685	1	a	100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
27686	1	a	Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.
27687	1	a	The patient's 
27688	3	a	complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.
27689	1	a	There is 
27690	1	a	no peripheral neuropathy.
27691	1	a	There is no autonomic neuropathy.
27692	1	a	No retinal 
27693	1	a	disease.
27694	1	a	However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
27695	1	a	creatinine currently of 2.4.
27696	1	a	Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
27697	1	a	symptoms in the early 80s.
27698	1	a	By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
27699	1	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July

27796	1	a	His CBC 
27797	1	a	revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
27798	1	a	normal differential.
27799	1	a	Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
27800	1	a	multiple medical problems.
27801	1	a	The one's most pertinent to us currently are 
27802	1	a	007 Lunar Lane                           61248040
27803	1	a	Page 3
27804	1	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
27805	1	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
27806	1	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
27807	1	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
27808	1	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
27809	1	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
27810	1	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
27811	1	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
27812	1	a	patients.
27813	1	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
27814	1	a	this makes sense.
27815	1	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
27816	1	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
27817	1	a	reasons.
27818	1	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
27819	1	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
27820	1	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
27821	1	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
27822	1	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
27823	1	a	We would be a little 
27824	1	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
27825	1	a	without more information about this patient.
27826	3	a	The patient's diabetes 
27827	1	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
27828	1	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
27829	1	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
27830	1	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
27831	1	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
27832	1	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
27833	1	a	situation.
27834	1	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to 
27835	1	a	315 Lunar Lane                           61248040

27838	1	a	be seen.

28059	1	a	                                              10-19-86
28060	1	a	This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
28061	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
28062	1	a	obesity.
28063	1	a	Her problems are as follows:
28064	1	a	1.
28065	1	a	Diabetes.
28066	1	a	She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
28067	1	a	     and she was put on insulin by me.
28068	1	a	Xitlali Xia followed her in 
28069	1	a	     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
28070	1	a	     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.
28071	1	a	She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
28072	1	a	     list of her blood sugars.
28073	1	a	She says she does take them about twice a 
28074	1	a	     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
28075	1	a	     threw them away.
28076	1	a	She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
28077	1	a	     they usually are about 110.
28078	1	a	It was 101 this morning before 
28079	1	a	     breakfast, she says.
28080	1	a	She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
28081	1	a	     six times it has been below 50.
28082	1	a	She does say she eats three regular 
28083	1	a	     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
28084	1	a	     breakfast she said no.
28085	1	a	She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
28086	1	a	I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.
28087	1	a	I expressed to her again how 
28088	1	a	     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.
28089	1	a	She had been eating a lot of chocolate.
28090	1	a	She says she has gotten off 
28091	1	a	     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
28092	1	a	     then.
28093	1	a	She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
28094	1	a	     help her with her diet.
28095	1	a	If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
28096	1	a	     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.
28097	1	a	I explained to her, too, 
28098	1	a	     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
28099	1	a	     be able to get her off the insulin.
28100	1	a	This seemed to be something that 
28101	1	a	     she would like to do.
28102	1	a	Hopefully the nutritionist can help.
28103	1	a	I also 
28104	1	a	     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
28105	1	a	     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
28106	1	a	     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
28107	1	a	     really going on and whether they are getting too low.
28108	1	a	She denies any 
28109	1	a	     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.
28110	1	a	I am 
28111	1	a	     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.
28112	1	a	She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
28113	1	a	     nothing.
28114	1	a	She felt totally normal.
28115	1	a	So hopefully she will really 
28116	1	a	     record these and we will get a better idea.
28117	1	a	She said this always 
28118	1	a	     happens in the morning.
28119	1	a	She kept contradicting herself and had no 
28120	1	a	     documentation.
28121	1	a	I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
28122	1	a	Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.
28123	1	a	She does drink juice, 
28124	1	a	     but I went over the symptoms again with her.
28125	1	a	She will call me if she 
28126	1	a	     does have any.
28127	1	a	10-19-86
28128	1	a	2.
28129	1	a	Left ankle pain.
28130	1	a	I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.
28131	1	a	She said that she may do some surgery on her.
28132	1	a	3.
28133	1	a	Dysuria.
28134	1	a	She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
28135	1	a	     Bactrim.
28136	1	a	4.
28137	1	a	Yeast infection.
28138	1	a	She said this has also resolved.
28139	1	a	5.
28140	1	a	She complains of headache.
28141	1	a	She says these have been going on for two 
28142	1	a	     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.
28143	1	a	She has had nausea and vomited once.
28144	1	a	This happened pretty much every 
28145	1	a	     day and it can be at any time of the day.
28146	1	a	Tylenol and Advil did not 
28147	1	a	     help.
28148	1	a	She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
28149	1	a	     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.
28150	1	a	But she has no further prodrome.
28151	1	a	She says it is a banging kind of 
28152	1	a	     pain that is rhythmic.
28153	1	a	She also says she does see stars in front of 
28154	1	a	     her eyes when it happens.
28155	1	a	I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
28156	1	a	     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
28157	1	a	     sometimes.
28158	1	a	It has been happening for a couple of weeks.
28159	1	a	I discussed 
28160	1	a	     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
28161	1	a	     migraines.
28162	1	a	I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
28163	1	a	     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.
28164	1	a	Her neuro exam 
28165	1	a	     was totally normal.
28166	1	a	Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.
28167	1	a	Her gait was normal.
28168	1	a	Light touch was touched.
28169	1	a	Her toes were 
28170	1	a	     downgoing.
28171	1	a	Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.
28172	1	a	Her disks were 
28173	1	a	     sharp.
28174	1	a	EOMI, PERRL.
28175	1	a	I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
28176	1	a	     t.i.d.
28177	1	a	and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
28178	1	a	     her left ear.
28179	1	a	I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
28180	1	a	6.
28181	1	a	Health maintenance.
28182	1	a	I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
28183	1	a	     that she might benefit from a flu shot.
28184	1	a	She has no interest in this 
28185	1	a	     at all.
28186	1	a	Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
28187	1	a	     cuff.
28188	1	a	Her pulse was 96.
28189	1	a	Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
28190	1	a	     285.

28850	1	a	The patient was seen and examined by me, and

28852	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a
28853	1	a	46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,
28854	3	a	diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.
28855	1	a	She is also dialysis
28856	1	a	dependent.
28857	1	a	Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute
28858	1	a	onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and
28859	1	a	diaphoresis while at home.
28860	1	a	Called EMS and was brought to the
28861	1	a	Emergency Department.
28862	1	a	The patient is unable to give a full
28863	1	a	history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory
28864	1	a	distress.
28865	1	a	Please review resident's note for full details of
28866	1	a	obtainable past medical history, social history, review of
28867	1	a	systems, medications, and allergies.
28868	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as
28869	1	a	documented.
28870	1	a	The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.
28871	1	a	Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted
28872	1	a	at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.
28873	1	a	Physical exam
28874	1	a	reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with
28875	1	a	accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.
28876	1	a	She has rales
28877	1	a	halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
28878	1	a	Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.
28879	1	a	Abdomen is obese but soft.
28880	1	a	Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees.
28881	1	a	Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.
28882	1	a	On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual
28883	1	a	nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.
28884	1	a	She is known to make urine, a
28885	1	a	Foley catheter was placed immediately.
28886	1	a	IV access was
28887	1	a	established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics.
28888	1	a	Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.
28889	1	a	On
28890	1	a	BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.
28891	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit
28892	1	a	of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.
28893	1	a	BNP was noted at
28894	1	a	700.
28895	1	a	Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was
28896	1	a	less than assay.
28897	1	a	However, labs were obtained within half an hour
28898	1	a	of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.
28899	1	a	Urinalysis
28900	1	a	was negative and urine HCG was negative.
28901	1	a	EKG was sinus
28902	1	a	tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for
28903	1	a	rate-related ischemia.
28904	1	a	There were no prior EKGs available.
28905	1	a	Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.
28906	1	a	The Nephrology fellow covering
28907	1	a	hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate
28908	1	a	hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.
28909	1	a	DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and
28910	1	a	CHF.
28911	1	a	ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is
28912	1	a	likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary
28913	1	a	edema and subsequent symptomatology.
28914	1	a	Given the current regimen,
28915	1	a	in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.
28916	1	a	The
28917	1	a	respiratory rate was noted at 23.
28918	1	a	Her heart rate came down to
28919	1	a	113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV
28920	1	a	nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.
28921	1	a	The patient was taken to
28922	1	a	hemodialysis at 7:45 and admitted to the hospital thereafter for

28987	1	a	To Whom It May Concern:
28988	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
28989	3	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
28990	1	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
28991	1	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
28992	1	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
28993	1	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
28994	1	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
28995	1	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
28996	1	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
28997	1	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
28998	3	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
28999	1	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
29000	1	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
29001	3	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.
29002	1	a	Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
29003	1	a	daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
29004	1	a	daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
29005	1	a	daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o.
29006	1	a	daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
29007	1	a	daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o.
29008	1	a	daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
29009	1	a	daily.
29010	1	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
29011	1	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
29012	1	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
29013	1	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
29014	1	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
29015	1	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
29016	1	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
29017	1	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
29018	1	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
29019	1	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
29020	1	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
29021	1	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
29022	1	a	He has good distal pulsations.
29023	1	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
29024	1	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
29025	1	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
29026	1	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
29027	1	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
29028	1	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
29029	3	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
29030	1	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
29031	1	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
29032	1	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
29033	3	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
29034	1	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
29035	1	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
29036	1	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
29037	1	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
29038	1	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
29039	1	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
29040	1	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
29041	1	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
29042	3	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
29043	0	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
29044	1	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
29045	1	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
29046	1	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
29047	1	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
29048	1	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
29049	1	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
29050	1	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
29051	1	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
29052	1	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
29053	1	a	Thank you.
29054	1	a	Sincerely,

29393	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old female who presents today for hospital followup.
29394	1	a	I admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.
29395	1	a	She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.
29396	1	a	Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.
29397	1	a	She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.
29398	1	a	Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .
29399	1	a	She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.
29400	1	a	As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.
29401	1	a	In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.
29402	1	a	There was no evidence of hemolysis.
29403	1	a	She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.
29404	1	a	There was no evidence of active bleeding.
29405	1	a	She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.
29406	1	a	She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.
29407	1	a	Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.
29408	1	a	Today, she feels reasonably well.
29409	1	a	She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.
29410	1	a	She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.
29411	1	a	She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.
29412	3	a	Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.
29413	1	a	Hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.
29414	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.

29461	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.
29462	1	a	General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.
29463	1	a	HEENT is unremarkable.
29464	1	a	Neck is supple.
29465	1	a	No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.
29466	1	a	Lungs are clear.
29467	1	a	Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs.
29468	1	a	Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly.
29469	1	a	Extremities without edema.
29470	1	a	LABORATORIES:  Drawn by the VNA on 01/04/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.
29471	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
29472	1	a	Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.
29473	1	a	She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.
29474	1	a	She will check daily weights.
29475	1	a	I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.
29476	1	a	Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.
29477	1	a	Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.
29478	1	a	Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.
29479	1	a	COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.
29480	1	a	We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.
29481	1	a	Chronic renal insufficiency.
29482	1	a	Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.
29483	1	a	She will need to be watched closely.
29484	1	a	She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.
29485	1	a	There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.
29486	1	a	I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.
29487	1	a	Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.
29488	1	a	She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.
29489	1	a	Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.
29490	1	a	She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.
29491	1	a	this might not be a bad idea.
29492	1	a	She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.
29493	1	a	GI.
29494	1	a	She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.
29495	1	a	Heme.
29496	1	a	Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.
29497	1	a	She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.
29498	1	a	She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.
29499	1	a	In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.
29500	1	a	If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.
29501	1	a	I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.
29502	1	a	Health care maintenance.
29503	1	a	Labs today.
29504	1	a	H1N1 vaccine today.
29505	1	a	Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.
29506	1	a	She wishes to be full code at present.
29507	1	a	I will see her again in 4 weeks.
29508	1	a	Visit length 60 minutes.

29684	1	a	In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation.
29685	1	a	His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria.

29687	1	a	In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.
29688	1	a	Over the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity.
29689	1	a	His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17.

29753	1	a	No charcots joints or ulcers in his legs or feet
29754	1	a	No cords or calf pain on palpation
29755	1	a	Stocking glove sensory neuropathy to vibration temperature and proprioception
29756	1	a	reflexes are normal
29757	1	a	Medications
29758	1	a	Glycuride 10am 5 pm
29759	1	a	Hctz 12.5 mg po qd
29760	1	a	Colace TID
29761	1	a	MSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.
29762	1	a	Prilosec 40
29763	1	a	Gabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid
29764	1	a	Disposition and Plans
29765	1	a	1.
29766	1	a	Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.
29767	1	a	I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.
29768	1	a	I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.
29769	1	a	His PSA is low and will continue to follow.
29770	1	a	If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out
29771	1	a	2.
29772	1	a	Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease.
29773	1	a	He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past.
29774	1	a	I will broach this issue next time again
29775	1	a	3.
29776	1	a	DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,.
29777	1	a	He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.
29778	1	a	Will check lipids.
29779	1	a	Will continue to monitor BP.
29780	1	a	Will start aspirin when he is willing.
29781	1	a	Plan to follow up with patient by email
29782	1	a	will see in clinic RTC in 3 months
29783	1	a	Eddie Zajac MD 94212

29842	1	a	Cardiovascular Medicine Consult Service Consult Note
29843	1	a	X. R. Xi, MD, PhD
29844	1	a	Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811
29845	1	a	Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098
29846	1	a	ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
29847	1	a	Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
29848	1	a	History of Present Illness:
29849	1	a	"	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery."
29850	1	a	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.
29851	1	a	If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
29852	1	a	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
29853	1	a	Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
29854	1	a	His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.
29855	1	a	A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
29856	1	a	There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
29857	1	a	The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).
29858	1	a	An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
29859	1	a	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
29860	1	a	He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
29861	1	a	He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.
29862	1	a	He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
29863	1	a	He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.
29864	1	a	His lasix dose has not changed.
29865	1	a	He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
29866	1	a	He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.
29867	1	a	A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.
29868	1	a	Past Medical History:
29869	1	a	Coronary artery disease

29953	1	a	Impression and Plan:
29954	1	a	This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
29955	1	a	The issues include:
29956	1	a	Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
29957	1	a	I would consider:
29958	1	a	increasing his diuretic (eg.
29959	1	a	Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
29960	1	a	Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
29961	1	a	He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
29962	1	a	consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
29963	1	a	consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
29964	1	a	Prevention of periperative MI
29965	1	a	He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
29966	1	a	No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
29967	1	a	Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
29968	1	a	Prevention of perioperative AF
29969	1	a	Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
29970	1	a	Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
29971	1	a	Endocarditis prophylaxis
29972	1	a	He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
29973	1	a	We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.

29983	1	a	Dear Whitney:
29984	1	a	  I was pleased to see Michelle Klein this morning for a post hospitalization followup evaluation.
29985	1	a	You know Michelle well, she does have coronary artery disease, has had an LAD stent placed in 2148, and had a normal stress sestamibi study in November 2151.
29986	1	a	She has moderate mitral insufficiency.
29987	1	a	Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42.
29988	3	a	She is diabetic and has hypertension.
29989	1	a	She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.
29990	1	a	Her medications were modified somewhat.
29991	1	a	She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID.
29992	1	a	Her blood pressure remains high today at 147/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year.
29993	1	a	Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change.
29994	1	a	She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.
29995	1	a	Her exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
29996	1	a	Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries.
29997	1	a	Clear lungs.
29998	1	a	Normal abdomen, nontender, and no mass felt.
29999	1	a	Her heart palpates normally.
30000	1	a	There were no thrills and no scars.
30001	1	a	Her first sound is soft and second is normal.
30002	1	a	There is a 1/6 apical mitral insufficiency murmur with positive response to isometrics.
30003	1	a	There were no diastolic murmurs.
30004	1	a	Blood pressure is 145/70.
30005	1	a	The electrocardiogram was normal with trace nonspecific ST flattening.
30006	1	a	I will plan to reassess Michelle in four months and she will have a recheck several times a month of her blood pressure at home and she will send diaries to me.
30007	1	a	If her blood pressure is continued at home to be in her present level, we will advance her medications to accommodate this.
30008	1	a	If there are any questions feel free to call me.

30055	1	a	Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 
30056	1	a	repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 
30057	1	a	essentially within normal limits.
30058	1	a	She denies any recurrent flank 
30059	1	a	pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.
30060	1	a	Says overall she is feeling

30070	1	a	pain of unclear etiology.
30071	1	a	Several days ago, she had an episode 
30072	1	a	that lasted a minute or two at rest.
30073	1	a	She described it as a 
30074	1	a	tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 
30075	1	a	nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.
30076	1	a	She has 
30077	1	a	no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 
30078	1	a	symptoms in the past few days.

30080	1	a	sugars at home as her machine is broken.
30081	1	a	Also, she self-
30082	1	a	discontinued her lisinopril.
30083	1	a	She thought it gave her a headache.
30084	1	a	Page 2
30085	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 
30086	1	a	distress.
30087	1	a	Pulse 68 and regular.
30088	1	a	Blood pressure 134/84 and 
30089	1	a	weight 226.
30090	1	a	Fingerstick today 198.
30091	1	a	Neck veins are non-elevated.
30092	1	a	No carotid bruits.
30093	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
30094	1	a	Lungs are clear to 
30095	1	a	auscultation bilaterally.
30096	1	a	Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.
30097	1	a	Normal S1 and S2.
30098	1	a	No murmurs.
30099	1	a	Extremities are warm and without 
30100	1	a	edema.
30101	1	a	Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 
30102	1	a	vibration and light touch.
30103	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 
30104	1	a	normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-
30105	1	a	waves.
30106	1	a	Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
30107	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
30108	1	a	problems as follows:
30109	1	a	Type 2 diabetes.
30110	1	a	Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
30111	0	a	the 9.0.
30112	1	a	She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
30113	1	a	try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
30114	1	a	At this point, it 
30115	1	a	is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
30116	1	a	regimen starting with b.i.d.
30117	1	a	NPH, and we will refer her to the 
30118	1	a	diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 
30119	1	a	with a plan to transition her at that time.
30120	1	a	Her urine 
30121	1	a	microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
30122	1	a	We will recheck 
30123	1	a	her hemoglobin A1c today.
30124	1	a	She has been to the ophthalmologist 
30125	1	a	recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
30126	1	a	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 
30127	1	a	pain is somewhat concerning.
30128	1	a	She does have coronary disease 
30129	1	a	as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
30130	1	a	She is taking an 
30131	1	a	aspirin and a beta-blocker.
30132	1	a	Her EKG today is normal, and she 
30133	1	a	has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
30134	1	a	exertion.
30135	1	a	Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 
30136	1	a	pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
30137	1	a	the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 
30138	1	a	and beta-blocker.
30139	1	a	I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
30140	1	a	ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
30141	1	a	referring her to Cardiology.
30142	1	a	"	06386371"
30143	1	a	"	11/24/94"
30144	1	a	"	Page 3"
30145	1	a	"	"
30146	1	a	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 
30147	1	a	prefer better blood pressure control.
30148	1	a	She agreed to try the 
30149	1	a	lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 
30150	1	a	thinks it disagrees with her.
30151	1	a	I told her I felt the headache 
30152	1	a	was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
30153	1	a	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 
30154	1	a	I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 
30155	1	a	today without receiving one.
30156	1	a	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

30496	1	a	"	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23"
30497	1	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
30498	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease.
30499	1	a	He has managed to lose 3 lbs.
30500	3	a	on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.
30501	1	a	His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.
30502	1	a	They both attribute it to the Prilosec.
30503	1	a	He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.
30504	1	a	He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.
30505	1	a	Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.
30506	1	a	No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.
30507	1	a	Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.
30508	1	a	On examination, he is well appearing.
30509	1	a	Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored.
30510	1	a	Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff.
30511	1	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
30512	1	a	Oropharynx is clear.
30513	1	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy.
30514	1	a	Back:  Normal configuration.
30515	1	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.
30516	1	a	Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.
30517	1	a	JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.
30518	1	a	Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
30519	1	a	Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.
30520	1	a	Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.
30521	1	a	My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.
30522	1	a	Impression:
30523	1	a	1.
30524	1	a	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.
30525	1	a	Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
30526	1	a	However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.
30527	1	a	There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.
30528	3	a	He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.
30529	1	a	2.
30530	1	a	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
30531	1	a	If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.
30532	1	a	3.
30533	1	a	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
30534	1	a	4.
30535	1	a	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.
30536	1	a	5.
30537	1	a	Chronic cough.
30538	1	a	6.
30539	3	a	Diabetes - Better controlled.
30540	1	a	7.
30541	1	a	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.
30542	1	a	As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.
30543	1	a	Recommendations:
30544	1	a	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d.
30545	1	a	dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.
30546	1	a	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
30547	1	a	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.
30548	1	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
30549	1	a	Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.
30550	1	a	Sincerely,

30558	1	a	RE: EGAN, VAL
30559	1	a	MRN: 8268084
30560	1	a	DOB: 07/30/2063
30561	1	a	Dear Dr. Rucker, 
30562	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Val in the office today.
30563	1	a	As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia.
30564	1	a	He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years.
30565	1	a	He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain.
30566	1	a	He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain.
30567	1	a	Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable.
30568	1	a	He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate.
30569	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma.
30570	1	a	MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin.
30571	1	a	ALLERGIES: None.
30572	1	a	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy.
30573	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.
30574	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory.
30575	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain.
30576	1	a	His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal.
30577	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia.
30578	1	a	The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging.
30579	1	a	I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression.
30580	1	a	He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression.
30581	1	a	I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered.
30582	1	a	A surgical consent was obtained.
30583	1	a	The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135.
30584	1	a	Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy.
30585	1	a	I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

30945	1	a	PLAN:
30946	1	a	1.
30947	3	a	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.
30948	1	a	This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.
30949	1	a	Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.
30950	1	a	Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.
30951	1	a	No debridement necessary.
30952	1	a	Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.
30953	1	a	Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.
30954	1	a	2.
30955	1	a	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.
30956	1	a	Monitor EKG and telemetry.
30957	1	a	If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.

31094	1	a	ID: Patient is now presenting with appears to be another episode of cellulitis but now probably coming from his L 5th Toe lesion.
31095	1	a	Surgery has debrided the wound, sending wound cultures as well as blood cultures.
31096	1	a	Acute OM would not be visible on XR changes and clinical picture is more consistent with acute than Chronic OM.
31097	1	a	Will consider further work up for OM if symptoms do not respond to treatment.
31098	1	a	Levo and flagyl were added to unasyn in accord to previous culture data.
31099	1	a	PVD: Will need arterial LENIS to assess for vascular patency and flow.
31100	1	a	Continuing ACEI, and adding ASA and lipitor, will order lipid profile and smoking cessation consult.
31101	3	a	DM2: Very poor control last admission, eventhough patient now says he takes medications and checks it up to QID.
31102	1	a	Will order HgbA1C and glucose monitoring.

31335	1	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
31336	3	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
31337	1	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
31338	1	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
31339	1	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
31340	1	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
31341	1	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
31342	1	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
31343	1	a	Recommendations:
31344	1	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
31345	1	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
31346	1	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
31347	1	a	-Continue statin.
31348	1	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

31356	1	a	Check blood sugars before meals and at bedtime.
31357	1	a	In addition, some meals you may want to check your blood sugar (blood glucose or BG) 1 hour after taking your Novolog.
31358	1	a	If it is over 150 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake.
31359	1	a	You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and/or days.
31360	1	a	For example: Sat check before and after breakfast; Friday - lunch; Thursday - supper,etc.

31586	3	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea.
31587	1	a	The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF.
31588	1	a	The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear.
31589	1	a	More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI.
31590	1	a	Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT.
31591	1	a	Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion.
31592	1	a	Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
31593	1	a	If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
31594	1	a	Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles.
31595	1	a	Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.
31596	1	a	Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

31932	3	a	male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr.
31933	1	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.
31934	1	a	Dr.
31935	1	a	Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.
31936	1	a	However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.
31937	1	a	Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.
31938	1	a	He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.
31939	1	a	Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.
31940	1	a	The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.
31941	1	a	However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.
31942	1	a	Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.

32231	1	a	ASSESSMENT
32232	1	a	33 y.o.
32233	1	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
32234	3	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
32235	1	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
32236	1	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
32237	3	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
32238	1	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
32239	3	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
32240	1	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
32241	1	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
32242	1	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
32243	1	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
32244	1	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
32245	1	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
32246	1	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
32247	1	a	No concentrated sweets diet
32248	1	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
32249	1	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
32250	1	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
32251	1	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
32252	1	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
32253	1	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

32265	3	a	   The patient is a 70 yo male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD.
32266	1	a	Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved.
32267	1	a	He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent.
32268	1	a	He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen.
32269	1	a	He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent.
32270	1	a	The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent.
32271	1	a	he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.

32774	1	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Follow-up laboratory testing.
32775	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old white
32776	1	a	man who I have not seen since November of 2088.
32777	1	a	Approximately
32778	1	a	four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.
32779	1	a	He saw colored
32780	1	a	spots floating in his visual field.
32781	1	a	He has been noting some
32782	1	a	decreased depth perception and visual acuity.
32783	1	a	At the same time,
32784	1	a	he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he
32785	1	a	believes were migraines.
32786	1	a	He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.
32787	1	a	He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation.
32788	1	a	Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits.
32789	1	a	However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which
32790	0	a	came back at 10.2.
32791	1	a	Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I
32792	1	a	had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly
32793	1	a	elevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.
32794	1	a	He
32795	1	a	never returned for that testing.
32796	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
32797	1	a	obesity, and gout.
32798	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o.

32800	1	a	b.i.d.,
32801	1	a	allopurinol 300 mg p.o.
32802	1	a	q.d.
32803	1	a	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
32804	3	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney
32805	1	a	failure.
32806	1	a	This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.
32807	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.
32808	1	a	He is
32809	1	a	currently on a leave of absence from work.
32810	1	a	He is a nonsmoker.
32811	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over
32812	1	a	the past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.
32813	1	a	He has been
32814	1	a	noting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and
32815	1	a	nocturia.
32816	1	a	Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,
32817	1	a	respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and
32818	1	a	dermatologic are negative.
32819	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white
32820	1	a	man in no acute distress.
32821	1	a	Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse
32822	1	a	66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.
32823	1	a	HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,
32824	1	a	anicteric sclerae.
32825	1	a	Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes.
32826	1	a	Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
32827	1	a	Chest: 
32828	1	a	CTA&P bilaterally.
32829	1	a	Heart: RRR, no MRG.
32830	1	a	Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
32831	1	a	NT/ND, NABS, no HSM.
32832	1	a	Extremities:  No CCE.
32833	1	a	Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+
32834	1	a	DTRs bilaterally.
32835	1	a	LABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per
32836	1	a	minute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.
32837	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
32838	1	a	1.
32839	3	a	Diabetes.
32840	1	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
32841	1	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
32842	3	a	diabetes.
32843	1	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to
32844	1	a	start him on metformin 500 mg p.o.
32845	1	a	Use and side effects
32846	1	a	were reviewed.
32847	1	a	He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and
32848	1	a	fasting lipid profile checked today.
32849	1	a	Unfortunately, he was not
32850	1	a	actually fasting.
32851	1	a	He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and
32852	1	a	Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education.
32853	1	a	He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.
32854	1	a	He is asked
32855	1	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
32856	1	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens
32857	3	a	swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.
32858	1	a	I assume that this
32859	1	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.
32860	1	a	was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job
32861	1	a	until his symptoms clear.
32862	1	a	2.
32863	1	a	Migraines.
32864	1	a	The patient does sound as if he is also having
32865	1	a	migraines.
32866	1	a	We will address this at future visits.

33145	1	a	Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.
33146	1	a	Plan:
33147	1	a	--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.
33148	1	a	--complete cycling enzymes
33149	1	a	--continue outpatient lasix dose.
33150	1	a	--adjust n/c oxygen as needed
33151	1	a	--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.
33152	1	a	--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.
33153	1	a	This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.
33154	3	a	--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

33158	1	a	-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

33314	1	a	RE:  Otis Narvaez
33315	1	a	     MR #045-61-32-6
33316	1	a	Dear Uddin:
33317	1	a	Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
33318	1	a	undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.
33319	1	a	His previous visit with me occurred on
33320	1	a	February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.
33321	1	a	He
33322	1	a	"denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion."
33323	1	a	This was not
33324	1	a	associated with activity.
33325	1	a	He admits to being a very sedentary person.
33326	1	a	The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
33327	1	a	LV function, and CT coronary angiography.
33328	1	a	There were no significant findings on the clinical
33329	1	a	evaluation.
33330	1	a	The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion.
33331	1	a	The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
33332	1	a	limiting stenosis.
33333	1	a	There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
33334	1	a	was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging.
33335	1	a	There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.
33336	1	a	The
33337	1	a	narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.
33338	1	a	A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
33339	1	a	cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
33340	1	a	342 mg/dl.
33341	1	a	He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.
33342	1	a	He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
33343	1	a	insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.
33344	1	a	Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.
33345	1	a	denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.
33346	1	a	His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
33347	1	a	Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
33348	1	a	Otis Narvaez
33349	1	a	MR #045-61-32-6
33350	1	a	Page 2
33351	1	a	aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.
33352	1	a	He usually takes these once every other day.
33353	1	a	He is
33354	1	a	now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.
33355	1	a	He takes this at bedtime.
33356	1	a	Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.
33357	1	a	This causes him
33358	1	a	to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.
33359	3	a	He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.
33360	1	a	He also has chronic low
33361	1	a	back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.
33362	1	a	He also has
33363	1	a	degenerative joint disease in his knees.
33364	1	a	He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
33365	1	a	depression.
33366	1	a	He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.
33367	1	a	On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
33368	1	a	cell carcinoma.
33369	1	a	On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.
33370	1	a	His
33371	1	a	weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
33372	1	a	the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.
33373	1	a	Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
33374	1	a	reveals upper dentures in place.
33375	1	a	There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear.
33376	1	a	There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.
33377	1	a	On cardiac examination, the heart
33378	1	a	sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
33379	1	a	rubs, or gallops.
33380	1	a	The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
33381	1	a	distal right calf.
33382	1	a	There is no edema noted.
33383	1	a	I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
33384	1	a	catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.
33385	1	a	He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
33386	1	a	Kraft will perform the procedure.
33387	1	a	His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
33388	1	a	catheterization.
33389	1	a	After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
33390	1	a	comprehensive metabolic profile performed.
33391	1	a	He will return to see me in the office again in one
33392	1	a	month.
33393	1	a	Best personal regards.
33394	1	a	Sincerely,
33395	1	a	Kenneth Z.

33407	1	a	To Dr. Estep:
33408	1	a	I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.
33409	1	a	Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
33410	1	a	Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.
33411	1	a	We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
33412	1	a	In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
33413	1	a	She recalls having only V2 clinical events.
33414	1	a	She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.
33415	1	a	She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
33416	1	a	This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
33417	1	a	There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.
33418	1	a	She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.
33419	1	a	She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.
33420	1	a	She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.
33421	1	a	She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
33422	1	a	Moreover, she does not have claudication.
33423	1	a	Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.
33424	1	a	She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

33455	1	a	Current Medical Therapy:
33456	1	a	Aggrenox 25/200 p.o.
33457	1	a	b.i.d.
33458	1	a	Prilosec 20 mg p.o.
33459	1	a	daily.
33460	1	a	Doxepin 25 mg daily.
33461	1	a	Simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
33462	1	a	Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
33463	1	a	Fosamax 70 mg every week.
33464	1	a	BLANK 1 tab daily.
33465	1	a	Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.
33466	1	a	Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.
33467	1	a	She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.
33468	1	a	Social History:  This woman is single.
33469	1	a	She is a retired Secretary.
33470	1	a	She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.
33471	1	a	She has no other history of substance abuse.
33472	1	a	Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.
33473	1	a	She has no other new symptoms.
33474	1	a	There is no recent GI bleeding.
33475	1	a	She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.
33476	1	a	On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.
33477	1	a	Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.
33478	1	a	Head and neck exam is unremarkable.
33479	1	a	There are no carotid bruits.
33480	1	a	She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
33481	1	a	Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
33482	1	a	Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
33483	1	a	Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
33484	1	a	Her apex beat is within normal limits.
33485	1	a	Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
33486	1	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
33487	1	a	There are no obvious masses.
33488	1	a	Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
33489	1	a	Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.
33490	1	a	They are symmetrical.
33491	1	a	Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.
33492	1	a	A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
33493	1	a	Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
33494	1	a	We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
33495	1	a	(It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).
33496	1	a	Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.
33497	1	a	If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.
33498	1	a	Her hypertension is controlled today.
33499	1	a	Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
33500	1	a	However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o.
33501	0	a	We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.
33502	1	a	It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
33503	1	a	She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
33504	1	a	We recommend.
33505	1	a	We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
33506	1	a	We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
33507	1	a	daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
33508	1	a	We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
33509	1	a	We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.
33510	1	a	We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

33525	1	a	RE:  Urania Yerger
33526	1	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
33527	1	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
33528	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first
33529	1	a	time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her
33530	1	a	coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in
33531	1	a	October of this year.
33532	1	a	Though you know her history well, I will
33533	1	a	recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
33534	1	a	Ms. Yerger is
33535	1	a	presently 81 years old.
33536	1	a	Her vascular risk factors include
33537	3	a	diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.
33538	1	a	She had no prior diagnosis
33539	1	a	of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash
33540	1	a	pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST
33541	1	a	elevation myocardial infarction.
33542	1	a	Coronary angiography at the
33543	1	a	Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,
33544	1	a	thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent
33545	1	a	complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal
33546	1	a	as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
33547	1	a	Angiography also
33548	1	a	revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.
33549	1	a	The patient underwent
33550	1	a	subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed
33551	1	a	by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
33552	1	a	(SVG to
33553	1	a	ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).
33554	1	a	Ms. Yerger's postoperative
33555	1	a	course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient
33556	1	a	episode of atrial fibrillation.
33557	1	a	Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of
33558	1	a	activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending
33559	1	a	shopping trips.
33560	1	a	Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve.
33561	1	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.
33562	1	a	She has
33563	1	a	had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein
33564	1	a	graft harvesting.
33565	1	a	She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA
33566	1	a	symptoms or claudication.
33567	1	a	Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
33568	1	a	Ms.
33569	1	a	Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on
33570	1	a	her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a
33571	1	a	possible viral exanthem.
33572	1	a	Yerger, Urania
33573	1	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078
33574	1	a	Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency
33575	1	a	(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and
33576	1	a	prior right knee replacement.
33577	1	a	Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.
33578	1	a	day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril
33579	1	a	5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.
33580	1	a	day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.
33581	1	a	Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family
33582	1	a	members in the area.
33583	1	a	She is currently staying with her daughter.
33584	1	a	At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but
33585	1	a	is limited by chronic knee pain.
33586	1	a	She denies alcohol or tobacco
33587	1	a	use.
33588	1	a	Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.
33589	1	a	On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.
33590	1	a	She is
33591	1	a	comfortable seated on the exam table.
33592	1	a	Her skin is warm and dry.
33593	1	a	She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly
33594	1	a	on her extremities.
33595	1	a	Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate
33596	1	a	is in the 70's.
33597	1	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
33598	1	a	Her
33599	1	a	carotids are 2+ without bruits.
33600	1	a	Her chest reveals decreased breath
33601	1	a	sounds at the left base.
33602	1	a	There are no crackles or wheezes.
33603	1	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and
33604	1	a	rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased.
33605	1	a	There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the
33606	1	a	apex.
33607	1	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
33608	1	a	Her extremities are free
33609	1	a	of cyanosis or clubbing.
33610	1	a	Distal pulses are 1+.
33611	1	a	She has mild edema
33612	1	a	of the left lower extremity.
33613	1	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and
33614	1	a	intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
33615	1	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after
33616	1	a	her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
33617	1	a	October.
33618	1	a	Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
33619	1	a	persistent pleural effusion.
33620	1	a	We will reevaluate today with a
33621	1	a	repeat chest x-ray.
33622	1	a	In the meantime, I think that we should
33623	1	a	continue her oral diuretic regimen.
33624	1	a	It is possible that her
33625	1	a	persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
33626	1	a	Although not certain to
33627	1	a	be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today
33628	1	a	in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
33629	1	a	resolve.
33630	1	a	I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
33631	1	a	We
33632	1	a	will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for
33633	1	a	secondary prevention.
33634	1	a	I look forward to seeing her again in
33635	1	a	approximately eight to twelve weeks.
33636	1	a	In addition, she will follow-
33637	1	a	up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
33638	1	a	persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
33639	1	a	symptoms.
33640	1	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078
33641	1	a	It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.
33642	1	a	Please do
33643	1	a	not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

33685	1	a	Chief Complaint: 
33686	1	a	Shortness of breath
33687	1	a	History of The Present Illness:  
33688	3	a	"	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath."
33689	1	a	He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis.
33690	1	a	He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication.
33691	1	a	His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper.
33692	1	a	He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.
33693	1	a	On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness.
33694	1	a	He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.
33695	1	a	This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted.
33696	1	a	The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths.
33697	1	a	He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day.
33698	1	a	This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath.
33699	1	a	He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

33811	1	a	Assessment/Plan:
33812	3	a	"	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal."
33813	1	a	His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure.
33814	1	a	He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema.
33815	1	a	However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.
33816	1	a	His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event.
33817	3	a	His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.

33864	1	a	Overnight in the SDU, patient was given several stepwise doses of lasix.
33865	1	a	She put out about 500cc to 30 IV lasix, then another 300cc to 40 IV lasix.
33866	1	a	Patient was hypoxic on a NRB with sats in low 90s and RR of 45, but improved when transitioned to high flow O2 with saturation in high 90s and RR of 30.
33867	1	a	Bedside TTE done in the morning confirmed aortic valve leaflet vegetations and moderate AI.
33868	1	a	CT surgery was consulted, and given prior hx of angina and recent episodes of chest pain, they requested cardiac cath prior to OR for valve replacement.
33869	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

34716	1	a	   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o.
34717	1	a	male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.
34718	1	a	Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection.
34719	1	a	His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.
34720	1	a	Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss.
34721	1	a	During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.
34722	1	a	His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake.
34723	1	a	Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition.
34724	1	a	He was discharged without incident on 12/30.
34725	1	a	The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months.
34726	1	a	He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.
34727	1	a	Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations.
34728	1	a	He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6.
34729	1	a	At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.
34730	1	a	A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.
34731	1	a	Case was discussed with Dr. Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment.

35282	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.
35283	1	a	In general, he is in no acute distress.
35284	1	a	The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.
35285	1	a	The oropharynx is clear.
35286	1	a	Neck is supple.
35287	1	a	There is no lymphadenopathy.
35288	1	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.
35289	1	a	Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
35290	1	a	The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.
35291	1	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
35292	1	a	The extremities show no edema.
35293	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
35294	1	a	1.
35295	0	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
35296	1	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
35297	1	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
35298	1	a	2.
35299	1	a	BPH.
35300	1	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
35301	1	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
35302	1	a	3.
35303	1	a	Hypertension.
35304	1	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
35305	1	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
35306	1	a	4.
35307	1	a	COPD.
35308	1	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
35309	1	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
35310	1	a	5.
35311	1	a	Elevated cholesterol.
35312	1	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
35313	1	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
35314	1	a	6.
35315	1	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
35316	1	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
35317	3	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
35318	1	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

35334	1	a	DOB:               3/22/68
35335	1	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
35336	1	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
35337	1	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
35338	1	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
35339	1	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
35340	1	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
35341	1	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
35342	1	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
35343	1	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
35344	1	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
35345	1	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
35346	1	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
35347	1	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
35348	1	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
35349	1	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
35350	1	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
35351	1	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
35352	3	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
35353	1	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
35354	1	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
35355	1	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
35356	1	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
35357	1	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
35358	1	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
35359	1	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
35360	1	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
35361	1	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
35362	1	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
35363	1	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
35364	1	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
35365	1	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
35366	1	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
35367	1	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
35368	1	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
35369	1	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
35370	1	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
35371	1	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
35372	1	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
35373	1	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
35374	1	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
35375	1	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
35376	1	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
35377	1	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
35378	1	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
35379	1	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
35380	1	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
35381	1	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
35382	1	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
35383	1	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
35384	1	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
35385	1	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
35386	1	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
35387	1	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
35388	1	a	Sincerely,
35389	1	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

35398	1	a	RE: Otis Narvaez
35399	1	a	        MR   #04561326
35400	1	a	Dear Dr. Huynh:
35401	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 
35402	1	a	consultation.
35403	1	a	As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 
35404	3	a	of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
35405	1	a	Recently, he underwent 
35406	1	a	evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 
35407	1	a	dobutamine stress echocardiography.
35408	1	a	The echocardiogram revealed reduced 
35409	1	a	left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.
35410	1	a	There was no evidence of ischemia.
35411	1	a	He subsequently underwent coronary 
35412	1	a	catheterization.
35413	1	a	I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 
35414	1	a	told that he had no arterial blockages.
35415	1	a	Symptomatically, he is 
35416	1	a	significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.
35417	1	a	He has attributed 
35418	1	a	this to his weight.
35419	1	a	He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 
35420	1	a	although he has not been taking either of these medications.
35421	1	a	Prior to 
35422	1	a	his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 
35423	1	a	upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.
35424	1	a	This was confirmed 
35425	1	a	subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 
35426	1	a	lung malignancy.
35427	1	a	He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 
35428	1	a	you.
35429	3	a	His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 
35430	1	a	back pain, and obesity.
35431	1	a	Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 
35432	1	a	q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.
35433	1	a	No drug allergies
35434	1	a	Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.
35435	1	a	Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.
35436	1	a	He smoked for 
35437	1	a	40 years but quit approximately three years ago.
35438	1	a	He drinks rarely, 
35439	1	a	although drank heavily in the past.
35440	1	a	       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 
35441	1	a	December 30,  2072                                         
35442	1	a	Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.
35443	1	a	He denies 
35444	1	a	gastrointestinal complaints.
35445	1	a	On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 
35446	1	a	140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.
35447	1	a	HEENT is unremarkable, neck 
35448	1	a	supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 
35449	1	a	without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 
35450	1	a	regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 
35451	1	a	murmurs or rubs.
35452	1	a	Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 
35453	1	a	CVA tenderness.
35454	1	a	No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
35455	1	a	Pulses full.
35456	1	a	Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 
35457	1	a	function by echocardiogram.
35458	1	a	By report he has no evidence of coronary 
35459	1	a	artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.
35460	1	a	If indeed 
35461	1	a	it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 
35462	1	a	this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 
35463	3	a	his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.
35464	1	a	In any case, this 
35465	1	a	puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 
35466	1	a	than if he had significant coronary disease.
35467	1	a	I see no reason why you 
35468	1	a	should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.
35469	1	a	Prior 
35470	1	a	to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.
35471	1	a	I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 
35472	1	a	to South Side Hospital.
35473	1	a	Sincerely yours,
35474	1	a	Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.

35762	1	a	   coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of syncope
35763	1	a	"	Interval History:"
35764	3	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
35765	1	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
35766	1	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
35767	1	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
35768	1	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
35769	1	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
35770	1	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
35771	1	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
35772	1	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
35773	1	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
35774	1	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
35775	1	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
35776	1	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
35777	1	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
35778	1	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
35779	1	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
35780	1	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.
35781	1	a	Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

35924	1	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
35925	3	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo woman with a hx of schizophrenia, DM2, HTN, HL presenting with confusion and hyponatremia.
35926	1	a	Patient states over the past 2 days she has felt confused and weak, citing that when someone would call she was unable to speak.
35927	1	a	She also has felt unsteady on her feet and fell twice yesterday when out walking, hitting her face and arm.
35928	1	a	She reports dizziness prior to fall but denies chest pain, palpitations or SOB.
35929	1	a	There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall.
35930	1	a	Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke.
35931	1	a	She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight.
35932	1	a	She has not had any recent medication changes.
35933	1	a	She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.
35934	1	a	She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.
35935	1	a	She also reports SOB with exertion, particularly walking up stairs.
35936	1	a	In the ED initial VS were T 99.2  HR 98  BP 173/93  RR 22.
35937	1	a	Labs were significant for a Na 118, K 3.5, Cl 82, CO2 17.5, AG 19, WBC 15, Hct 32.
35938	1	a	CXR was clear.

35997	1	a	RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES
35998	1	a	CXR - No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
35999	1	a	EKG &#8211; Sinus tachycardia.
36000	1	a	Rate 106.
36001	1	a	Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3.
36002	1	a	Slightly changed from prior.
36003	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
36004	3	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
36005	1	a	She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.
36006	1	a	##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
36007	1	a	Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.
36008	1	a	A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
36009	1	a	Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.
36010	1	a	Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
36011	1	a	Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.
36012	1	a	Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
36013	1	a	Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
36014	1	a	Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
36015	1	a	Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion
36016	1	a	Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
36017	1	a	##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
36018	1	a	Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.
36019	1	a	Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
36020	1	a	Check orthostatics
36021	1	a	Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.
36022	1	a	Monitor on telemetry.
36023	1	a	Physical therapy consult.
36024	1	a	##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.
36025	1	a	Fe, TIBC, ferritin
36026	1	a	Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia
36027	1	a	##: Elevated anion gap.
36028	1	a	Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.
36029	1	a	Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.
36030	1	a	There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.
36031	1	a	pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.
36032	1	a	AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).
36033	1	a	Check lactate
36034	1	a	Repeat AG
36035	1	a	##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.
36036	1	a	UA and CXR were negative.
36037	1	a	If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.
36038	1	a	Repeat CBC
36039	3	a	##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide
36040	1	a	Finger sticks AC with RISS
36041	1	a	##: Schizophrenia &#8211; continue trilafon
36042	1	a	##: Insomnia &#8211; continue seroquel, ambient
36043	1	a	##: Hypertension &#8211; continue avapro, labetalol, norvasc, spironolactone, aspirin
36044	1	a	##: Hyperlipidemia &#8211; continue simvastatin
36045	1	a	FEN: 1L fluid restriction, no caffeine.
36046	1	a	Aggressively replete K, phos and recheck lytes Q6H.

36413	1	a	This patient of Dr. Bridges was seen because Dr. Bridges was
36414	1	a	called away on an emergency basis.
36415	1	a	His major concern is results of recent vascular studies.
36416	1	a	He has
36417	3	a	known diabetes and has a history of several years of exertional
36418	1	a	cramping and discomfort in his legs.
36419	1	a	This occurs only with heavy
36420	1	a	exertion.
36421	1	a	Dr. Bridges documented normal pedal pulses the last
36422	1	a	visit.
36423	1	a	His recent vascular studies showed no significant drop off and
36424	1	a	perfusion pressures level of the ankle.
36425	1	a	Did given his history a more inclined to suspect this might be
36426	1	a	pseudoclaudication due to neuropathy or spinal stenosis.
36427	1	a	He will
36428	1	a	follow up with Dr. Bridges about next steps.
36429	1	a	Ret he declines a flu shot today.

36437	1	a	We are consulted by Dr. Bonilla for assistance with glycemic management.
36438	1	a	Mr. Ervin is a 67 y/o gentleman who is presently POD # 1 after AVR and 2V CABG.
36439	1	a	He had known calcific AS and presented with increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
36440	1	a	He was subsequently found to have worsening AS and CAD, including LM disease.
36441	1	a	His peri-operative course has been notable for hyperglycemia with maximum BG 252.
36442	1	a	He was started on an insulin  infusion according to the Portland Protocol and remains on 0.5-2 units/hour since midnight with BS 117-134-163-151-125-137-98-99.
36443	3	a	Mr. Ervin recalls having been diagnosed with DM at the age of 19 as part of a military physical.
36444	1	a	He was overweight and was placed on dietary therapy.
36445	3	a	"Per his own report his DM was diet controlled and ""seemed to disappear"" several years after initial diagnosis."
36446	1	a	Approximately 4 years ago he experienced blurry vision and was again noted to have elevated BGs (he is uncertain of the magnitude of the BG elevation).
36447	1	a	He resumed dietary therapy and has achieved good control with a  pre-op A1c of 6.2.
36448	1	a	He is followed at the Skiff.
36449	1	a	He has never been on insulin or OHAs and denies knowledge of diabetic complications.
36450	1	a	He checks BS at home sporadically which are usually in the low-mid 100s.
36451	1	a	He says when he experiences hyperglycemic symptoms (i.e.
36452	1	a	occasional nocturia) he walks to bring down his blood sugar.
36453	1	a	In general he is active, walking several miles/day.
36454	3	a	Past Medical History: HTN, AS, DM2 as above
36455	1	a	Current Medications: Insulin, K/Mg, ASA, Toradol, Zofran, Vanco, Carafate
36456	1	a	Social History: remote tobacco, ETOH
36457	3	a	Famiy History: Son with DM1,  Grandmother with DM
36458	1	a	ROS: Denies HA or changes in vision.
36459	1	a	+SOB PTA.
36460	1	a	No abdominal pain or changes in bowels.
36461	1	a	No dysuria, occasional nocturia.
36462	1	a	No recent lower extremity swelling.
36463	1	a	Remainder of review of systems is negative or as per HPI.
36464	1	a	Physical Exam:
36465	1	a	Vitals: 98.2 70 120/68
36466	1	a	Gen: pleasant, heavy set (but muscular) gentleman in NAD
36467	1	a	HEENT: NC/AT EOMI
36468	1	a	Neck: supple central venous line in place
36469	1	a	CV: distant HS
36470	1	a	Chest: wound intact
36471	1	a	Lungs: Clear anteriorly
36472	1	a	Abd: S/NT

36475	1	a	Skin: intact
36476	1	a	Labs: pre-op A1c 6.2.
36477	1	a	Prior A1c 7.2 in 4/73
36478	1	a	A/P 
36479	3	a	Mr. Ervin has DM2 which was adequately controlled pre-operatively with diet and exercise.
36480	1	a	He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.
36481	1	a	Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.
36482	1	a	The goal is to maintain BS<175.
36483	1	a	He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.
36484	1	a	At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.
36485	3	a	He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.
36486	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
36487	1	a	Our team will follow with you.

36742	1	a	Date of Admission: 3/18/91
36743	1	a	CC: STEMI
36744	1	a	HPI: 
36745	3	a	79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI.
36746	1	a	It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday.
36747	1	a	She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV.
36748	1	a	She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress.
36749	1	a	ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection.
36750	2	a	Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.
36751	1	a	On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow.
36752	1	a	Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most.
36753	1	a	LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.
36754	1	a	A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.
36755	1	a	On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr.
36756	1	a	Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012.
36757	1	a	Her Temp.
36758	1	a	was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission.
36759	1	a	She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K.
36760	1	a	Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP.
36761	1	a	Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr.
36762	1	a	When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin.
36763	1	a	The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

37355	1	a	Date of Evaluation:  12/13/78
37356	1	a	Attending:  Dr. Atwood
37357	1	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
37358	1	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
37359	1	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
37360	1	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
37361	1	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
37362	1	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
37363	1	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
37364	1	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
37365	1	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

37580	1	a	Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.
37581	1	a	Pt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis.
37582	1	a	Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral.
37583	1	a	If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.
37584	1	a	Seems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain.
37585	1	a	Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.
37586	1	a	Will obtain cardiology review for CAD.
37587	1	a	Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume.
37588	1	a	If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.

38486	1	a	Assessment and Plan:
38487	3	a	53 yoM with hx of morbid obesity, CHF,  HTN, COPD, DM type 2, OSA, p/w increasing SOB and abdominal discomfort.
38488	1	a	SOB: Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare (due to lasix discontinuation, BNP 1326) and COPD (PFT in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit).
38489	1	a	CXR showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with CHF.
38490	1	a	Started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs.
38491	1	a	Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE.
38492	1	a	In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.
38493	1	a	Cardiac enzymes negative.
38494	1	a	CHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction.
38495	1	a	Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI.
38496	1	a	Reinitiated Lasix.
38497	1	a	HTN: patient here normotensive.
38498	1	a	Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block.
38499	1	a	Will consider switching to ACEI.
38500	1	a	OSA: Patient on home oxygen.
38501	1	a	Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP
38502	3	a	Diabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.
38503	1	a	Abdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing.
38504	1	a	Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide.
38505	1	a	Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.
38506	1	a	Rectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy.
38507	1	a	Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity.
38508	1	a	Groin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection.
38509	1	a	Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult.
38510	1	a	RLE ulcer: Granulating leg ulcer, Will continue topical care.

38524	3	a	Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis
38525	3	a	HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22.
38526	1	a	Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080.
38527	1	a	Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes.
38528	1	a	Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.
38529	1	a	After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid.
38530	0	a	HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081.
38531	1	a	On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting.
38532	1	a	Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her.
38533	0	a	Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID.
38534	1	a	Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease.
38535	1	a	Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial.
38536	1	a	She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
38537	1	a	She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management.
38538	1	a	On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID.
38539	1	a	Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse.
38540	1	a	Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse.
38541	1	a	Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.
38542	1	a	Written only for insulin sliding scale.
38543	1	a	Glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.

38628	3	a	Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition.
38629	1	a	Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20.
38630	1	a	Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.
38631	1	a	Abdominal pain can be multifactorial.
38632	1	a	I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease.
38633	1	a	With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility.
38634	1	a	Recommendations: 
38635	1	a	"1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility."
38636	1	a	a.
38637	1	a	Would not hold long acting insulin.
38638	1	a	Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO
38639	1	a	b.
38640	1	a	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started.
38641	1	a	If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.
38642	1	a	"c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:"
38643	1	a	"i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units."
38644	1	a	"d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner."
38645	1	a	Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
38646	1	a	She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
38647	1	a	"e.	No metformin for now given GI upset."
38648	1	a	"2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace."
38649	1	a	"3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac."
38650	1	a	Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina.
38651	1	a	Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
38652	1	a	I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.
38653	1	a	"4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response."
38654	1	a	Thank you for the consult.
38655	1	a	We will follow with you.
38656	1	a	Please call with any questions.

38802	1	a	NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
38803	1	a	MRN:     8514931
38804	3	a	The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,
38805	1	a	hyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems.
38806	1	a	She has a history of TIAs and
38807	1	a	was seeing the neurologist today for follow up.
38808	1	a	She has not had recent TIA symptoms
38809	1	a	but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.
38810	1	a	Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she
38811	1	a	has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she
38812	1	a	walks about one block.
38813	1	a	The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both
38814	1	a	sides of her chest.
38815	1	a	It is not severe, sharp chest pain.
38816	1	a	It does not radiate to her back.
38817	1	a	There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain.
38818	1	a	No PND, orthopnea or edema.
38819	1	a	The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago.
38820	1	a	She has a history of TIAs and our
38821	1	a	goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a
38822	1	a	low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.
38823	1	a	She is on aspirin and Plavix.
38824	1	a	She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.
38825	1	a	She has not had a recent stress test.
38826	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress.
38827	1	a	Her blood
38828	1	a	pressure is 160/70.
38829	1	a	Neck supple without JVD or bruits.
38830	1	a	Lungs clear without wheezes,
38831	1	a	rales or rhonchi.
38832	1	a	Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur
38833	1	a	or gallop.
38834	1	a	Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
38835	1	a	No edema.
38836	1	a	Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
38837	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story
38838	1	a	which sounds convincing for exertional angina.
38839	1	a	She has not had any symptoms in over
38840	1	a	two weeks.
38841	1	a	Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
38842	1	a	b.i.d.
38843	1	a	She should stop it if she
38844	1	a	feels lightheaded on the medication.
38845	1	a	She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d.
38846	1	a	We
38847	1	a	will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT.
38848	1	a	She will follow-up in one week.

38865	1	a	At the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet.
38866	1	a	Per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.
38867	1	a	Course at the outside hospital- 
38868	1	a	1.Neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of T8.
38869	1	a	Per Neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, Sx were concerning for aortic dissection.
38870	1	a	Abd US unrevealing but was reported as a poor study.
38871	1	a	CT of T8-T10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.
38872	1	a	2.GI- Coffee ground emesis at OSH, with no fresh blood- with dropping HCT 44-40-35 and transfused 1 U pRBC on 12/11.
38873	1	a	Also guiac +.
38874	1	a	Etiology thought to be 2/2 ASA and plavix.
38875	1	a	No egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and LFTs were nl per report.
38876	1	a	3.ID- Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, In setting of elevated WBC to 22 pt was empirically treated with Abx (zosyn, flagyl and vanc).
38877	1	a	BCx were sent and CXR appeared clear.
38878	1	a	4.CARDIAC- Cardiac enzymes were followed with increasing Troponins: 0.04    0.07    0.08    0.09, CK index: 3.0    3.7.
38879	1	a	No complaints of chest pain during his stay.

38882	1	a	Pt transferred to HOB for further eval of r/o dissection, r/o cord compression, GIB, poss abd ischemia, ARI/CRI
38883	1	a	Review of System on admission: 
38884	1	a	CV: no orthopnea, no PND
38885	1	a	Resp: sob, no cough, no sputum production 
38886	1	a	GI: abdominal pain as above, no melena, no BRBPR, able to have BM
38887	1	a	GU: per OSH ED report of dark urine in ileostomy bag x2d with decreased UOP
38888	1	a	Musculoskeletal: baseline decreased to minimal movement in the LLE, min-mod movement in right leg, able to transfer to and from wheelchair
38889	1	a	Neuro/Psych: alert and oriented x3.
38890	1	a	MICU Course:
38891	1	a	1.Paraplegia:  Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6.
38892	1	a	- first MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10.
38893	1	a	-no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
38894	1	a	-neurosurg, neuro consulted, following
38895	1	a	2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic
38896	1	a	- s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%.
38897	1	a	3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure.
38898	1	a	- urine eos negative
38899	1	a	- Cr 2.9-->2.5 today
38900	1	a	4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state.
38901	1	a	However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
38902	1	a	- have liberalized bp parameters now that dissection ruled out
38903	1	a	5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. sentinel bleeding
38904	1	a	-GI team consulted
38905	1	a	6.Coronary artery disease:
38906	1	a	- troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
38907	1	a	- taken off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
38908	1	a	- cont lopressor 
38909	1	a	- hydral, isordil, goal SBP 140-150
38910	1	a	7.Hemodynamics:
38911	1	a	- TEE with no dissection
38912	1	a	- TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
38913	1	a	- metoprolol +/- isordil/hydral

39449	1	a	Patient Name: YOUNT, PATRICIA;  MRN: 4711083
39450	1	a	Dictated on: 10/24/2088 by YOEL NEWCOMB, M.D.
39451	1	a	Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.
39452	1	a	She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.
39453	1	a	Brought her in to have an evaluation.
39454	1	a	X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.
39455	3	a	Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.
39456	1	a	No prior surgeries.
39457	1	a	No medications.
39458	1	a	No known drug allergies.
39459	1	a	Lists no family history of any problems.
39460	1	a	Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.
39461	1	a	On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.
39462	1	a	No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.
39463	1	a	Negative scaphoid shift test.
39464	1	a	Slight tenderness over the distal radius.
39465	1	a	Normal tendon function.
39466	1	a	My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

39517	3	a	The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.
39518	1	a	She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.
39519	1	a	She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.
39520	1	a	The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.
39521	1	a	Blood sugars are often 60 or less.
39522	1	a	The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.
39523	1	a	Physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.
39524	1	a	Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.

39530	1	a	Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.
39531	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
39532	1	a	1.
39533	1	a	Diabetes mellitus.
39534	1	a	The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.
39535	1	a	The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.
39536	1	a	I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.
39537	1	a	Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.
39538	1	a	2.
39539	1	a	Chronic renal failure.
39540	1	a	The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.
39541	1	a	She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.
39542	1	a	3.
39543	1	a	Tendonitis, right middle finger.
39544	1	a	After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.
39545	1	a	The patient tolerated the procedure well.
39546	1	a	4.
39547	1	a	Anemia.
39548	1	a	This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.
39549	1	a	She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.
39550	1	a	We will check CBC today.
39551	1	a	5.
39552	1	a	Right shoulder pain.
39553	1	a	The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.
39554	1	a	6.
39555	1	a	Regular healthcare maintenance.
39556	1	a	The patient will follow up with me in about two months.

39851	1	a	I advised the patient to return to the clinic in

39853	1	a	months and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his 
39854	1	a	blood sugars are under better control.

40138	1	a	,  
40139	1	a	Dear Dr.  Osuna:
40140	1	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.
40141	1	a	As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.
40142	1	a	He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.
40143	1	a	He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.
40144	1	a	He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.
40145	1	a	He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.
40146	1	a	He says that most of this is because of inactivity.
40147	1	a	He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.
40148	1	a	Past medical history:
40149	3	a	   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.

40189	1	a	Procedures:
40190	1	a	Echocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.
40191	1	a	which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.
40192	1	a	There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.
40193	1	a	Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080.
40194	1	a	He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.
40195	1	a	There was no evidence of ischemia.

40204	1	a	He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.
40205	1	a	He has a fairly good LV function.
40206	1	a	There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.
40207	1	a	He is on a good medical regimen.
40208	1	a	Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.
40209	1	a	He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.
40210	1	a	He does have some trace pedal edema.
40211	1	a	His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.
40212	1	a	I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.
40213	1	a	My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.
40214	1	a	Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

40513	1	a	Dear Dr. Mcmahon:
40514	1	a	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.
40515	3	a	He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.
40516	1	a	Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.
40517	1	a	The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.
40518	1	a	The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.
40519	1	a	There were no complications.
40520	1	a	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.
40521	1	a	His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.
40522	1	a	Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.
40523	1	a	Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.
40524	1	a	He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
40525	1	a	He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.
40526	1	a	His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.
40527	1	a	He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.
40528	1	a	Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.
40529	1	a	Please call if you have questions.
40530	1	a	Sincerely,

40545	3	a	HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.
40546	1	a	Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.
40547	1	a	He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.
40548	1	a	Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.
40549	1	a	His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.
40550	1	a	He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.
40551	1	a	The Pt sleeps on one pillow.
40552	1	a	During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.
40553	1	a	These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.
40554	1	a	Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.
40555	1	a	He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.
40556	1	a	The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.

40558	1	a	On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.
40559	1	a	He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.
40560	1	a	At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.

40562	1	a	At NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L
40563	1	a	The Pt received ASA 325mg PO.
40564	1	a	Since receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.
40565	1	a	The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).

40683	1	a	No evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease.
40684	1	a	Echo (6/93):  EF 60%, symmetric LVH
40685	3	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
40686	1	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
40687	1	a	Although, there were no 
40688	1	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
40689	1	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
40690	1	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
40691	1	a	However, Pt 
40692	1	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
40693	1	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
40694	1	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
40695	1	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
40696	1	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
40697	1	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
40698	1	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
40699	1	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
40700	1	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
40701	1	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
40702	1	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
40703	1	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
40704	1	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
40705	1	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
40706	1	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
40707	1	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
40708	1	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.
40709	3	a	"3)	DM - Sugars elevated."
40710	1	a	Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.
40711	1	a	"4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable."
40712	1	a	Cont home medication of Lipitor.
40713	1	a	"5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet."
40714	1	a	Consider a diabetic diet as well.
40715	1	a	"6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized."

40718	1	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
40719	1	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
40720	1	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
40721	1	a	Briefly:
40722	3	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
40723	1	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
40724	1	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
40725	1	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
40726	1	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
40727	1	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
40728	1	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
40729	1	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
40730	1	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

40892	1	a	Location:  59H
40893	1	a	Reason for Admission:  Dysphagia
40894	3	a	HPI: Ms. Fay is a 69 year-old woman with diabetes who presented from home with an approximately 2 month history of progressive dysphagia, solid and liquid.
40895	1	a	About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling.
40896	1	a	The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone.
40897	1	a	She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery.
40898	1	a	Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well.
40899	1	a	No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel.
40900	2	a	She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.
40901	1	a	In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
40902	1	a	She was evaluated by the GI department.
40903	1	a	A screening HIV test was negative.
40904	1	a	She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes.
40905	1	a	The above findings prompted admission for further workup.

40947	1	a	RADIOLOGY: None
40948	1	a	ECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG
40949	3	a	IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
40950	1	a	The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia.
40951	1	a	Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out.
40952	1	a	The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable.
40953	1	a	Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms.
40954	1	a	ECG warrants following.
40955	3	a	Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.
40956	1	a	CV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker
40957	1	a	Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn
40958	1	a	GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi
40959	3	a	Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted.
40960	1	a	Check HbA1c, TFTs
40961	1	a	FEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet
40962	1	a	Infectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection

41299	1	a	Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.
41300	1	a	We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.
41301	1	a	Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.
41302	1	a	In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.
41303	1	a	She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.
41304	1	a	Her next appointment is in January.
41305	2	a	HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.
41306	1	a	Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.
41307	1	a	For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. 
41308	1	a	========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================
41309	1	a	Discussed with Dr. Freddie Eric.
41310	3	a	66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM.
41311	1	a	Recent admission for R/O MI.
41312	0	a	A1C was in the 9s.
41313	1	a	Being followed by Internal Medicine.
41314	1	a	Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding.
41315	1	a	It would appear that she is having anxiety.

41781	1	a	Attending Oncologist: Dr. Xavier Otero
41782	1	a	PCP:  Dr. Geno Guidry
41783	1	a	Code Status: Full Code
41784	1	a	ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.
41785	1	a	Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.
41786	1	a	Past medical records.
41787	1	a	History of Present Illness  
41788	3	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
41789	1	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
41790	1	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
41791	1	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
41792	1	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
41793	1	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
41794	1	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
41795	1	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
41796	1	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
41797	1	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
41798	1	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
41799	1	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
41800	1	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
41801	1	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.
41802	1	a	He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.
41803	1	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
41804	1	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
41805	1	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
41806	1	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
41807	1	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
41808	1	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
41809	1	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
41810	1	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
41811	1	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
41812	1	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
41813	1	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
41814	1	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
41815	1	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
41816	1	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
41817	1	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
41818	1	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.

42006	1	a	_____________________________________________________________________________________
42007	1	a	I/P: 
42008	1	a	73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
42009	1	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
42010	1	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
42011	1	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
42012	1	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
42013	1	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
42014	1	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
42015	1	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
42016	1	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
42017	1	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.
42018	1	a	a.
42019	1	a	Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.
42020	1	a	"b.	Sputum gram stain and culture"
42021	1	a	"c.	Blood cultures"
42022	1	a	"d.	Pneumococcus antigen screening"
42023	1	a	"e.	U/A, urine Legionella"
42024	1	a	"f.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
42025	1	a	If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.
42026	1	a	"g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea."
42027	1	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
42028	1	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
42029	1	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
42030	1	a	hypoglycemia).
42031	1	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
42032	1	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
42033	1	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
42034	1	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
42035	1	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
42036	1	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
42037	1	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
42038	1	a	b.
42039	1	a	Check orthostatics daily.
42040	1	a	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.
42041	1	a	Has been on Taxotere for the last six months.
42042	1	a	Patient does not know of new findings, to discuss with Dr. Otero in AM.
42043	1	a	Consider alternative therapies.
42044	1	a	Anemia: Patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV=73).
42045	1	a	Not known to be iron-deficient.
42046	1	a	Iron studies (Iron, Ferritin, TIBC) to assess iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease.
42047	1	a	"b.	Guaiac stool for evidence of occult blood."
42048	1	a	HTN:  
42049	1	a	Patient is stable on current regimen.
42050	1	a	No changes to medications.
42051	1	a	CAD/hypercholesterolemia:
42052	1	a	Continue with Lipitor 10 mg daily
42053	1	a	"b.	Cardiac enzymes negative times one."
42054	1	a	Per Oncology fellow, no need to cycle given stability of TW changes in EKG and lack of anginal symptoms
42055	1	a	"c.	Low fat diet"
42056	1	a	7.
42057	1	a	Renal vein thrombosis: 
42058	1	a	Stable on Coumadin.
42059	1	a	"b.	Clarify goal INR level."
42060	1	a	Currently INR=3.4.
42061	1	a	Prophylaxis:
42062	1	a	"a.	Nexium for GI prophylaxis"
42063	1	a	"b.	Colace/Mylanta for constipation."
42064	1	a	"c.	Low-fat, no added salt, no concentrated sugar diet."
42065	1	a	"d.	Finger sticks after each meal."

42073	1	a	"He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of ""room spinning"" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea."
42074	1	a	His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea.
42075	1	a	Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L.  He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.
42076	1	a	Will treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP.
42077	1	a	Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED).
42078	1	a	Check orthostatics.
42079	1	a	IVF gentle hydration.
42080	1	a	Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.
42081	1	a	Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.
42082	1	a	EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.
42083	1	a	Will treat nausea symptomatically.
42084	1	a	Discussed with onc fellow (Dr. Kramer).

42133	1	a	Carotid artery stenosis.
42134	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 88 mcg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, Aricept 10 mg a day, furosemide 20 mg a day, nifedipine 90 mg a day, Crestor 20 mg a day, metoprolol 25 mg a day, calcium, Zetia 10 mg a day, vitamin D, Nephrocaps 1 mg a day, fish oil, aspirin 81 mg a day.
42135	1	a	ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.
42136	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.
42137	1	a	She does not drink.
42138	1	a	She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.
42139	1	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.
42140	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
42141	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.
42142	1	a	Her O2 saturation is 95%.
42143	1	a	Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.
42144	1	a	Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.
42145	1	a	Her nares are without discharge.
42146	1	a	Oropharynx with dentures.
42147	1	a	She has no erythema or exudate.
42148	1	a	Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.
42149	1	a	Her thorax is kyphotic.
42150	1	a	She has normal fremitus and percussion.
42151	1	a	Her lungs are clear.
42152	1	a	Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.
42153	1	a	Abdomen is soft.
42154	1	a	Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
42155	1	a	She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.
42156	1	a	She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.
42157	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.
42158	1	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.
42159	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.
42160	1	a	This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
42161	1	a	At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
42162	1	a	Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
42163	1	a	She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
42164	1	a	I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
42165	1	a	She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
42166	1	a	She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
42167	1	a	Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.
42168	1	a	If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

42187	1	a	Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar 
42188	1	a	control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects 
42189	1	a	on her living situation.
42190	1	a	PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post 
42191	1	a	renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a 
42192	1	a	mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair 
42193	1	a	and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been 
42194	1	a	treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.
42195	1	a	She also is 
42196	3	a	insulin-dependent diabetic.
42197	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Her medications currently include:
42198	1	a	1.
42199	1	a	Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
42200	1	a	2.
42201	1	a	Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening.

42206	1	a	5.
42207	1	a	Tums Extra-Strength.
42208	1	a	6.   digoxin 0.25 and 0125.
42209	1	a	7.
42210	1	a	Mevacor 40 a day.
42211	1	a	8.
42212	1	a	Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg.
42213	1	a	9.
42214	1	a	Imuran 100mg a day.
42215	1	a	10.  prednisone 20mg every other day.
42216	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
42217	1	a	more active.
42218	1	a	She is able to walk around her house without her walker.
42219	1	a	She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.
42220	1	a	She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and 
42221	1	a	preparing meals.
42222	1	a	She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with 
42223	1	a	managing her medications.
42224	1	a	She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
42225	1	a	her with this.
42226	1	a	She has not been out of the house much in the last 
42227	1	a	several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to 
42228	1	a	get behind the wheel.
42229	1	a	The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of 
42230	1	a	breath, no change in her bowel or bladder.
42231	1	a	HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite 
42232	1	a	has been good.
42233	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
42234	1	a	with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.
42235	1	a	Her weight is 104 lbs.
42236	1	a	Her blood pressure today is 130/72.
42237	1	a	Her pulse is 80 and regular today.
42238	1	a	She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.
42239	1	a	IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
42240	1	a	her current regimen and medications.
42241	1	a	We have been manipulating her 
42242	1	a	32 Weld St                             Bird, Terri
42243	1	a	Page 2
42244	1	a	Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 
42245	1	a	2.5, earlier this week.
42246	1	a	She will continue on her current medications, 
42247	1	a	as noted above.
42248	1	a	The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
42249	1	a	mental status.
42250	1	a	She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
42251	1	a	over the last several months.
42252	1	a	She is anxious to drive.
42253	1	a	However, 
42254	1	a	everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
42255	1	a	nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.
42256	1	a	I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in 
42257	1	a	management of her own medications.
42258	1	a	Hence, our three goals that we set 
42259	1	a	today were:
42260	1	a	Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing 
42261	1	a	     six months ago.
42262	1	a	To get out of the house at least once a week, using either 
42263	1	a	     community transportation or a family member.
42264	1	a	To be doing the family's laundry each week.
42265	1	a	While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
42266	1	a	drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that 
42267	1	a	we set.
42268	1	a	Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing 
42269	1	a	with these goals.
42270	1	a	As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse 
42271	1	a	see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

42280	1	a	NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
42281	1	a	MRN:       8514931
42282	1	a	The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up.
42283	1	a	She has been having
42284	1	a	symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
42285	1	a	clear history of her symptoms.
42286	1	a	At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
42287	1	a	fall over to her right side.
42288	1	a	There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
42289	1	a	symptoms.
42290	1	a	She has not actually had syncope.
42291	1	a	There is no positional component to her
42292	1	a	I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms.
42293	1	a	The
42294	1	a	MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
42295	1	a	ovale and bilateral pontine region.
42296	1	a	She had small chronic lacunar infarcts.
42297	1	a	She reports
42298	1	a	that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
42299	1	a	would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms.
42300	1	a	She had some left internal carotid
42301	1	a	mild 30% proximal stenosis.
42302	1	a	Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.
42303	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts.
42304	1	a	Most likely related to hypertension rather
42305	1	a	than embolic disease.
42306	1	a	Her blood pressure has been very well controlled.
42307	1	a	In fact, today
42308	1	a	on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60.
42309	1	a	She brought her medications with her and
42310	1	a	has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o.
42311	1	a	q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
42312	1	a	hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o.
42313	1	a	q.d.
42314	1	a	She had not taken her medications today and
42315	1	a	her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
42316	1	a	the left.
42317	1	a	Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
42318	1	a	Her lungs are clear without
42319	1	a	wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
42320	1	a	Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
42321	1	a	S1, S2.
42322	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension.
42323	1	a	Now with lower blood
42324	1	a	pressure and some lightheadedness.
42325	1	a	We will d/c her atenolol.
42326	1	a	I would like her to get a
42327	1	a	repeat blood pressure in one week.
42328	1	a	I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
42329	1	a	Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
42330	3	a	diabetes.
42331	1	a	She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

42339	1	a	Re:  Verna Cantu
42340	1	a	ESH #:033-98-74
42341	1	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.
42342	3	a	As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.
42343	1	a	We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.
42344	1	a	She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.
42345	1	a	She is walking each day.
42346	1	a	Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.
42347	1	a	She has no complaints of pain.
42348	1	a	She is eating well.
42349	1	a	She is sleeping well.
42350	1	a	Her incisions have healed nicely.
42351	1	a	Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.
42352	1	a	Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.
42353	1	a	I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.
42354	1	a	Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

42365	1	a	MRN#: 8841350
42366	1	a	Attending: Uriel Mays MD
42367	1	a	Code status: DNR/DNI per discussion with son
42368	1	a	Historian: medical record, patient's son Ursula Jacks
42369	1	a	Chief Complaint: agitation
42370	1	a	HPI: 
42371	1	a	Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.
42372	1	a	As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.
42373	1	a	The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.
42374	1	a	Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.
42375	1	a	They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.
42376	1	a	He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.
42377	1	a	His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.
42378	1	a	His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.
42379	1	a	They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady.
42380	1	a	About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.
42381	1	a	Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.
42382	1	a	They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.
42383	1	a	Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.
42384	1	a	They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.
42385	1	a	They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.
42386	1	a	In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.
42387	1	a	Exam was notable only for rales bilaterally and mild-moderate agitation.
42388	1	a	CXR was normal.
42389	1	a	CBC was at baseline.
42390	1	a	UA pending.
42391	1	a	CT brain could not be performed due to agitation.
42392	1	a	They spoke to his PCP who felt this was all due to progression of his dementia.
42393	1	a	He was given ativan 2mg IV (total) and haldol 5mg IV (total).
42394	1	a	Also got labetalol PO 200mg PO x 1.

42403	1	a	Lung Nodule: increase in size of lung nodule when CT repeated in Feb (suspicious for BAC) Son Ursula spoke to Dr. Daniel (per son's report) and they discussed observing and not being aggressive with surgery etc as even though it could be cancer, an invasive operation, considering his multiple other problems, could be much worse for him than simple observation.
42404	1	a	They have an appt with Dr. Daniel in September.

42725	1	a	PATIENT:  Umstead, Kenneth
42726	1	a	MRN:  9544546
42727	1	a	ADMIT DATE: 7/02/84 
42728	1	a	ATTENDING: Vernon Toth
42729	1	a	PCP:  Vernon Toth
42730	1	a	CONTACT:  Valeria Umstead (056) 216-7457
42731	1	a	CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks
42732	1	a	HPI:  
42733	1	a	Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.
42734	1	a	Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.
42735	1	a	He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.
42736	1	a	This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.
42737	1	a	He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits.
42738	1	a	He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.
42739	1	a	No new incontinence.
42740	1	a	This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.
42741	1	a	ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative.

42822	1	a	ASSESSMENT & PLAN
42823	1	a	87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.
42824	1	a	The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
42825	1	a	Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.
42826	1	a	Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
42827	1	a	However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.
42828	1	a	Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
42829	1	a	As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
42830	1	a	LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
42831	1	a	One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.
42832	1	a	A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
42833	1	a	Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly.
42834	1	a	However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
42835	1	a	Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative.
42836	1	a	CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
42837	1	a	Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
42838	1	a	will d/w attending
42839	1	a	consider psychiatric consult
42840	1	a	Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
42841	1	a	Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH
42842	1	a	H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.
42843	3	a	NIDDM: Will start RISS
42844	1	a	Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD
42845	1	a	HTN: metoprolol
42846	1	a	Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.
42847	1	a	Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

42898	1	a	CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis
42899	3	a	HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
42900	1	a	This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time.
42901	3	a	Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074.
42902	1	a	Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG.
42903	1	a	In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal.
42904	1	a	She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD.
42905	1	a	She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.
42906	1	a	Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position.
42907	1	a	She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea.
42908	1	a	She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain.
42909	1	a	Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.
42910	3	a	PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression

43281	1	a	IMPRESSION:           1.
43282	1	a	Urothelial thickening involving renal pelvises, ureters, and     bladder.
43283	1	a	Findings consistent with infection versus less likely     inflammation.

43285	1	a	Bladder calculus.
43286	1	a	3.
43287	1	a	Abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased since prior study, may be     consistent with progression of known sarcoid, versus malignancy.

43291	1	a	IMPRESSION:     1.
43292	1	a	Mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.
43293	1	a	Bilateral adrenal nodules.
43294	1	a	"Path: 04/10/2102 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"" (including FSA):     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).B."
43295	1	a	"SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"":     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE)."
43296	1	a	Impression:  Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.
43297	1	a	Cx data was not obtained.
43298	1	a	However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.
43299	1	a	Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.
43300	1	a	At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.
43301	1	a	At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.
43302	1	a	Recommendations:  
43303	1	a	-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
43304	1	a	-Would recommend checking PPD
43305	1	a	-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.
43306	1	a	Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.
43307	1	a	There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.
43308	1	a	-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.
43309	1	a	1 DS M/W/F.
43310	1	a	-Will follow.
43311	1	a	Thank you for this interesting consult.
43312	1	a	Please call with questions.
43313	1	a	Patient seen examine and case discussed with Dr. Layton.

43414	1	a	Record date: 2064-07-17
43415	1	a	Name:  Xochilt Vuong
43416	1	a	MRN:  6398353
43417	1	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.
43418	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 
43419	1	a	going back more than 10 years.
43420	1	a	She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 
43421	1	a	over approximately the same period of time.
43422	1	a	She has a complicated history 
43423	1	a	including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.
43424	1	a	Her 
43425	1	a	creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 
43426	1	a	1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 
43427	1	a	obtained on July 06, 2064.
43428	1	a	She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.
43429	1	a	Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 
43430	1	a	at 81.
43431	1	a	Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 
43432	1	a	proteinuria since that time.
43433	1	a	Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 
43434	1	a	March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 
43435	1	a	obstruction, stones, or masses.
43436	1	a	She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
43437	1	a	She does 
43438	3	a	not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 
43439	1	a	for any proliferative retinopathy.
43440	1	a	Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 
43441	1	a	almost constant nausea.
43442	1	a	She vomits rarely.
43443	1	a	Her weight has fallen by about 20 
43444	1	a	pounds.
43445	1	a	She is slightly constipated.
43446	1	a	She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.
43447	1	a	She 
43448	1	a	is not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.
43449	1	a	"Her medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, ""statins,"" and a rather "
43450	1	a	large dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.

43470	1	a	Prilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID
43471	1	a	Lipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD 
43472	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 
43473	1	a	reasonably comfortable.
43474	1	a	She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 
43475	1	a	which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
43476	1	a	Her blood pressure in 
43477	1	a	the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.
43478	1	a	Her chest has a few basal 
43479	1	a	crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
43480	1	a	JVP fills below the 
43481	1	a	sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 
43482	1	a	sternal border.
43483	1	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
43484	1	a	There is no renal tenderness.
43485	1	a	Extremities have no edema.
43486	1	a	IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
43487	3	a	10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
43488	1	a	The 
43489	1	a	proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 
43490	1	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
43491	1	a	It would be useful to know 
43492	1	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
43493	1	a	It is, of course, also 
43494	1	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
43495	1	a	Their symmetry and 
43496	1	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
43497	1	a	The ACE 
43498	1	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
43499	1	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
43500	1	a	Her loss of appetite and 
43501	1	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
43502	1	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
43503	3	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
43504	1	a	hyperlipidemia.
43505	1	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
43506	1	a	It think it 
43507	1	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
43508	1	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
43509	1	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
43510	1	a	If, of course, shortness of 
43511	1	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
43512	1	a	reasonable.
43513	1	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
43514	1	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
43515	1	a	requirement for Lasix.
43516	1	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
43517	1	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
43518	1	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
43519	1	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
43520	1	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
43521	1	a	Aranesp).
43522	1	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
43523	1	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
43524	1	a	If so, the 
43525	1	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
43526	1	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
43527	1	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
43528	1	a	It would 
43529	1	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
43530	1	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
43531	1	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
43532	1	a	a need for it arises.
43533	1	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
43534	1	a	done in the next few months.
43535	1	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
43536	1	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
43537	1	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
43538	1	a	these measures as necessary.
43539	1	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
43540	1	a	Wanda
43541	1	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
43542	1	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
43543	1	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
43544	1	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

44078	1	a	Post, IN  86454
44079	1	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
44080	1	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
44081	1	a	As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.
44082	1	a	He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.
44083	1	a	Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.
44084	1	a	Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.
44085	1	a	He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.
44086	1	a	He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.
44087	1	a	Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.
44088	1	a	He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.
44089	1	a	Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
44090	1	a	As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.
44091	1	a	He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.
44092	1	a	He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
44093	1	a	Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).
44094	1	a	Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
44095	1	a	He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
44096	1	a	His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o.
44097	1	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
44098	1	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
44099	1	a	daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o.
44100	1	a	daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o.
44101	1	a	daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
44102	1	a	daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily.
44103	1	a	He has no known drug allergies.
44104	1	a	Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.
44105	1	a	He is in no distress.
44106	1	a	Weight is 221 lbs.
44107	1	a	Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.
44108	1	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.
44109	1	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
44110	1	a	His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
44111	1	a	He had no peripheral edema.
44112	1	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
44113	1	a	He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.
44114	1	a	EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.
44115	1	a	We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
44116	1	a	He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
44117	1	a	His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL.
44118	1	a	His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.
44119	0	a	HbA1c is 7.2%.
44120	1	a	The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.
44121	1	a	Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
44122	1	a	To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:
44123	1	a	1.
44124	1	a	Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.
44125	1	a	2.
44126	1	a	Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.
44127	1	a	Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
44128	1	a	3.
44129	1	a	He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.
44130	1	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.
44131	1	a	As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.
44132	1	a	The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.
44133	1	a	Yours sincerely,
44134	1	a	______________________________

44151	1	a	His R TMA has healed well since then.
44152	1	a	He is also s/p L fem-pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm.
44153	1	a	He saw Dr. Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left, however on the right he appears to have a high-grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft.
44154	1	a	The more distal graft on the right, which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent.
44155	1	a	He denies recent h/o fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal pain, or neurological sx.

44240	1	a	SYMPTOMS
44241	1	a	FINDINGS
44242	1	a	The inflow (the left  mid superficial femoral artery)  is patent.
44243	1	a	The 
44244	1	a	proximal anastomosis is widely patent.
44245	1	a	The proximal, mid- and distal graft is
44246	1	a	  widely patent.
44247	1	a	The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 
44248	1	a	(below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 
44249	1	a	velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis.
44250	1	a	The distal native ( posterior 
44251	1	a	tibial artery)  is patent.
44252	1	a	IMPRESSION
44253	1	a	1.
44254	1	a	Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 
44255	1	a	knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis
44256	1	a	2.
44257	1	a	The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a 
44258	1	a	compromised graft.
44259	1	a	CXR-lungs clear, heart size upper limit of normal.
44260	3	a	A/P:  67M w/ a h/o HTN, HL, DM, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneursyms s/p L fem-pop bpg; R popliteal thrombosis and subsequent R fem-pop bpg, R PT to plantar bpg and R TMA; presents with stenosis of the distal anastamosis of his femoral popliteal graft on the Right.
44261	1	a	He will undergo angiogram with possible angioplasty of graft stenosis.

44450	1	a	Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
44451	3	a	diagnosed type II diabetes.
44452	1	a	He has been very compliant with his 
44453	1	a	medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
44454	1	a	and NPH 
44455	1	a	insulin subQ q.AM.
44456	1	a	He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
44457	1	a	check his blood sugar at the time.
44458	1	a	He has not had any frank 
44459	1	a	palpitations or lightheadedness.
44460	1	a	He did have 1 episode where he had the 
44461	1	a	sensation of several extra heart beats.
44462	1	a	This was not accompanied by 
44463	1	a	other symptoms including no chest pain.
44464	1	a	He has never had a fingerstick 
44465	1	a	blood glucose below the mid 150's.
44466	1	a	I am looking through his log and see 
44467	1	a	that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
44468	1	a	dinner they have been between 157-296.
44469	1	a	He has already met several times 
44470	3	a	with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
44471	1	a	therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
44472	1	a	diabetic diet.
44473	1	a	On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
44474	1	a	pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
44475	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars.
44476	1	a	I will increase his 
44477	1	a	insulin regimen.
44478	1	a	He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
44479	1	a	new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
44480	1	a	before bedtime.
44481	1	a	And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
44482	1	a	and 
44483	1	a	I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
44484	1	a	syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.
44485	1	a	He is to follow up with me in 
44486	1	a	several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.
44487	1	a	I have 
44488	1	a	advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
44489	1	a	his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
44490	1	a	symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
44491	1	a	at that time as well.

44620	1	a	Vascular studies done today, OSH: 
44621	1	a	patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft with markedly reduced flow, toe-brachial index 0.0 &#8211; confirmed with PVR in UMH ED
44622	1	a	Assessment/Plan:
44623	1	a	The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.
44624	1	a	His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis.
44625	1	a	He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.
44626	1	a	Plan:
44627	1	a	-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr
44628	1	a	-          Home meds
44629	1	a	-          NPO past midnight
44630	1	a	-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99
44631	1	a	-          Plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05
44632	1	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Francis Pratt, Vascular Surgery Fellow.

45009	1	a	DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES GRANULOMAS/SARCOIDOSIS.
45010	1	a	ISOLATED LYMPHOMA IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION.
45011	1	a	ON IMAGING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE THESE PATHOLOGIES.
45012	1	a	TWO DISCRETE LESIONS IN THE POSTERIOR CORTEX OF RIGHT KIDNEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR SOLID RENAL MASS OR HYPERDENSE CYST.
45013	1	a	Assessment/Plan: 
45014	3	a	"	This is a 79 year old woman with past medical history of DM-2, chronic immunosuppresion (steroid use), RA, HTN, h/o leg ulcers, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, who presents with a 1 week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema, without other symptomatic complaints, that has been resistant to po treatment"
45015	1	a	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.
45016	1	a	Other potential causes include osteo or DVT.
45017	1	a	At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.
45018	1	a	a.
45019	1	a	Blood cultures
45020	1	a	b.
45021	1	a	Given her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45)
45022	1	a	"c.	Elevate the leg"
45023	1	a	"d.	Warm compresses to increased circulation"
45024	1	a	"e.	Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy"
45025	1	a	"f.	If cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection."
45026	1	a	Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT.
45027	1	a	Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad.
45028	1	a	She apparently had a negative PPD last year.
45029	1	a	Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass
45030	1	a	Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy
45031	1	a	Will stop ASA, plavix and celebrex in anticipation of the biopsy
45032	1	a	"c.	Continue to monitor fever curve"
45033	3	a	Diabetes - patient is taking in normal diet, however in the setting of infection, will  put of home meds and do RISS/FSG
45034	1	a	HTN - continue Lisinopril
45035	1	a	RA - continue Prednisone and Methotrexate 
45036	1	a	Blood cultures (in the setting of patient's infection)
45037	1	a	Monitor fever curve and other vitals signs carefully
45038	1	a	Adrenal insufficiency - given patient's long term history of steroid use, she will need stress doses if becomes more acutely ill
45039	1	a	Prophylaxis - Nexium 20 qd; Fragmin 2500 U sc qd
45040	1	a	"Code - DNI but wants chest compressions ""for a while""."

45174	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.
45175	0	a	I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.
45176	3	a	So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.
45177	1	a	We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.
45178	1	a	These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.
45179	3	a	He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.
45180	1	a	He had no other complaints.
45181	1	a	His bowel movements are regular.
45182	1	a	He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.
45183	1	a	He otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.
45184	1	a	His social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded.
45185	1	a	There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.
45186	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 140/60.
45187	1	a	He looks well.
45188	1	a	I did not measure his weight.
45189	1	a	His heart rate was around 64-68.
45190	1	a	His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full.
45191	1	a	Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal.
45192	1	a	Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.
45193	1	a	Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs.
45194	1	a	Liver and spleen were not palpable.
45195	1	a	He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.
45196	3	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper.
45197	1	a	He will come back to see me in about a month's time to follow up on these issues.
45198	1	a	CAD is stable with pacemaker
45199	1	a	HGB A1c is 7.0, Hct is down to 31.6, epo 37, creatinine stable at 1.6, MCV 93.3.

45217	1	a	Har is a 43 year old 6' 214 pound gentleman who is referred for
45218	1	a	consultation by Dr. Harlan Oneil.
45219	1	a	About a week ago he slipped on
45220	1	a	the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle.
45221	1	a	He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a
45222	1	a	fracture.
45223	1	a	He was placed in an air splint and advised to be
45224	1	a	partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.
45225	1	a	He is here for
45226	1	a	routine follow-up.
45227	1	a	Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously.
45228	3	a	He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.
45229	1	a	He takes Prozac,
45230	1	a	Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.
45231	1	a	He is also followed by Dr. Harold
45232	1	a	Nutter for an arrhythmia.
45233	1	a	He does not smoke.
45234	1	a	He drinks
45235	1	a	minimally.
45236	1	a	He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
45237	1	a	On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
45238	1	a	about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.
45239	1	a	The malleolus is
45240	1	a	non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
45241	1	a	either.
45242	1	a	Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain.
45243	1	a	There is no significant swelling.
45244	1	a	There are no some skin changes
45245	1	a	with some small abrasions proximally.
45246	1	a	There is no fibular
45247	1	a	tenderness proximally.
45248	1	a	No anterior pain is noted.
45249	1	a	No hindfoot,
45250	1	a	midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted.
45251	1	a	I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.
45252	1	a	He is
45253	1	a	using a cane for ambulation.
45254	1	a	His x-rays do not show a notable
45255	1	a	fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion.
45256	1	a	I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.
45257	1	a	I will
45258	1	a	see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office.
45259	1	a	Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

45463	1	a	(584) 728-8734
45464	1	a	SUBJECTIVE:  The patient comes in stating that she has had 5
45465	1	a	"days of substernal pain like a ""ball pressing in on her"
45466	1	a	"chest."""
45467	1	a	She has also had abdominal pain and has felt quite
45468	1	a	poorly.
45469	1	a	She did call this service this past weekend she
45470	1	a	states and never received a call back.
45471	1	a	She called me this
45472	1	a	morning, and I saw her immediately.
45473	1	a	The pain has not gone
45474	1	a	down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.
45475	1	a	She
45476	1	a	feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
45477	1	a	says that her blood sugars have been quite high.
45478	1	a	She does
45479	3	a	have diabetes.
45480	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.
45481	1	a	Her
45482	1	a	blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a
45483	1	a	pulse of 64.
45484	1	a	Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal
45485	1	a	without bruit.
45486	1	a	Heart is not enlarged.
45487	1	a	There is a regular
45488	1	a	sinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.
45489	1	a	Liver and spleen
45490	1	a	are not felt.
45491	1	a	EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
45492	1	a	myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
45493	1	a	last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
45494	1	a	precordium.
45495	1	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction.
45496	1	a	Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
45497	1	a	think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
45498	1	a	ward and attend her there.

45659	3	a	CC: 79 yo man hx depression, psychosis, insomnia, CAD, syncope, HTN, DMT2, carotid stenosis, PVD, here for PCP and f/u of these and other chronic health problems
45660	1	a	HPI: Patient recently presented to BMH with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac.
45661	1	a	No seizure activity.
45662	1	a	He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month.
45663	1	a	Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma.
45664	1	a	He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf.
45665	1	a	WMA and LA dilation.
45666	1	a	Cardiology was therefore consulted.
45667	1	a	An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf.
45668	1	a	lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV.
45669	1	a	The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic.
45670	1	a	An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21.
45671	1	a	Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.
45672	1	a	In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months.
45673	1	a	Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention.
45674	1	a	Endocrine w/u included nl TSH and cortstim.
45675	1	a	The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess.

45677	1	a	The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen.
45678	1	a	"Just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (""I lost my mortal soul"")."
45679	1	a	Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged
45680	1	a	hospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions.
45681	1	a	It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.
45682	1	a	Hospitalization done on Psych floor.
45683	1	a	Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy.
45684	1	a	The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell.
45685	1	a	He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him.
45686	1	a	He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead.
45687	1	a	He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.
45688	1	a	On the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS.
45689	1	a	Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.
45690	1	a	The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg.
45691	1	a	At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.
45692	1	a	"He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief ""most of the time."
45693	1	a	Neuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment.
45694	1	a	He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention.
45695	1	a	He had very poor learning of new information.
45696	1	a	Pt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital
45697	1	a	Psychiatry scheduled for the following day.
45698	1	a	He has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess.
45699	1	a	Today, patient reports improved mood, no longer feels down, no longer feels guilty, as though in hell.
45700	1	a	Has continued to taper down Zyprexa to 3.75mg QHS.
45701	1	a	Saw Dr. Nobles on Wednesday, felt that patient should continue to stay on low dose Zyprexa for now.

45970	1	a	DATE OF Consultation: 3/08/76
45971	1	a	PATIENT ID: Mr. Quin is a 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 met with pain who is seen for consideration of radiation therapy.
45972	1	a	HPI:  
45973	1	a	Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).
45974	1	a	He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.
45975	1	a	His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.
45976	1	a	The patient recalls 37 treatments.
45977	1	a	The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.
45978	1	a	He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5.
45979	1	a	In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.
45980	1	a	He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.
45981	1	a	His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.
45982	1	a	He is incontinent from his surgery.
45983	1	a	In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).
45984	1	a	The patient's LLP worsened.
45985	1	a	He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.
45986	1	a	On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.
45987	1	a	The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room.
45988	1	a	Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.
45989	1	a	ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.
45990	1	a	MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.
45991	1	a	No compression of the thecal sac.
45992	1	a	Mr. Quin reports improved pain since admission.
45993	1	a	He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther.

46287	1	a	1st degree AV block.
46288	1	a	Left axis deviation with likely left anterior fascicular block.
46289	1	a	No priors available for comparison.
46290	1	a	Imaging:
46291	1	a	Chest X-Ray: No evidence of pneumonia.
46292	1	a	Hip films: Impacted, displaced fracture of the left femoral neck with longitudinal extension of fracture into the intertrochanteric proximal femur.
46293	1	a	TTE 6/77: Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm.
46294	1	a	Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve.
46295	1	a	Normal LV cavity with EF 64%.
46296	1	a	Normal RV function with RVSP 44.
46297	1	a	Impression:
46298	1	a	Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history.
46299	1	a	Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure.
46300	1	a	Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital.
46301	1	a	Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history.
46302	1	a	This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.
46303	1	a	Recommendations:
46304	1	a	-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100
46305	1	a	-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively
46306	1	a	-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID
46307	1	a	-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery.
46308	1	a	Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive
46309	1	a	Thank you for this interesting consult.
46310	1	a	To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

46923	1	a	The right kidney is without evidence of hydronephrosis.
46924	1	a	There is an echogenicity in the right renal cortex compatible with chronic renal medical disease.
46925	1	a	Last CT was in 12/94 and showed bilateral stability of stents, no obvious processUnderlying obstruction.
46926	1	a	A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction managed with chronic indwelling stents, the etiology which is unclear, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia and a presumed UTI.
46927	1	a	His ureteral stents were last changed 12/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction; in 12/94, left RPG showed hydroureter to UVJ and on the right a distal ureteral stricture was noted at the UVJ.
46928	1	a	Difficult management issue since fails to follow-up and is normally cared for during acute episode admissions.
46929	1	a	We recommend:
46930	1	a	F/U UCx and continue empiric treatment; managed by ID in the past and their services may be helpful if he doesn&#8217;t respond at present.
46931	1	a	Continue hydration and treatment for hyperkalemia/ARF; may benefit from renal consult given h/o RTA
46932	1	a	F/U RUS to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
46933	1	a	Left kidney not well visualized at last US.
46934	1	a	Depending on the results of this study, consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
46935	1	a	Needs to be medically optimized prior to undergoing anaesthesia.

47075	1	a	He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which
47076	1	a	did radiate to his left shoulder.
47077	1	a	This seemed to resolve
47078	1	a	spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind
47079	1	a	of exertion at all.
47080	1	a	The shortness of breath was exclusively
47081	1	a	exertional.
47082	1	a	He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
47083	1	a	presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.
47084	1	a	No fevers.
47085	1	a	He does have a
47086	1	a	slight cough that is nonproductive.
47087	1	a	He was seen at a local
47088	1	a	Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as
47089	1	a	well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states
47090	1	a	he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.
47091	1	a	He was
47092	1	a	cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his
47093	1	a	cardiologist at SAH.
47094	1	a	Additionally, at the outside Emergency
47095	1	a	Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,
47096	1	a	but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.
47097	1	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally
47098	3	a	controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter.
47099	1	a	He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.
47100	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of
47101	1	a	smoking.
47102	1	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,
47103	1	a	otherwise negative.
47104	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,
47105	1	a	glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.
47106	1	a	ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.
47107	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate
47108	1	a	20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
47109	1	a	HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
47110	1	a	Pleasant, calm.
47111	1	a	Neck is
47112	1	a	supple.
47113	1	a	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for
47114	1	a	scattered rales in the left lower lung field.
47115	1	a	Cardiovascular: 
47116	1	a	Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
47117	1	a	Abdomen is soft and
47118	1	a	nontender.
47119	1	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
47120	1	a	Extremities:  He has
47121	1	a	got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is
47122	1	a	symmetric.
47123	1	a	Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities
47124	1	a	equally.
47125	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave
47126	1	a	progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.
47127	1	a	Chest x-ray
47128	1	a	shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural
47129	1	a	effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild
47130	1	a	pulmonary edema.
47131	1	a	Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with
47132	1	a	creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.
47133	1	a	BNP is still pending.
47134	1	a	INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on
47135	1	a	Coumadin.
47136	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency
47137	1	a	Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2
47138	1	a	liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic
47139	1	a	improvement in his dyspnea.
47140	1	a	He has no further episodes of chest
47141	1	a	pain or pressure.
47142	1	a	I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,
47143	1	a	the SAH cardiologist on-call.
47144	1	a	I believe this patient has CHF
47145	1	a	exacerbation.
47146	1	a	He also was recently cardioverted, which ____
47147	1	a	explain his troponin elevation.
47148	1	a	Additionally, his CHF
47149	1	a	exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I
47150	1	a	doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
47151	1	a	At this point,
47152	1	a	the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on
47153	1	a	We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at
47154	1	a	this time.
47155	1	a	However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will
47156	1	a	be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for
47157	1	a	further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart
47158	1	a	failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.
47159	1	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin
47160	3	a	elevation, and diabetes.
47161	1	a	DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

47229	1	a	Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).
47230	1	a	Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.
47231	1	a	3.
47232	1	a	Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.
47233	1	a	This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

47536	1	a	Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
47537	1	a	Normal flow in both subclavian arteries.
47538	1	a	PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATIONS:
47539	1	a	Per the patient and his sons he was evalueated &gt;10 yrs ago w/ a colonoscopy which noted a single small benign polyp.
47540	1	a	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:
47541	3	a	87M h/o CAD (3vd), PVD, DM, HTN moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated CBD and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.
47542	1	a	We will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ERCP.
47543	1	a	Given the location of the largest stone i.e.
47544	1	a	not impacted with very slight LFT derangement I am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g.
47545	1	a	pancreatic ca).
47546	1	a	I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.
47547	1	a	Recommendations:
47548	1	a	-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also
47549	1	a	-IVF
47550	1	a	-clear liquids ok until midnight
47551	1	a	-NPO from midnight
47552	1	a	-neurology consult for risk of GA given carotid artery disease burden
47553	1	a	-please confirm with vascular surg ERCP/GA safe given dissection/aortic ulcer present
47554	1	a	-patient waitlisted for ERCP w/ GA on 6/27/64

47579	1	a	RE:  Christine Olivier
47580	1	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
47581	1	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
47582	1	a	Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
47583	1	a	regarding her current cardiac condition.
47584	1	a	As her history is well
47585	1	a	known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.
47586	1	a	Mrs.
47587	1	a	Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
47588	1	a	coronary artery disease.
47589	1	a	After several catheterizations in the
47590	1	a	2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
47591	1	a	(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
47592	1	a	showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
47593	1	a	was managed medically.
47594	1	a	However, she suffered a non-Q wave
47595	1	a	myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
47596	1	a	underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
47597	1	a	artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
47598	1	a	bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
47599	1	a	her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
47600	1	a	marginal branch.
47601	1	a	She underwent repeat catheterization in February
47602	1	a	of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
47603	1	a	but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
47604	1	a	She
47605	1	a	underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
47606	1	a	a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
47607	1	a	proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
47608	1	a	with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch

47610	1	a	The saphenous
47611	1	a	vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
47612	1	a	stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
47613	1	a	to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
47614	1	a	saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
47615	1	a	The left
47616	1	a	intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
47617	1	a	stenoses.

47619	1	a	posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%.
47620	1	a	She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
47621	1	a	in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft

47626	1	a	discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
47627	1	a	discomfort.
47628	1	a	Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
47629	1	a	exertional dyspnea.
47630	1	a	She has undergone extensive pulmonary
47631	1	a	evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
47632	1	a	have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
47633	1	a	1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
47634	1	a	with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.
47635	1	a	In
47636	3	a	addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
47637	1	a	hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.

47654	1	a	The neck is supple.
47655	1	a	JVP flat.
47656	1	a	Carotids are 2+ without
47657	1	a	significant bruits.
47658	1	a	Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
47659	1	a	rhonchi.
47660	1	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
47661	1	a	and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to

47676	1	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
47677	3	a	atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
47678	1	a	exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
47679	1	a	She denies any active chest
47680	1	a	discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
47681	1	a	alleviating the chest pain syndrome.
47682	1	a	The records available to me
47683	1	a	indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
47684	1	a	blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
47685	1	a	exacerbation of her angina.
47686	1	a	However, now that she is status post
47687	1	a	her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
47688	1	a	reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
47689	1	a	50 mg po q.d.
47690	1	a	She will have her blood pressure checked within the
47691	1	a	next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will

47693	1	a	also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
47694	1	a	edema and in part because she may no longer need this.
47695	1	a	Otherwise,
47696	1	a	I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
47697	1	a	to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
47698	1	a	can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
47699	1	a	close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur.
47700	1	a	I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
47701	1	a	appropriate.

47713	1	a	Hematology Clinic Progress Note 
47714	1	a	Fellow: Inge Logan, MD
47715	1	a	Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD
47716	1	a	Date of visit:  March 27, 2062
47717	1	a	Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.
47718	1	a	Hematologic History:
47719	3	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.
47720	1	a	At the time, blood sugar was >500.
47721	1	a	Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.
47722	1	a	The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
47723	1	a	At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA.
47724	1	a	Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
47725	1	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
47726	1	a	He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.
47727	1	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
47728	1	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
47729	1	a	Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.
47730	1	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
47731	1	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
47732	1	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
47733	1	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
47734	1	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
47735	1	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
47736	1	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).
47737	1	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
47738	1	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
47739	1	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.
47740	1	a	His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
47741	1	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
47742	1	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
47743	1	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
47744	1	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
47745	1	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
47746	1	a	He was discharged from the hospital in September.
47747	1	a	Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.
47748	1	a	Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.
47749	1	a	His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%).
47750	1	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.
47751	1	a	His platelets were 502,000.
47752	1	a	An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.
47753	1	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.
47754	1	a	His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid.
47755	1	a	Interval History:
47756	1	a	Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.
47757	1	a	When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.
47758	1	a	A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.
47759	1	a	He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.
47760	1	a	In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.
47761	1	a	He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.
47762	1	a	He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.
47763	1	a	He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.
47764	1	a	He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.

47818	1	a	Assessment and Plan:
47819	1	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency, subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and several small embolic-appearing strokes.
47820	1	a	In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
47821	1	a	He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.
47822	1	a	It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
47823	1	a	We are following his CBC on hydrea.
47824	1	a	His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).
47825	1	a	He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.
47826	1	a	His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.
47827	1	a	We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.
47828	1	a	At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.
47829	1	a	We would advise continuing current hydrea.
47830	1	a	Continue current hydrea
47831	1	a	Monitor counts monthly
47832	1	a	Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine.
47833	1	a	Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts
47834	1	a	The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.
