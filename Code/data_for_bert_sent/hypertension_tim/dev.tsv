3	0	a	MRN: 78361343
4	0	a	DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04
5	0	a	Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness
6	0	a	HPI:   
7	0	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
8	0	a	Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note).
9	0	a	Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.
10	0	a	She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months.
11	0	a	Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly.
12	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
13	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
14	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
15	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
16	0	a	She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
17	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
18	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
19	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
20	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
21	0	a	Cultures were negative.
22	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
23	0	a	She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily.
24	0	a	In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
25	0	a	This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin.
26	0	a	Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.
27	0	a	Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance.
28	0	a	Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls.
29	0	a	Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down.
30	0	a	Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused.
31	0	a	She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom.
32	0	a	It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days.
33	0	a	Patient reports intermittent headaches.
34	0	a	On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities.

138	0	a	Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
139	0	a	There is bilateral exophthalmus.
140	0	a	CXR: today
141	0	a	Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia.
142	0	a	Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.
143	0	a	EKG: sinus tachy.
144	0	a	no ST changes or Q waves.
145	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
146	0	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
147	0	a	Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.
148	0	a	Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities.
149	0	a	Head CT unremarkable.
150	0	a	Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid.
151	0	a	She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP.
152	0	a	She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.
153	0	a	This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
154	0	a	CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.
155	0	a	-check her gait
156	0	a	-check ESR
157	0	a	-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
158	0	a	-MRI of the brain
159	0	a	-EEG
160	0	a	-further lab w/u pending LP results
161	0	a	-remove foley catheter

364	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.
365	0	a	This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
366	0	a	At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
367	0	a	Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
368	0	a	She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
369	0	a	I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
370	0	a	She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
371	0	a	She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
372	0	a	Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.
373	0	a	If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

1144	1	a	"	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath."
1145	0	a	He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis.
1146	0	a	He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication.
1147	0	a	His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper.
1148	0	a	He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.
1149	0	a	On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness.
1150	0	a	He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.
1151	0	a	This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted.
1152	0	a	The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths.
1153	0	a	He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day.
1154	0	a	This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath.
1155	0	a	He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

1269	0	a	His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure.
1270	0	a	He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema.
1271	0	a	However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.
1272	0	a	His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event.
1273	2	a	His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.

1445	0	a	NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
1446	0	a	MRN:       8514931
1447	0	a	The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up.
1448	0	a	She has been having
1449	0	a	symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
1450	0	a	clear history of her symptoms.
1451	0	a	At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
1452	0	a	fall over to her right side.
1453	0	a	There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
1454	0	a	symptoms.
1455	0	a	She has not actually had syncope.
1456	0	a	There is no positional component to her
1457	0	a	I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms.
1458	0	a	The
1459	0	a	MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
1460	0	a	ovale and bilateral pontine region.
1461	0	a	She had small chronic lacunar infarcts.
1462	0	a	She reports
1463	0	a	that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
1464	0	a	would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms.
1465	0	a	She had some left internal carotid
1466	0	a	mild 30% proximal stenosis.
1467	0	a	Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.
1468	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts.
1469	2	a	Most likely related to hypertension rather
1470	0	a	than embolic disease.
1471	0	a	Her blood pressure has been very well controlled.
1472	0	a	In fact, today
1473	0	a	on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60.
1474	0	a	She brought her medications with her and
1475	0	a	has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o.
1476	0	a	q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
1477	0	a	hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o.
1478	0	a	q.d.
1479	0	a	She had not taken her medications today and
1480	0	a	her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
1481	0	a	the left.
1482	0	a	Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
1483	0	a	Her lungs are clear without
1484	0	a	wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
1485	0	a	Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
1486	0	a	S1, S2.
1487	2	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension.
1488	0	a	Now with lower blood
1489	0	a	pressure and some lightheadedness.
1490	0	a	We will d/c her atenolol.
1491	0	a	I would like her to get a
1492	0	a	repeat blood pressure in one week.
1493	0	a	I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
1494	0	a	Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
1495	0	a	diabetes.
1496	0	a	She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

2305	0	a	We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1.
2306	0	a	Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD.
2307	0	a	Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions.
2308	1	a	Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2.
2309	0	a	new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol.
2310	0	a	She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control.
2311	0	a	She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls.
2312	0	a	She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3.
2313	0	a	Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77).
2314	0	a	However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia.
2315	0	a	Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan.
2316	0	a	This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability.
2317	0	a	Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult.
2318	0	a	We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412

2733	0	a	RE:  Otis Narvaez
2734	0	a	     MR #045-61-32-6
2735	0	a	Dear Uddin:
2736	0	a	Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
2737	0	a	undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.
2738	0	a	His previous visit with me occurred on
2739	0	a	February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.
2740	0	a	He
2741	0	a	"denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion."
2742	0	a	This was not
2743	0	a	associated with activity.
2744	0	a	He admits to being a very sedentary person.
2745	0	a	The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
2746	0	a	LV function, and CT coronary angiography.
2747	0	a	There were no significant findings on the clinical
2748	0	a	evaluation.
2749	0	a	The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion.
2750	0	a	The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
2751	0	a	limiting stenosis.
2752	0	a	There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
2753	0	a	was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging.
2754	0	a	There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.
2755	0	a	The
2756	0	a	narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.
2757	0	a	A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
2758	0	a	cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
2759	0	a	342 mg/dl.
2760	0	a	He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.
2761	0	a	He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
2762	0	a	insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.
2763	0	a	Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.
2764	0	a	denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.
2765	0	a	His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
2766	0	a	Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
2767	0	a	Otis Narvaez
2768	0	a	MR #045-61-32-6
2769	0	a	Page 2
2770	0	a	aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.
2771	0	a	He usually takes these once every other day.
2772	0	a	He is
2773	0	a	now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.
2774	0	a	He takes this at bedtime.
2775	0	a	Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.
2776	0	a	This causes him
2777	0	a	to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.
2778	3	a	He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.
2779	0	a	He also has chronic low
2780	0	a	back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.
2781	0	a	He also has
2782	0	a	degenerative joint disease in his knees.
2783	0	a	He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
2784	0	a	depression.
2785	0	a	He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.
2786	0	a	On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
2787	0	a	cell carcinoma.
2788	0	a	On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.
2789	0	a	His
2790	0	a	weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
2791	3	a	the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.
2792	0	a	Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
2793	0	a	reveals upper dentures in place.
2794	0	a	There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear.
2795	0	a	There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.
2796	0	a	On cardiac examination, the heart
2797	0	a	sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
2798	0	a	rubs, or gallops.
2799	0	a	The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
2800	0	a	distal right calf.
2801	0	a	There is no edema noted.
2802	0	a	I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
2803	0	a	catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.
2804	0	a	He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
2805	0	a	Kraft will perform the procedure.
2806	0	a	His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
2807	0	a	catheterization.
2808	0	a	After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
2809	0	a	comprehensive metabolic profile performed.
2810	0	a	He will return to see me in the office again in one
2811	0	a	month.
2812	0	a	Best personal regards.

3322	0	a	RE: Lloyd Gregg 
3323	0	a	    MR#65772757
3324	0	a	Dear Xzavior, 
3325	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow
3326	0	a	up of his emphysema.
3327	0	a	The patient reports that he continues to lead a very
3328	0	a	active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours
3329	0	a	a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.
3330	0	a	When he
3331	0	a	returns home from work he cooks dinner and this
3332	0	a	combined with his work schedule and picking up his
3333	0	a	daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited
3334	0	a	him from a regular exercise program.
3335	0	a	Needless to say,
3336	0	a	he has remained active.
3337	0	a	He is not limited in these
3338	0	a	activities by his respiratory function with the
3339	0	a	exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with
3340	0	a	heavy lifting.
3341	0	a	He uses albuterol during these
3342	0	a	instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day.
3343	0	a	His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350
3344	0	a	liters per minute.
3345	0	a	He knows that when his PEFR falls
3346	0	a	to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for
3347	0	a	advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1
3348	0	a	burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.
3349	0	a	His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220
3350	0	a	micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI
3351	0	a	2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec
3352	0	a	and the albuterol as mentioned above.
3353	0	a	RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 
3354	0	a	The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of
3355	0	a	fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,
3356	0	a	change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.
3357	0	a	He does
3358	0	a	continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to
3359	0	a	frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.
3360	0	a	There is
3361	0	a	no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.
3362	0	a	On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress.
3363	0	a	NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.
3364	0	a	TM's are clear with
3365	0	a	normal light reflexes bilaterally.
3366	0	a	His nasal mucosa is notable
3367	0	a	for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.
3368	0	a	No
3369	0	a	significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary
3370	0	a	chains.
3371	0	a	Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and
3372	0	a	prolongation of his expiratory phase.
3373	0	a	He has an occasional
3374	0	a	expiratory wheeze.
3375	0	a	There are no focal findings of consolidation
3376	0	a	and air movement is moderate.
3377	0	a	No significant JVD and he has a
3378	0	a	regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and
3379	0	a	there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.
3380	0	a	Abdomen is benign without HSM,
3381	0	a	focal tenderness or masses.
3382	0	a	His extremities are without
3383	0	a	clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
3384	0	a	His weight is 223 pounds.
3385	3	a	Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his
3386	0	a	respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation
3387	0	a	of 97 percent.
3388	0	a	My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction
3389	0	a	secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.
3390	0	a	I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active
3391	0	a	life.
3392	0	a	We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of
3393	0	a	prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact
3394	0	a	information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of
3395	0	a	a flare.
3396	0	a	I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.
3397	0	a	To
3398	0	a	try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of
3399	0	a	prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun
3400	0	a	Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to
3401	0	a	be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.
3402	0	a	We talked about
3403	0	a	vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the
3404	0	a	influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia
3405	0	a	vaccine.
3406	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care.
3407	0	a	He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time
3408	0	a	but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a
3409	0	a	flare of his COPD.

3572	0	a	been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
3573	0	a	150 all the way up to 450.
3574	0	a	We have made some adjustments recently in 
3575	0	a	her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
3576	0	a	Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
3577	0	a	been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
3578	0	a	medicines without problems.
3579	0	a	She does note that she is having some pain 
3580	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
3581	0	a	The 
3582	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
3583	0	a	wanes over time.
3584	0	a	The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
3585	0	a	this.
3586	0	a	The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
3587	0	a	fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
3588	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
3589	0	a	walks with a walker today.
3590	3	a	Blood pressure: 144/76.
3591	0	a	Pulse: 78 and 
3592	0	a	regular.
3593	0	a	Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
3594	0	a	Her heart 
3595	0	a	is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
3596	0	a	She has got a regular rate and 
3597	0	a	rhythm today.
3598	0	a	Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
3599	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
3600	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
3601	0	a	edema.
3602	0	a	Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
3603	0	a	into the sciatic notch on the left side.
3604	0	a	She has got otherwise joints 
3605	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
3606	0	a	There 
3607	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
3608	0	a	Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
3609	0	a	monitoring.
3610	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
3611	0	a	I will 
3612	0	a	not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
3613	0	a	I 
3614	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
3615	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
3616	0	a	remits on it's own.
3617	0	a	12 Weld St                             BIRD, TERRI
3618	0	a	PAGE 2
3619	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
3620	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
3621	0	a	She is 
3622	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
3623	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
3624	0	a	I have discussed this 
3625	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
3626	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
3627	0	a	I will talk 
3628	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
3629	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
3630	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
3631	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
3632	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
3633	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
3634	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

3933	0	a	On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.
3934	0	a	This was complicated by a postoperative MI.
3935	0	a	03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
3936	0	a	is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.
3937	0	a	Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.
3938	0	a	He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.
3939	0	a	We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

4049	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
4050	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
4051	0	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
4052	0	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
4053	2	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
4054	0	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
4055	0	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
4056	0	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
4057	0	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
4058	0	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
4059	0	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
4060	0	a	daily lifelong.
4061	0	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
4062	0	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
4063	0	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
4064	0	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
4065	0	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
4066	2	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
4067	0	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
4068	0	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
4069	0	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
4070	0	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
4071	0	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
4072	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
4073	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
4074	0	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
4075	0	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
4076	0	a	b.i.d.
4077	0	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
4078	3	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
4079	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
4080	0	a	There are no bruits.
4081	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
4082	0	a	He was not clubbed.
4083	0	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
4084	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
4085	0	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
4086	0	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
4087	0	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
4088	0	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
4089	0	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
4090	0	a	TSH was also normal.
4091	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
4092	0	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
4093	0	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
4094	0	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
4095	0	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
4096	0	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
4097	0	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
4098	0	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
4099	0	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
4100	0	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
4101	0	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
4102	0	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
4103	0	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
4104	0	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
4105	0	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
4106	0	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
4107	0	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
4108	0	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
4109	0	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
4110	0	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
4111	0	a	Yours sincerely,

4351	0	a	In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy.
4352	0	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:  
4353	0	a	1.
4354	0	a	Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms:  Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms.
4355	0	a	2.
4356	0	a	He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management.
4357	0	a	At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day.
4358	0	a	We will review his medications on next visit.
4359	0	a	We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.

4533	0	a	Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
4534	0	a	If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
4535	0	a	Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles.
4536	0	a	Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.
4537	0	a	Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

4712	0	a	     MR #380-18-32-2
4713	0	a	Dear Dr. Xanthos,
4714	0	a	We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
4715	0	a	the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.
4716	0	a	We will
4717	0	a	not repeat her history as you know it well.
4718	0	a	Over the past three
4719	0	a	months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
4720	0	a	occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
4721	0	a	and tingling of the fingers and toes.
4722	0	a	She has maintained a
4723	0	a	relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
4724	0	a	of breath.
4725	0	a	An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
4726	0	a	revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
4727	0	a	minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
4728	0	a	On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
4729	0	a	pounds.
4730	3	a	Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.
4731	0	a	The
4732	0	a	lungs are clear.
4733	0	a	There is no peripheral edema.
4734	0	a	Again, there marked
4735	0	a	cushingoid features.
4736	0	a	Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
4737	0	a	comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
4738	0	a	facial hair over the past several months.
4739	0	a	In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
4740	0	a	uremia.
4741	0	a	Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
4742	0	a	undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
4743	0	a	dialysis within the next several months.
4744	0	a	We have arranged to
4745	0	a	recheck her chemistries today.
4746	0	a	We would also recommend that she
4747	0	a	undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.
4748	0	a	Although renal
4749	0	a	failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
4750	0	a	androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
4751	0	a	Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

5028	0	a	Dear Dr. Feldman:
5029	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
5030	0	a	today in the Cardiology clinic.
5031	0	a	As you know, she is a
5032	2	a	very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
5033	0	a	dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
5034	0	a	disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
5035	0	a	echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
5036	0	a	She
5037	0	a	last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
5038	0	a	appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
5039	0	a	Oregon.
5040	0	a	Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
5041	0	a	been doing quite well.
5042	0	a	She states that she has episodes of
5043	0	a	palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
5044	0	a	minutes.
5045	0	a	She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
5046	0	a	no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
5047	0	a	She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.
5048	0	a	Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
5049	0	a	continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.
5050	0	a	states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
5051	0	a	Cessation Program.
5052	0	a	Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
5053	0	a	q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
5054	0	a	q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
5055	0	a	Protonix, and Allegra.
5056	0	a	On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress.
5057	0	a	Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
5058	0	a	beats per minute.
5059	0	a	Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
5060	0	a	edema.
5061	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
5062	0	a	JVP is 8 cm of water.
5063	0	a	Chest is clear to auscultation and
5064	0	a	percussion bilaterally.
5065	0	a	PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
5066	0	a	physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.
5067	0	a	Abdomen
5068	0	a	is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
5069	0	a	Pulse examination is
5070	0	a	normal.
5071	0	a	Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
5072	0	a	ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
5073	0	a	minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
5074	0	a	467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.
5075	0	a	There is a nonspecific Q-wave
5076	0	a	abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
5077	0	a	compared to prior.
5078	0	a	In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.
5079	0	a	Her palpitations and
5080	0	a	likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
5081	0	a	quite acceptable for her.
5082	0	a	Therefore, she wishes no consideration
5083	0	a	of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
5084	0	a	has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
5085	0	a	Regarding
5086	0	a	her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
5087	0	a	well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
5088	0	a	diabetes.
5089	0	a	However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
5090	0	a	LDL.
5091	0	a	Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
5092	0	a	to 40 mg q.h.s.
5093	0	a	I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
5094	0	a	Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
5095	0	a	cardiovascular issues.
5096	0	a	Thank you very much for referring this
5097	0	a	very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
5098	0	a	Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
5099	0	a	preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

5487	0	a	ESH #:033-98-74
5488	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.
5489	2	a	As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.
5490	0	a	We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.
5491	0	a	She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.
5492	0	a	She is walking each day.
5493	0	a	Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.
5494	0	a	She has no complaints of pain.
5495	0	a	She is eating well.
5496	0	a	She is sleeping well.
5497	0	a	Her incisions have healed nicely.
5498	0	a	Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.
5499	0	a	Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.
5500	0	a	I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.
5501	0	a	Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.
