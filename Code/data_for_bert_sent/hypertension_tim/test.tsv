1	Mr. Villegas is seen today.
2	I have not seen him since November.
3	About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
4	he was gaining weight.
5	He does feel that his shoulders are
6	definitely improved.
7	It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
8	I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
9	medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
10	and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.
11	He is concerned because of the
12	relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
13	right.
14	When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
15	is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.
16	This
17	only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.
18	He has
19	no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
20	cranial complaints.
21	On examination today, BP 120/80.
22	He has no bruits over the
23	carotid.
24	He has no tenderness in this region either.
25	He has good
26	peripheral pulses at the arms.
27	His joint examination is much
28	improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
29	synovitis.
30	Clinical Impression:
31	#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
32	Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.
33	He has stopped the
34	Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.
35	#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
36	disease.
37	Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.
38	Patient
39	advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.
40	been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
41	that he continue to do so.
42	He will follow-up with me shortly after
43	the ultrasound study.

173	Reason for Visit
174	Sternal pain.
175	History of Present Illness
176	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
177	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
178	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
179	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
180	No variation with food.
181	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
182	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
183	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
184	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).
185	ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail.
186	He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

228	No focal rhonchi.
229	No pleural rub.
230	+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth.

242	Lab Test
243	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
244	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
245	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
246	Impression
247	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
248	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
249	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
250	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
251	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
252	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
253	Plan
254	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
255	- check CXR
256	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
257	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
258	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
259	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

308	This is a preliminary dictation.
309	PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
310	patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 
311	diabetes who presents with fever and chills.
312	He is four weeks 
313	status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 
314	infected and had to be revised.
315	He has been doing well, but now 
316	presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 
317	his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 
318	taking Advil for the fever).
319	He presents for evaluation.
320	He has 
321	had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 
322	for the past two months secondary to his graft infection.
323	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.
324	MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin.
325	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
326	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 
327	179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 
328	degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.
329	There are some 
330	crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.
331	The 
332	heart has a regular rate and rhythm.
333	The abdomen is soft and 
334	non-tender, with good bowel sounds.
335	There is a right groin mass, 
336	questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.
337	The extremities 
338	are well-perfused.
339	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 
340	normal.
341	The blood sugar is 180.
342	The white count is normal at 3.7.
343	The hematocrit is 29.
344	The PT/PTT are pending.
345	The urinalysis is 
346	negative so far, with microscopic pending.
347	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery.
348	The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 
349	patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending.
350	Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 
351	history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 
352	who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 
353	a fever.
354	Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.
355	A Surgery 
356	consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 
357	pending.
358	The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 
359	Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 
360	disposition.
361	The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending.
362	CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery.
363	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever.
364	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
365	admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 
366	condition.

446	"Re:	Clarence H. HESS"
447	"	BCH 643-65-59-5"
448	Dear Dr. Swanson:
449	I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.
450	He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.
451	He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.
452	Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.
453	He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.
454	He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.
455	His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.
456	Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.
457	He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
458	We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.
459	He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.
460	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
461	Please don't hesitate to call with questions.
462	Sincerely,
463	Brittany Witt, MD

471	HESS, CLARENCE
472	64365595
473	07/08/2060
474	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.
475	Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.
476	We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.
477	Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.
478	He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.
479	He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.
480	MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.
481	He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.
482	It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.
483	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.
484	His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.
485	His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.
486	His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.
487	His lung fields are clear.
488	He has no cardiac murmur.
489	There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.
490	His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.
491	In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.
492	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.
493	It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.
494	We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.
495	He will continue his efforts at weight loss.
496	He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

877	Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the
878	lab, the patient had his catheter changed.
879	He then began to no
880	longer drain urine.
881	Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

1026	"Personal Data and Overall Health	"
1027	75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.
1028	"History of Present Illness	"
1029	Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32.
1030	He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes.
1031	The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only.
1032	He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report).
1033	A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal.
1034	He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA.
1035	He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine.
1036	They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined.
1037	No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.
1038	He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup.
1039	His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal.
1040	He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability.
1041	"He did have ""flashing lights in both eyes"" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then."
1042	He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.
1043	"Past Medical History	"
1044	Hypertension.
1045	He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis.
1046	He has not had his cholesterol checked.

1092	DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.
1093	"Plan	"
1094	I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome.
1095	I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents.
1096	I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.
1097	In addition, he needs a work up.
1098	I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study.
1099	Additionally, we should check fasting lipids.
1100	He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds.
1101	He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

1107	"Reason for Visit	"
1108	Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up.
1109	I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time.
1110	He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension.
1111	He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued.
1112	He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology.
1113	He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia.
1114	His CNIS have no evidence for disease.
1115	He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.
1116	"Medications	  "

1123	EOM's full, no nystagmus.
1124	Face symmetric, full power x 4.
1125	No drift.
1126	Gait steady, narrow-based.
1127	"Plan	"
1128	I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management.
1129	We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule.
1130	The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver.
1131	I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

1136	Dictated on: 06/14/2138 by URIEL T. ZIRKLE, MD 
1137	ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
1138	DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.
1139	HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133.
1140	At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
1141	Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans.
1142	For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy.
1143	A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
1144	CT scan was repeated in December of 2137.
1145	This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules.
1146	Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules.
1147	Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer.
1148	His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.
1149	He has met with Drs.
1150	Eagle and Yzaguirre.
1151	Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well.
1152	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
1153	1.
1154	Hypertension.
1155	2.
1156	CVA with residual weakness on the right side.
1157	He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.
1158	3.
1159	High cholesterol.
1160	CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.
1161	DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.
1162	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history.
1163	He last smoked in 2132.
1164	He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.
1165	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.
1166	PHYSICAL EXAM:
1167	No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
1168	No gynecomastia
1169	Respiration comfortable
1170	Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane.
1171	No skeletal deformity or tenderness
1172	Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
1173	Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
1174	No hernias.
1175	RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across.
1176	He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm.
1177	Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.
1178	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.
1179	Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.
1180	For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.
1181	Consent obtained today.

1205	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
1206	            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.
1207	His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.
1208	Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.
1209	He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.
1210	He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.
1211	His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.
1212	An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).
1213	His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.
1214	Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.
1215	He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.
1216	On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.
1217	He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.
1218	He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

1272	PFO/ASD
1273	8/31/41 CXR

1279	: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia
1280	#) Hyperglycemia:
1281	 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS.
1282	Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ?
1283	underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).
1284	No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).
1285	Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.
1286	Current FSBG 330.
1287	Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.
1288	Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN
1289	#) A-fib:
1290	 New onset a-fib.
1291	Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).
1292	CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.
1293	Currently rate-controlled 80s.
1294	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.
1295	Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.
1296	On ASA.
1297	Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.
1298	#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease.
1299	Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.
1300	#) Edema
1301	: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc).
1302	Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.
1303	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc.
1304	w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.
1305	Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.
1306	#) Bullous pemphigoid
1307	: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks.
1308	Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.
1309	#) HTN
1310	: Currently well-controlled.
1311	Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily
1312	Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.
1313	Monitor and add additional agents as needed
1314	#) Chronic kidney disease: Cr slightly above baseline, but improving with hydration.
1315	Will monitor.
1316	No current indications for renal replacement therapy.
1317	#) 
1318	?
1319	PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).
1320	Will hold antibiotics.
1321	#) Gout: cont.
1322	allopurinol (redosed for renal function)

1901	54 y/o Spanish speaking male with HTN, HL presents to PNC after syncopal episode 2 days ago and was found to have AS at OSH.
1902	Mean gradient of 38mmHg indicates moderate disease.
1903	Prognosis after syncopal episode due to AS is 3 years.
1904	AS:  Monitor for syncope, CHF, ischemia
1905	Repeat Echo to assess valve area, gradients
1906	Afterload reduction--start on ACE
1907	Cont statin, check lipid panel
1908	Avoid nitrates, diuretics
1909	His symptomatic AS warrants w/u for AVR
1910	Ischemia: EKG changes c/w LVH although doesn   t quite LVH meet criteria.
1911	Did have + enzymes at OSH, although denies hx of chest pain.
1912	Positive biomarkers ?
1913	due to coronary insufficiency in the setting of AS.
1914	Cont ASA, lipitor
1915	Cycle enzymes
1916	Will likely need coronary angiography before AVR

2036	"	Reason for visit:"
2037	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up.
2038	Interval History:
2039	   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.
2040	He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.
2041	He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.
2042	At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.
2043	He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.
2044	He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.
2045	His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.
2046	Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.
2047	He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.
2048	He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.
2049	He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.
2050	A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.
2051	The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.
2052	On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.
2053	A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.
2054	Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.
2055	An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.
2056	HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.
2057	His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit.
2058	ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.
2059	He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim.
2060	He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.
2061	With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.
2062	His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA.
2063	He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder.
2064	He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.
2065	Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well.
2066	He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.
2067	He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.
2068	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope.
2069	He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss.
2070	He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.
2071	He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.
2072	The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.
2073	He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.

2141	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis.
2142	The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.
2143	At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF.
2144	HE has evidence of severe TR on exam.
2145	From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.
2146	His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.
2147	PLAN:
2148	1.
2149	PVE endocarditis.
2150	He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement.
2151	He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID.

2171	Hyperkalemia.
2172	Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.
2173	Ww will check follow up chem panel today.
2174	He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.
2175	Patient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up.

2581	(665) 578-7821                     03/06/2087
2582	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman, new patient who comes in to establish primary care and for followup of multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of foot drop, etc.
2583	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
2584	1.
2585	End-stage renal disease.
2586	Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.
2587	She resumed dialysis in 2072.
2588	She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.
2589	She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.
2590	She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.
2591	She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.
2592	Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.
2593	2.
2594	Hypertension.
2595	3.
2596	Peripheral vascular disease.
2597	She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.
2598	She apparently does not have claudication despite this.
2599	4.
2600	History of right foot-drop.
2601	She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.
2602	5.
2603	History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion.
2604	6.
2605	History of CMV colitis in 08/2081.
2606	7.
2607	Secondary hyperparathyroidism.
2608	She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.
2609	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.
2610	She is status post appendectomy.
2611	She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.
2612	MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.
2613	FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.
2614	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.
2615	She is a lifetime nonsmoker.
2616	She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.
2617	She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.
2618	She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.
2619	She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.
2620	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
2621	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.
2622	She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.
2623	She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.
2624	She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.
2625	She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.
2626	She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.
2627	She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.
2628	She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.
2629	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.
2630	Her blood pressure is 140/60.
2631	HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
2632	Extraocular movements are intact.
2633	Throat is clear.
2634	Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.
2635	Heart, regular rate and rhythm.
2636	Lungs, clear.
2637	Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.
2638	Extremities, no edema.
2639	Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.
2640	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
2641	End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.
2642	Hypertension, well controlled on medications.
2643	Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.
2644	Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.
2645	Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.
2646	Right foot-drop.
2647	We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.
2648	Left shoulder pain.
2649	It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.
2650	We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.
2651	Hemorrhoids.
2652	8.
2653	Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.
2654	9.
2655	Health maintenance.
2656	Mammogram was done in 06/2086.
2657	Pap smear was done in 04/2083.
2658	Colonoscopy was done in 08/2081.
2659	10.  ?
2660	Depression.
2661	She seemed a little sad.
2662	Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos.
2663	Will have her come back and discuss further.

3401	Dear Thomas:
3402	  Thank you very much for referring Mr.
3403	Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
3404	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
3405	Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
3406	The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
3407	After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.
3408	It has been progressive over the last several months.
3409	He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
3410	He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.
3411	He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.
3412	Past medical history:
3413	   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.
3414	Hypertension.
3415	Hypercholesterolemia.

3434	Allergies:
3435	No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.
3436	Family history:
3437	   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.
3438	There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.
3439	Social history:
3440	   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.
3441	He does not drink alcohol.
3442	He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
3443	Review of systems:
3444	   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
3445	He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
3446	He denies hematochezia.
3447	He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.
3448	He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.
3449	He denies dysuria or hematuria.
3450	He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
3451	Physical examination:
3452	-Pulse:   55 and regular
3453	-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
3454	-resp.
3455	rate:   12 and unlabored
3456	-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.
3457	Mucous membranes are moist.
3458	Trachea is midline
3459	-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.
3460	Carotids are 2+ without bruits.
3461	Have a normal upstroke.
3462	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
3463	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
3464	He does have low dullness in both bases
3465	-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
3466	He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
3467	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
3468	No organomegaly.
3469	No pulsatile masses
3470	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
3471	He has no pedal edema.
3472	He has no clubbing or cyanosis
3473	Procedures:
3474	Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
3475	His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
3476	Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
3477	He had no chest pain.
3478	Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
3479	The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
3480	EKG:
3481	    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
3482	Selected recent labs:
3483	 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.
3484	Assessment and plan:
3485	   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096.
3486	His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
3487	There are a number of factors involved here.
3488	He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
3489	I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.
3490	He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
3491	He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
3492	He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
3493	He also has low platelets.
3494	The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
3495	It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
3496	He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.
3497	Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
3498	He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
3499	My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
3500	He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
3501	I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.
3502	I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.
3503	Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
3504	Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

3528	RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson
3529	     MR#471-90-84-7
3530	Dear Dr. Geiger:
3531	Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a
3532	preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071.
3533	As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
3534	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
3535	She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and
3536	brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has
3537	increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
3538	she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September
3539	of this year.
3540	In terms of her cardiac history, she was well
3541	until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath
3542	and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart
3543	failure.
3544	At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which
3545	revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to
3546	shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a
3547	dilated left ventricle.
3548	In addition, she had an echo in June of
3549	2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral
3550	regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
3551	She has never been hospitalized since that time for her
3552	congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good
3553	result.
3554	She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or
3555	claudication.
3556	She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
3557	In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her
3558	recollection.
3559	She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house
3560	and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs.
3561	She is
3562	able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty
3563	from chest

3566	pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops
3567	secondary to fatigue.
3568	Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
3569	CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
3570	She has never had
3571	surgery.
3572	Her family history is significant for a mother who died
3573	of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
3574	Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for
3575	40 years and quit four years ago.
3576	She denies alcohol, intravenous
3577	drugs or cocaine use.
3578	She lives with her husband and briefly
3579	worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.
3580	She
3581	has no known drug allergies.
3582	Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril
3583	50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po
3584	QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily
3585	and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.
3586	On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in
3587	her left arm and 165/70 in her right.
3588	Her heart rate was 104 when
3589	I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today.
3590	Her JVP was 7
3591	centimeters.
3592	Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid
3593	bruits.
3594	Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
3595	Her
3596	heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with
3597	occasional ectopic beats.
3598	She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6
3599	systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without
3600	radiation.
3601	Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
3602	extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
3603	Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
3604	She has a
3605	diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin
3606	effects.
3607	She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old
3608	anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
3609	In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
3610	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
3611	with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,
3612	likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial
3613	infarction, although she has never undergone heart
3614	catheterization.
3615	She is currently undergoing evaluation for a
3616	thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
3617	MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071
3618	Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 
3619	given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
3620	since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with
3621	imaging.
3622	If this is similar to her previous study showing only
3623	fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she
3624	will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative
3625	myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is
3626	well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having
3627	Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection
3628	fraction.
3629	She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection
3630	As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation
3631	and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or
3632	rhythm.
3633	Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days
3634	prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after
3635	surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons
3636	as to how may days she should wait after surgery before
3637	restarting that medication.
3638	She will otherwise remain on her
3639	current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and
3640	primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.
3641	If her stress test
3642	is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for
3643	further evaluation.
3644	Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
3645	She was seen
3646	and examined with Dr. Voss.

3661	November 24, 2071
3662	This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 
3663	for management of papillary thyroid cancer.
3664	Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 
3665	when she felt a prominence in her neck.
3666	She did not experience any dysphagia 
3667	or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 
3668	examination.
3669	She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 
3670	hospital.
3671	The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 
3672	cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
3673	She was 
3674	subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 
3675	thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.
3676	The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 
3677	was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 
3678	reimplanted.
3679	According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 
3680	locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.
3681	The 
3682	pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 
3683	lymphovascular invasion.
3684	There was an additional focus of papillary 
3685	carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.
3686	Of 
3687	note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.
3688	The tumor 
3689	did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
3690	Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.
3691	She has been 
3692	maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.
3693	She says that she feels generally 
3694	well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.
3695	She denies any 
3696	changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.
3697	She does endorse a one pound 
3698	weight gain over the last two months.
3699	She denies any paresthesias or other 
3700	symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.
3701	She denies any history of thyroid 
3702	disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.
3703	She is now referred for 
3704	consideration of radioiodine ablation.
3705	Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.
3706	She has an 
3707	ejection fraction of 25%.
3708	She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 
3709	hypertension, and anxiety.
3710	No history of childhood irradiation.
3711	Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 
3712	mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 
3713	captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.
3714	Allergies:No known drug allergies.
3715	Social History:Remote history of tobacco.
3716	She quit 4 years ago.
3717	She 
3718	endorses rare alcohol use.
3719	She is married with four children.
3720	Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.
3721	Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.
3722	Weight 208.
3723	Pulse 
3724	88.
3725	In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 
3726	NAD.
3727	HEENT:  PERRLA.
3728	EOMI.
3729	No proptosis or lid lag.
3730	Neck: supple with a 
3731	large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.
3732	No 
3733	Page 2
3734	remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
3735	Lungs: clear to 
3736	auscultation bilaterally.
3737	Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 
3738	rhythm.
3739	Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.
3740	Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.
3741	Neurologic: reflexes are 
3742	slightly delayed.
3743	There is no tremor of outstretched hands.
3744	Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 
3745	prior to surgery.
3746	Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.
3747	Calcium prior to 
3748	surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 
3749	surgery were in the mid-8 range.
3750	Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 
3751	failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.
3752	Ms. 
3753	Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 
3754	older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 
3755	multifocal disease.
3756	Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.
3757	We suspect that 
3758	she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.
3759	I have recommended 
3760	131I treatment.
3761	Benefits and risks were discussed.
3762	In addition, I think she 
3763	would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.
3764	TSH and calcium were drawn today.
3765	We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

3858	speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.
3859	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a
3860	history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
3861	She presents with
3862	episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls.
3863	She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.
3864	She
3865	also had dark stools over the past few weeks.
3866	She denies any
3867	associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any
3868	syncope, any nausea or vomiting.
3869	She does have a bruise on her
3870	chin.
3871	She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.
3872	No
3873	hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.
3874	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial
3875	fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
3876	hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.
3877	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.
3878	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,
3879	otherwise negative.
3880	MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,
3881	and digoxin.
3882	ALLERGIES:  None.
3883	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory
3884	rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air.
3885	General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm
3886	ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left
3887	shoulder.
3888	Her pupils are reactive.
3889	Neck is supple.
3890	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.
3891	Cardiovascular:  Regular
3892	rate.
3893	Abdomen is soft.
3894	Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive
3895	melena per the resident.
3896	Skin is otherwise with bruises over the
3897	left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears
3898	healing.
3899	Extremities are with good range of motion.
3900	No focal
3901	tenderness.
3902	She is oriented x3.
3903	Mood and affect are normal.
3904	She is moving all extremities equally.
3905	LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal
3906	process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial
3907	abnormalities.
3908	Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit
3909	of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and
3910	platelets of 358.
3911	INR of 2.
3912	Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no
3913	blood.
3914	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents
3915	with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent
3916	falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process
3917	such as a subdural or stroke.
3918	This has been going on for several
3919	weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past
3920	several weeks and profound anemia for which she required
3921	transfusion in the Emergency Department.
3922	We did order a CT of
3923	the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both
3924	given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.
3925	This
3926	does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.
3927	She is quite
3928	anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.
3929	I suspect this is the
3930	etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and
3931	concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could
3932	represent coronary insufficiency.
3933	She does not have an elevated
3934	troponin at present.
3935	She will need to be further monitored.
3936	was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her
3937	profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.
3938	Clinically, feels better.
3939	I discussed with the patient's family
3940	because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____
3941	further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as
3942	physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical
3943	issues have been addressed.
3944	She will be admitted to the medical
3945	service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal
3946	bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in
3947	stable condition.

3960	"PCC#:		090-73-07"
3961	January 20, 2088
3962	Reason for visit:  Mr. Jarvis comes to follow up on his hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and elevated PSA.
3963	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.
3964	This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.
3965	He began the Captopril and HCTZ (?
3966	or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.
3967	At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.
3968	He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.
3969	His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.
3970	On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.
3971	He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this.
3972	He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.
3973	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.
3974	His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.
3975	His weight is 173 (stable).
3976	IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.
3977	Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.
3978	We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.
3979	He will return in four months for follow up.
3980	Orvell Oliver, M.D.
3981	Labs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.
3982	Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.
3983	If the latter, will change it.

3998	REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
3999	visit.
4000	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
4001	any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.
4002	He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.
4003	He and his wife are 
4004	planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
4005	long weekends in New Mexico.
4006	He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.
4007	The pains in his hips 
4008	and legs have not been bothering him.
4009	When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
4010	gets results that range between 170 and 120.
4011	He has not been specifically 
4012	exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
4013	and walk the intervening distance.
4014	He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
4015	per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.
4016	Otherwise, the review of systems is 
4017	unremarkable.
4018	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.
4019	Blood pressure in the 
4020	right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.
4021	Chest is clear to P&A.
4022	Heart 
4023	sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.
4024	Neck 
4025	veins are not distended.
4026	Abdomen is nontender.
4027	Extremities have good dorsalis 
4028	pedis pulses.
4029	Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.
4030	IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.
4031	He remains 
4032	moderately hyperglycemic.
4033	He has an appointment to be followed by the 
4034	urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
4035	specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
4036	considered only a risk factor).
4037	PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
4038	the results are available.
4039	He should return in 6 months.

4055	Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.
4056	I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).
4057	I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.
4058	If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.
4059	Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.
4060	I don't think this will interfere with your trip.
4061	Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.
4062	Best wishes,

4329	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
4330	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
4331	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
4332	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
4333	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
4334	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
4335	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
4336	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
4337	He never developed chest pain.
4338	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
4339	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
4340	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
4341	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
4342	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
4343	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
4344	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
4345	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
4346	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
4347	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
4348	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
4349	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
4350	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
4351	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.
4352	He denies any calf pain.

4460	Reason for visit:
4461	   77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S/P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S/P R total hip replacement.
4462	Interval History:
4463	   Mrs. Mitchell has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD.
4464	She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085.
4465	Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.
4466	She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis.
4467	Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.
4468	Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder.
4469	Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital.
4470	She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively.
4471	She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight.
4472	Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range.
4473	Since her last visit, she has done well at home.
4474	Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes.
4475	However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion.
4476	She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC.
4477	She feels more energetic after this.
4478	She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.
4479	She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry.
4480	This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

4739	For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.
4740	No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.
4741	Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.
4742	Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.
4743	Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.
4744	Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.
4745	1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.

4776	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.
4777	Chest pain.
4778	The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.
4779	He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.
4780	The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.
4781	He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.
4782	The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.
4783	He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.
4784	The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.
4785	It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.
4786	Left renal lesion.
4787	As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.
4788	The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.
4789	I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.
4790	Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4791	The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.
4792	Obstructive sleep apnea.
4793	The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.
4794	Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.
4795	Elevated blood pressure.
4796	The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.
4797	Gastroesophageal reflux.
4798	The patient feels well on Zantac.
4799	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.
4800	He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.
4801	He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.
4802	He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.
4803	He has no burning on urination.
4804	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.
4805	His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.
4806	Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.
4807	The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.
4808	The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.
4809	The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.
4810	Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.
4811	Abdomen is soft.
4812	No liver or spleen was felt.
4813	Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
4814	Neurologically, the patient was alert.
4815	The patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.
4816	The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.
4817	1.
4818	Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
4819	2.
4820	New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.
4821	3.
4822	Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.
4823	4.

4825	5.
4826	Abnormal LFTs by history.
4827	6.
4828	Diabetes mellitus.
4829	7.
4830	Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.

5128	Dear Dr. Barron:
5129	Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
5130	I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
5131	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
5132	Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
5133	It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
5134	On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
5135	She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
5136	I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
5137	Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
5138	Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
5139	Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.
5140	She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
5141	Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
5142	She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
5143	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.
5144	Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.
5145	She has no known drug allergies.
5146	Social History:  She is married and has three children.
5147	She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
5148	Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
5149	She has never used tobacco.
5150	Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
5151	There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
5152	Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
5153	Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
5154	All others are negative.
5155	On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
5156	Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
5157	Her weight is 213 pounds.
5158	Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
5159	There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
5160	The carotid upstrokes are full.
5161	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
5162	The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
5163	The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
5164	The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.
5165	Her extremities show no edema.
5166	Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
5167	She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
5168	I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
5169	On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.
5170	She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
5171	She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
5172	There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
5173	She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
5174	In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
5175	She did receive drug-eluting stents.
5176	The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
5177	What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
5178	From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
5179	She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
5180	I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
5181	To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
5182	We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
5183	In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
5184	The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
5185	In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.
5186	Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
5187	After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
5188	However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
5189	She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.
5190	The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.
5191	This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
5192	I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
5193	Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
5194	If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

5266	NAME:     Upham, Zelda
5267	MRN:      9656797
5268	Patient is here for a follow-up.
5269	Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.
5270	Says
5271	that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people
5272	for transportation.
5273	Still has severe right shoulder pain.
5274	Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is
5275	worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.
5276	Reviewed x-rays, which were
5277	negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in
5278	the TMJ area.
5279	Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this
5280	shoulder pain.
5281	Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she
5282	could not take it with ibuprofen.
5283	I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in
5284	place of the ibuprofen and she understands.
5285	Is not willing to try Flexeril.
5286	Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult
5287	interactions with her children.
5288	Has not asked for more Valium.
5289	Has never been
5290	interested in counseling prior to today.
5291	Did not become tearful like she has in the
5292	past.
5293	Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.
5294	Prescription apparently was given to her
5295	last spring.
5296	Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.
5297	No clear to me what
5298	causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves
5299	her symptoms.
5300	I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain
5301	that is reproducible when she touches her chest.
5302	The patient seems to label her chest
5303	wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.
5304	PROBLEMS: As per LMR.
5305	MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.
5306	ALLERGIES: As per LMR.
5307	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD.

5309	Pulse 80 and regular.
5310	Weight 152 pounds.
5311	Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds.
5312	COR: RRR.
5313	S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.
5314	Extremities: No lower extremity
5315	edema.
5316	Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.
5317	Full range of motion of
5318	shoulders.
5319	No tenderness over AC joints.
5320	Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect
5321	of sternum and its border on left.
5322	No masses or deformity noted.
5323	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
5324	(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter
5325	     Mccarthy.
5326	Referral done.
5327	Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.
5328	(2)  Elevated blood pressure.
5329	Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated.
5330	At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.
5331	Think she may need
5332	     this at future visit.
5333	Will also refer back to her cardiologist.
5334	(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year.
5335	Several medications that patient appears
5336	     to be sensitive to side effects.
5337	At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting
5338	     profile.
5339	Positive checkup.
5340	Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.
5341	(4)  Leg cramps.
5342	Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25
5343	     years of leg cramps.
5344	Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction.
5345	Patient already takes Valium p.r.n.
5346	and I am reluctant to start any other
5347	     anxiolytics.
5348	Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit.
5349	(5)  History of sciatica.
5350	Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection
5351	     for her lower back pain, which resolved.
5352	Will simply follow with Vioxx, which
5353	     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.
5354	Also continue with
5355	     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and
5356	     chronic low back pain.
5357	Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks.
5358	ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell
5359	me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

5364	73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.
5365	She was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.
5366	At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx.
5367	Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit.
5368	The VNA has been seeing her at home.
5369	"According to the patient her BP has been ""normal""."
5370	She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA.
5371	They are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her PCP.
5372	She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.
5373	Appetite is good.
5374	She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.
5375	She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.

5501	A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.
5502	The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.
5503	She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms.
5504	I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.
5505	"P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of ""blockage"" means and about prognosis."
5506	I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).
5507	I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID.
5508	I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.
5509	Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.
5510	Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.
5511	Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead.
5512	She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8/27.
5513	Length of visit was 45 minutes.

5566	"SRI: 		134-43-51"
5567	Dear Dr. You:
5568	Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.
5569	Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.
5570	He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.
5571	He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.
5572	After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.
5573	He denies any history of trauma.
5574	He is a former smoker.
5575	He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.
5576	He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.
5577	Past surgical history is as above.
5578	Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.
5579	No known drug allergies.
5580	Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.
5581	All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.
5582	Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.
5583	He denies alcohol use.
5584	Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.
5585	On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.
5586	Respiratory rate is 12-14.
5587	Pulse is 60-70 and regular.
5588	Weight is 172 pounds.
5589	Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.
5590	No jugular venous distention.
5591	Normal respiratory effort.
5592	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
5593	Heart, regular rate and rhythm.
5594	No murmur or bruit.
5595	He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.
5596	He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.
5597	Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.
5598	On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.
5599	He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.
5600	No varicosities.
5601	He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.
5602	The right great toe is blanched.
5603	He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.
5604	He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.
5605	He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.
5606	Assessment and Plan:  
5607	1.
5608	Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.
5609	We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.
5610	We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.
5611	If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.
5612	2.
5613	Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.
5614	3.
5615	Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.
5616	His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.
5617	We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.
5618	4.
5619	Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5620	The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.
5621	I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.
5622	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.
5623	If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.
5624	Sincerely,

5715	Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load.
5716	There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations.
5717	No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand.
5718	Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place.
5719	As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.
5720	Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR).
5721	Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation.
5722	Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues
5723	Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI.
5724	Follow markers.
5725	Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.
5726	Have request FMC records.
5727	Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath.
5728	Heparin, 
5729	Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP
5730	Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.

6128	RE:  Gerald, Marion 
6129	MRN: 48967301 
6130	DOV: 05/18/83
6131	Dear Dr. Olive,
6132	Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.
6133	She is 
6134	referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.
6135	The patient states she is 
6136	currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 
6137	developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.
6138	This continued to bother her 
6139	and she eventually was treated with steroids.
6140	I am not sure she had a 
6141	diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.
6142	She then was switched to ibuprofen which 
6143	did not work particularly well.
6144	Over this time, she would have intermittent 
6145	episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 
6146	her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.
6147	She was seen by 
6148	Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 
6149	"she had ""25 shots"" of steroids."
6150	She denies any hot or swollen joints.
6151	She 
6152	has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.
6153	Extensive ROS reveals 
6154	no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.
6155	has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 
6156	well.
6157	She has continued to be concerned about that.
6158	She has had fevers or 
6159	chills but no temperature elevation.
6160	She has intermittent abdominal pain but 
6161	has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.
6162	She has 
6163	morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.
6164	Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.
6165	Mother is 
6166	85.
6167	Two sons alive and well.
6168	Two siblings alive and well except for 
6169	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
6170	Past medical history is pertinent for above.
6171	She has had a partial 
6172	hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.
6173	Medications 
6174	include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 
6175	metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 
6176	q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.
6177	No smoking or drinking history.
6178	No allergies.
6179	No other medical problems.
6180	Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.
6181	She works as a 
6182	midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.
6183	Her husband is 
6184	a Broadcast Technician.
6185	They have traveled quite a bit because of this.

6193	all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 
6194	cervical and lumbar area.
6195	Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.
6196	No oral ulcerations.
6197	Good salivary pool.
6198	No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 
6199	or axillary adenopathy.
6200	Chest: clear to A&P.
6201	No carotid bruits.
6202	Vascular 
6203	exam: normal.
6204	Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.
6205	Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
6206	Extremities: without 
6207	edema.
6208	I suspect she has fibromyalgia.
6209	I do not really know the place of steroids 
6210	in this setting.
6211	I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 
6212	CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.
6213	I will see her back in four 
6214	to six weeks.
6215	She will get old records for me to review.
6216	We will talk about 
6217	what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 
6218	have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.
6219	I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.
6220	Sincerely yours,

6237	Dear Dr. Higgins,
6238	Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary
6239	care.
6240	I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.
6241	She
6242	comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.
6243	Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.
6244	She has
6245	been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what
6246	she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had
6247	planned.
6248	However, she has other medical problems which I will
6249	deal with until she sees you.
6250	At her last visit, there was a
6251	"question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not"
6252	given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.
6253	However,
6254	she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,
6255	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include
6256	metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20
6257	q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.
6258	Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces
6259	her pain.
6260	She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
6261	HEENT
6262	was otherwise unremarkable.
6263	I obtained blood studies which
6264	revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62
6265	and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8
6266	with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of
6267	14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.
6268	A1c
6269	pending.
6270	A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did
6271	not reveal proteinuria or sediment.
6272	HBsAG and HCV are pending as
6273	well.
6274	I will be in touch with her regarding these results.
6275	I was
6276	wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of
6277	these abnormalities outlined.
6278	Thanks for letting me participate
6279	in her care.
6280	Sincerely yours,

6293	(449) 515-0294
6294	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest
6295	pain.
6296	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient
6297	with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,
6298	hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous
6299	doctor, Yesenia Olive.
6300	The following issues addressed:
6301	1.
6302	Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any
6303	symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.
6304	Maintained on Glucophage
6305	1000 mg b.i.d.
6306	Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day
6307	is around 120.
6308	We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.
6309	Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.
6310	2.
6311	Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will
6312	be less than a 100.
6313	She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day
6314	and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256.
6315	We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.
6316	3.
6317	Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is
6318	acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.
6319	4.
6320	Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood
6321	pressure is currently acceptable.
6322	5.
6323	Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation
6324	rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in
6325	the past.
6326	No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a
6327	history of recent chest pain.
6328	6.
6329	Exercise-induced chest pain.
6330	The patient has noted over the
6331	past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest
6332	when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.
6333	This
6334	subsides when she stops and rests for a while.
6335	This has been
6336	reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her
6337	husband.
6338	Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had
6339	thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted
6340	heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.
6341	EKG showed 1 mm ST
6342	depression in leads II and V4 through 6.
6343	The thallium scan
6344	showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior
6345	walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending
6346	artery distribution.
6347	She does not recall having symptoms at that
6348	time.
6349	Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with
6350	chest discomfort.
6351	There are some radiation into both shoulders
6352	and neck.
6353	Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,
6354	diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.
6355	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,
6356	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro
6357	150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d.
6358	and Glucophage 500 mg two
6359	tabs b.i.d.
6360	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
6361	SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.
6362	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel
6363	habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.
6364	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.
6365	Temperature
6366	of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.
6367	Pupils are equal,
6368	round and reactive.
6369	Conjunctivae clear.
6370	Sclerae anicteric.
6371	Oropharynx benign.
6372	Neck is supple.
6373	No neck vein distention.
6374	Thyroid is not palpable.
6375	Chest is clear to percussion and
6376	auscultation.
6377	Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,
6378	thrill or gallop.
6379	Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds
6380	and no organomegaly.
6381	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or
6382	edema.
6383	Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
6384	No
6385	abnormal complex.
6386	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
6387	Diabetes.
6388	We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she
6389	has had an ophthalmologic follow up.
6390	Maintain Glucophage.
6391	Elevated cholesterol.
6392	Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.
6393	Chest pain.
6394	Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.
6395	I have
6396	contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an
6397	ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.
6398	I prescribed nitroglycerin
6399	1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes.
6400	x 3 for chest
6401	discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.
6402	Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add
6403	beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing
6404	heart block.
6405	Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current
6406	Levoxyl.
6407	The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and
6408	cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

6421	(449) 515-0294
6422	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.
6423	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
6424	1.
6425	The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in
6426	today having just had a stress test.
6427	Stress test showed that she
6428	was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds
6429	achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,
6430	stopped for fatigue.
6431	Immediately after exercise, she did have
6432	some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.
6433	There were no EKG changes.
6434	The patient reports that she has been
6435	walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise
6436	level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had
6437	precipitated the hospitalization initially.
6438	She is looking into
6439	cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.
6440	She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.
6441	She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a
6442	healthy lifestyle.
6443	She has returned to work.
6444	She has follow up
6445	scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.
6446	2.
6447	Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her
6448	Glucophage 2000 mg a day.
6449	She monitors blood sugars but only in
6450	the morning.
6451	Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.
6452	However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically
6453	sweating and abdominal discomfort.
6454	She has never actually
6455	checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to
6456	occur at work.
6457	She has not had any fainting or dizziness.
6458	3.
6459	Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.
6460	4.
6461	Hypertension.
6462	At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose
6463	because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and
6464	currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.
6465	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,
6466	atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,
6467	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,
6468	Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage
6469	500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.
6470	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
6471	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness
6472	of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
6473	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in
6474	good spirits.
6475	Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is
6476	70 and regular.
6477	Conjunctivae are clear.
6478	Sclerae are anicteric.
6479	Neck is supple.
6480	No neck vein distention.
6481	Chest is clear to
6482	percussion and auscultation.
6483	Heart: Regular rhythm.
6484	S1 and S2.
6485	No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.
6486	Extremities are without
6487	clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
6488	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
6489	Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty
6490	with stenting.
6491	Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.
6492	At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac
6493	rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.
6494	Diabetes, seems as though her control is 
6495	impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.
6496	We will
6497	discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.
6498	Elevated cholesterol.
6499	We will check on lipid status in four
6500	weeks' time.
6501	On current medications with target of LDL less than
6502	100.
6503	Blood pressure acceptable on current medical
6504	regimen.

6808	Record date: 2094-04-03
6809	NAME:    Yager, Becky 
6810	MRN:     0887181
6811	Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
6812	A lot has happened since she
6813	was seen.
6814	She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.
6815	She
6816	therefore has been having financial problems.
6817	She does not have enough money to
6818	buy her medications.
6819	She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
6820	She has not taken these medications for months.
6821	She states she has been taking her
6822	nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.
6823	When I called her from
6824	the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
6825	she fell.
6826	We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
6827	taken.
6828	She reports being off balance for about the past month.
6829	She has been feeling
6830	more unsteady on her feet.
6831	She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
6832	to falling.
6833	She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
6834	mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.
6835	On review of other systems, she
6836	reports a 20 lb.
6837	weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
6838	working and being at home and eating more than usual.
6839	She also notes that she has
6840	begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.
6841	She complains of excessive
6842	dry mouth.
6843	She reports being more thirsty than usual.
6844	PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.
6845	She is alert and
6846	oriented X 3.
6847	Speech fluent without aphasia.
6848	BP sitting 145/70.
6849	Pulse 80.
6850	Standing
6851	BP unchanged at 145/70.
6852	Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
6853	bilateral nystagmus.
6854	Otherwise intact.
6855	On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
6856	movements.
6857	No drift.
6858	Good power throughout.
6859	Fine finger movements intact.
6860	Vibratory loss to the ankles.
6861	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
6862	When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
6863	was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.
6864	IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
6865	medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed.
6866	Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.
6867	Her
6868	exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.
6869	Therefore I suspect toxic
6870	metabolic cause.
6871	As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
6872	screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.
6873	I will be
6874	in touch with the physicians after they see her.

7024	RADIOLOGY
7025	Chest CT:  4/11/96
7026	"	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to"
7027	"	suggest pulmonary embolism."
7028	There are several mediastinal lymph
7029	"	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size."
7030	However, in the
7031	"	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes"
7032	"	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis."
7033	These could be
7034	"	reactive or neoplastic."
7035	There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
7036	"	node."
7037	In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
7038	"	parenchymal nodule."
7039	This is best demonstrated on image 65.
7040	This
7041	"	could possibly represent a malignancy."
7042	Alternatively this could
7043	"	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node."
7044	This does not appear to
7045	"	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less"
7046	"	likely."
7047	Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
7048	"	right lung base."
7049	There is no pneumothorax.
7050	No significant
7051	"	pleural fluid is noted."
7052	There is no pericardial fluid.
7053	IMPRESSION:
7054	"	No pulmonary embolism or DVT."
7055	There are multiple mediastinal
7056	"	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe."
7057	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
7058	A follow-up chest CT may be further
7059	"	value."
7060	These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time
7061	"	of dictation."
7062	EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.
7063	A/P:
7064	Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.
7065	This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.
7066	I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.
7067	Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
7068	CV:
7069	--Rate:  well controlled without medication.
7070	--Rhythm:  normal sinus
7071	--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.
7072	--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.
7073	Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.
7074	Will obtain stress test in AM.
7075	PULM:  
7076	--plant PPD
7077	--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.
7078	--send ANCA
7079	--follow up CT for nodule
7080	--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing
7081	ENDO:
7082	--urine metanephrines for pheo
7083	--5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid
7084	--TSH
7085	--AB-CT for evolution of adenoma
7086	--holding metformin, will control with SSIR.
7087	Prophy
7088	--Nexium
7089	--holding on fragmin for now-low threshold to resume for DVT prophy given possible oncologic diagnosis.

7232	   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:
7233	64 y.o.
7234	male with known CAD.
7235	He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
7236	At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
7237	He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
7238	He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
7239	He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA.
7240	His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
7241	He was referred for surgery.
7242	He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.
7243	He now presents with recurrent chest burning.
7244	He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG.
7245	His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest.
7246	He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis.
7247	During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test.
7248	Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds.
7249	He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved.
7250	MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility.
7251	There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct.
7252	His ejection fraction is 46%.
7253	He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.
7254	Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod.

7358	RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
7359	CDH#810 86 43 7
7360	Dear Dr. Shirley:
7361	Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.
7362	Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.
7363	Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
7364	underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
7365	hysterectomy in early October of 2078.
7366	Her post-operative course was 
7367	complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
7368	October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
7369	which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
7370	The episode was accompanied by 
7371	some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
7372	any palpitations.
7373	She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
7374	any symptomatic recurrences.
7375	Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
7376	she has been recovering well.
7377	She has no prior cardiac history.
7378	She 
7379	specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient 
7380	neurologic symptoms.
7381	She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
7382	mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.
7383	She feels that her exertional 
7384	capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
7385	stopped smoking.
7386	She does not have a known history of hypertension, however 
7387	VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
7388	systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
7389	with verapamil.
7390	There is no prior history of syncope.
7391	Page Two
7392	Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.
7393	has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.
7394	She previously smoked 
7395	two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
7396	any particular change in her health precipitating this.
7397	She rarely drinks 
7398	ethanol.
7399	She has not had any prior surgeries.
7400	Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.
7401	Review of 
7402	systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
7403	admission.
7404	Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
7405	comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.
7406	HEENT 
7407	is externally unremarkable.
7408	There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.
7409	Carotids 
7410	are palpable bilaterally.
7411	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
7412	Cardiac exam 
7413	reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
7414	impulse.
7415	There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
7416	Abdomen 
7417	is soft and nontender.
7418	There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
7419	abdomen.
7420	Extremities are without edema.
7421	Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
7422	palpable.
7423	The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
7424	of .18, QRS .08.
7425	There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
7426	and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.
7427	An 
7428	echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although 
7429	with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
7430	My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
7431	the perioperative period.
7432	She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
7433	not been previously treated.
7434	This would explain her electrocardiographic 
7435	changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
7436	atrial fibrillation.
7437	I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
7438	mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.
7439	Once her incision is further healed we will 
7440	arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
7441	regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
7442	mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.
7443	Page Three
7444	will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
7445	tolerance test.
7446	We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
7447	report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.
7448	We also gave her a 
7449	prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
7450	medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
7451	which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
7452	Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
7453	Sincerely,
7454	Paul N. Shelton, M.D.

7460	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
7461	Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.
7462	The Chief Complaint, History 
7463	of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
7464	Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
7465	by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
7466	the patient.
7467	Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
7468	with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
7469	essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.
7470	She 
7471	has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
7472	and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.
7473	Her 
7474	symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta.
7475	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
7476	noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
7477	systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
7478	border).
7479	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
7480	changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.
7481	These were 
7482	previously noted in 10/78.
7483	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
7484	and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
7485	morphine to relieve her pain.
7486	She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
7487	and was given some GI meds.
7488	She eventually became pain-free, 
7489	although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest.
7490	There are no electrocardiographic changes.
7491	IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
7492	pain suspicious for unstable angina.
7493	She has responded well to 
7494	aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
7495	evaluation.
7496	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.
7497	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission.
7498	Condition satisfactory.

7725	Victor Lujan
7726	SMH#:  018-92-33
7727	March 25, 2073
7728	DIAGNOSIS:
7729	Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.
7730	SUBJECTIVE:
7731	The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.
7732	The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.
7733	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
7734	Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.
7735	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
7736	Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.
7737	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
7738	Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.
7739	Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.
7740	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
7741	On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.
7742	Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.
7743	The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.
7744	There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.
7745	Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.
7746	However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.
7747	Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.
7748	IMPRESSION:
7749	As above.
7750	PLAN:
7751	My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.
7752	In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.
7753	It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

8184	EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18
8185	Impression: 
8186	55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity.
8187	His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits.
8188	The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy.
8189	He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.
8190	Recommendations: 
8191	-   check UA, NH3
8192	-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g.
8193	with Labetalol.
8194	-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.
8195	-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity
8196	-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy
8197	This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 
8198	Thank you for this interesting consult.

8396	"	Interval History:"
8397	   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham.
8398	Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.
8399	He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance.
8400	Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees.
8401	He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI.
8402	There was global hypokinesis.
8403	Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076).
8404	There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance.
8405	He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss.
8406	His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved.
8407	He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty.
8408	Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB.
8409	He still feels fatigued throughout the day.
8410	He has no orthopnea, PND, abdominal distension, early satiety, abdominal pain or anorexia.
8411	He reports BPs are much improved with the addition of Coreg, even as they are running 130-150s/80-100.

8605	RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594
8606	Dear Dr. Vanpelt,
8607	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 
8608	recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
8609	I followed him in the hospital 
8610	when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.
8611	As you know, he is a 77 
8612	year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 
8613	hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 
8614	lower extremity bypasses in the past.
8615	He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 
8616	for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.
8617	His preoperative evaluation 
8618	included 
8619	a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 
8620	induced 
8621	hypokinesis in the inferior wall.
8622	Since this was a small area, it was felt 
8623	he 
8624	could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.
8625	He 
8626	underwent 
8627	left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 
8628	with 
8629	no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
8630	However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
8631	35 and a troponin of 19.5.
8632	As a result of his large troponin leak, he 
8633	underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 
8634	main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 
8635	artery, 
8636	100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 
8637	posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 
8638	PDA.
8639	Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 
8640	45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.
8641	Due to 
8642	his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 
8643	on 
8644	Apr 20, 2091.
8645	He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 
8646	graft to his obtuse marginal artery.
8647	He did not have a graft to his 
8648	posterior 
8649	descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary 
8650	Nicholas-Xaviar, Fred
8651	MR #65856594
8652	Page Two
8653	to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.
8654	Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 
8655	April 
8656	27, 2091.
8657	His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 
8658	Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 
8659	morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
8660	and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.
8661	Since that time, he has done quite well.
8662	He has been progressing at 
8663	rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 
8664	per 
8665	day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 
8666	his house.
8667	He denies any chest pain with walking.
8668	He has no shortness of 
8669	breath or dyspnea on exertion.
8670	He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 
8671	long 
8672	time and this is unchanged.
8673	He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 
8674	claudication symptoms with walking at this time.
8675	He does complain of some 
8676	pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation.
8677	has 
8678	plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.
8679	On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 
8680	60.
8681	His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 
8682	without carotid bruits.
8683	His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 
8684	bilaterally.
8685	His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 
8686	rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.
8687	His 
8688	chest 
8689	incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well.
8690	has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 
8691	well.
8692	There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 
8693	does not appear to be cellulitic.
8694	His feet are warm.
8695	His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 
8696	in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 
8697	unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.
8698	In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 
8699	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 
8700	disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 
8701	three 
8702	weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.
8703	will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 
8704	time.
8705	I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 
8706	and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.
8707	I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 
8708	his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.
8709	I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 
8710	regimen so I have changed his 
8711	Page Three
8712	Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d.
8713	and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o.
8714	q.d..
8715	He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 
8716	develops 
8717	any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 
8718	concerns.
8719	He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.
8720	Thank you for 
8721	allowing me to participate in his care.
8722	Sincerely,

9124	Noticed black stools x 1 day, and blood suctioned form G-tube.
9125	Came to ED and while in ED waiting for a room had an episode of  near syncope.
9126	In ED 97.6, Pulse 82, BP 110/62 RR 20.
9127	In ED received 4 units FFP, 2 uPRBCs, and Zantac.
9128	GI saw him then and EGD showed large clot in fundus of stomach, but unable to find source of active bleeding.
9129	Duodenum was visualized up to the 3rd portion was normal.

9432	Dear Dr. Truong:
9433	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
9434	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
9435	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
9436	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
9437	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
9438	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
9439	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
9440	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
9441	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
9442	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
9443	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
9444	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
9445	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
9446	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
9447	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
9448	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
9449	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
9450	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
9451	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
9452	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.
9453	Sincerely,

9806	11/95 6 minutes 21 seconds standard Bruce, heart rate 112.

9808	No wall motion abnormalities.
9809	Dear Bethany: 
9810	I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.
9811	Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.
9812	Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.
9813	Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.
9814	She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.
9815	She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.
9816	After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.
9817	At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.
9818	When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.
9819	She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.
9820	She has not had palpitations.
9821	She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.
9822	She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits.
9823	She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.
9824	She has not had any peripheral numbness.
9825	The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.
9826	The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner.
9827	On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.
9828	The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.
9829	Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.
9830	She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.
9831	The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.
9832	She is fully alert.
9833	The neck veins are not elevated.
9834	The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.
9835	There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.
9836	The lungs are clear.
9837	The PMI is not displaced.
9838	There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.
9839	The abdomen is benign.
9840	There is no renal artery bruit.
9841	The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.
9842	There is no tenderness of her skin.
9843	The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening.
9844	Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.
9845	The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.
9846	However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.
9847	Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.
9848	I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.
9849	Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.
9850	I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.
9851	We are pleased with the present regimen.
9852	We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.
9853	We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.
9854	I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.
9855	Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.
9856	I know that you will continue to follow her closely.
9857	I told her that I would see her again in nine months.
9858	Sincerely,
9859	______________________________

10001	CXR: Clear.
10002	CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
10003	TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.
10004	A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.
10005	Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.
10006	It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.
10007	However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.
10008	Ischemic event is less likely in this man.
10009	EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.
10010	Other possible causes include:
10011	"  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently."
10012	However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.
10013	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.
10014	Plan:
10015	"1)	Continue hydration overnight."
10016	2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.
10017	3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.
10018	4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.
10019	5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.
10020	DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.
10021	Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.
10022	Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.
10023	"1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI."
10024	2)     Q6h finger stick check.
10025	3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.
10026	L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.
10027	Tender to palpation and with joint movement.
10028	No signs of infection.
10029	Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.
10030	"1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture."
10031	2)     PT consult.
10032	FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).
10033	Eating PO.
10034	On IVF for hydration.
10035	"1)	Replete Mg.  "
10036	2)     K now 3.6.
10037	If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.
10038	3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.
10039	Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin.
10040	Dispo: PT consult.
10041	Anticipate home discharge.

10050	Date of Admission: 10/10/92

10052	PCP: Estep, Willa
10053	Code status: Full
10054	CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis
10055	HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.
10056	He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.
10057	He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.
10058	He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.
10059	He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.
10060	He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.
10061	When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.
10062	One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.
10063	Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.
10064	As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.
10065	According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.
10066	He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.
10067	He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.
10068	Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.
10069	At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.
10070	In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.
10071	He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.
10072	He has had no other symptoms.
10073	Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.
10074	He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.
10075	Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.

10184	Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.
10185	Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.
10186	No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.
10187	No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.
10188	Stable Hct.
10189	Likely etiologies include:
10190	1.
10191	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.
10192	EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.
10193	Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.
10194	Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.
10195	2.
10196	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.
10197	Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.
10198	3.
10199	Prazosin-induced hypotension.
10200	In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.
10201	4.
10202	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.
10203	Plan:
10204	"Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers"
10205	"		- Telemetry"
10206	"		- 24 hr Holter monitor"
10207	"		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler"
10208	"		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m."
10209	"		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr"
10210	"		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient"
10211	"		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd"
10212	"DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m."
10213	"		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet"
10214	"OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN"
10215	"Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol"
10216	"Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc."

10229	CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope
10230	HPI:  
10231	83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am).
10232	Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning.
10233	He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode.
10234	When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic.
10235	He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.
10236	After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded.
10237	Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea.
10238	At no point did he have chest pain.
10239	He did not lose consciousness.
10240	This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092.
10241	In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis.
10242	However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain.
10243	The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc.
10244	He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath.
10245	He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat.
10246	He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts.
10247	ED Course:
10248	Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile.
10249	Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia.
10250	Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted.
10251	ROS: 
10252	Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI.

10257	Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).
10258	2.
10259	Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)

10409	ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     
10410	Chest xray: Clear
10411	Assessment & Plan
10412	83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting.
10413	Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features.
10414	However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain.
10415	Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s.
10416	However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion.
10417	It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.
10418	There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.
10419	Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
10420	Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
10421	Has completed MI r/o
10422	Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
10423	Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
10424	CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
10425	Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
10426	RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
10427	Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.
10428	Afebrile.
10429	Hemodynamically stable.
10430	U/A and chest xray negative
10431	Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
10432	Fen/Renal
10433	Replete Mg
10434	Proph: Lovenox, nexium

10570	PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
10571	History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
10572	seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.
10573	On the last visit he was having 
10574	chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
10575	evaluation.
10576	At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
10577	ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.
10578	The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
10579	the past with a decreased LV function.
10580	However repeat echo within the 
10581	past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
10582	of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
10583	Humbert Hospital against medical advice.
10584	After being evaluated in the 
10585	Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
10586	the Internal Medicine clinic.
10587	Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
10588	Carafate 1 gm.
10589	PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
10590	q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d.
10591	p.r.n.
10592	and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.
10593	His 
10594	insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m.
10595	and 18 units q.p.m.
10596	and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.
10597	On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
10598	pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
10599	discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
10600	Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
10601	of 76.
10602	He is not in any acute distress.
10603	His chest is clear to 
10604	auscultation.
10605	His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
10606	sounds.
10607	His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.
10608	rectal exam is guaiac negative.
10609	His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
10610	pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.
10611	Assessment and Plan:  
10612	1.
10613	Cardiac.
10614	The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
10615	     to rule out ischemia.
10616	2.
10617	Hypertension.
10618	His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
10619	3.
10620	Diabetes.
10621	His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
10622	     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
10623	4.
10624	The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
10625	     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
10626	5.
10627	General.
10628	The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
10629	     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

10636	History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
10637	me.
10638	I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
10639	disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
10640	The patient has had a positive 
10641	exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
10642	that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.
10643	However, patient was 
10644	overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
10645	approximately 50 lb.
10646	at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
10647	catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.
10648	Patient was seen last night 
10649	in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
10650	which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
10651	flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.
10652	On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.
10653	His exam was 
10654	notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.
10655	His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
10656	well.
10657	His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
10658	did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.
10659	An 
10660	abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
10661	presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.
10662	IVP 
10663	was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.
10664	He was given Toradol 
10665	in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
10666	Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.
10667	I was called by 
10668	the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
10669	flank.
10670	On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
10671	brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.
10672	On exam 
10673	he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
10674	pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
10675	abdomen.
10676	Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
10677	peritoneal signs.
10678	Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
10679	pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
10680	musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
10681	feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
10682	undergo this study this afternoon.
10683	I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
10684	with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
10685	rule out pancreatitis.
10686	Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
10687	ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
10688	reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.
10689	He is also 
10690	status post cholecystectomy.
10691	I will review his IVP later today and make 
10692	further therapeutic interventions at that time.

11180	New Milford Hospital 
11181	Department of Medicine 
11182	RE: Emery, Donn 
11183	NMH#: 059-57-26 
11184	Dear Dr. Pacheco:  
11185	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently.
11186	Thank you for your kind referral.
11187	I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.
11188	Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.
11189	His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.
11190	This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.
11191	Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left.
11192	At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.
11193	Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.
11194	He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet.
11195	He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.
11196	He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems.
11197	He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.
11198	Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.
11199	Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins.
11200	He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.
11201	He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50.
11202	His glucose control by his history has been very good.
11203	He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.
11204	Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.
11205	He has no known drug allergies.
11206	He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.
11207	His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.
11208	He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.
11209	He has several children, all in good health.
11210	On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.
11211	No carotid bruits could be appreciated.
11212	The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.
11213	He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.
11214	Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.
11215	Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.
11216	The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.
11217	Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.
11218	On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.
11219	There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.
11220	Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.
11221	In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.
11222	Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.
11223	Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.
11224	There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.
11225	Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.
11226	Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.
11227	Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.
11228	There was no jaw jerk.
11229	Toes were downgoing bilaterally.
11230	Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.
11231	Those results were available for me today.
11232	They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.
11233	Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.
11234	There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.
11235	Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.
11236	With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration.
11237	There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual.
11238	In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon.
11239	The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence.
11240	I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.
11241	Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.
11242	We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.
11243	However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him.
11244	Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem.
11245	I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.
11246	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.
11247	Once again, thank you for your kind referral.

11256	NMH#:  059-57-26
11257	December 29, 2096
11258	INTERVAL HISTORY:
11259	He has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis.
11260	He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. 
11261	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
11262	General:  Complaint of mild fatigue.
11263	No fevers, chills, or change in appetite.
11264	HEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness.
11265	Pulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing.
11266	Cardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations.
11267	Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.
11268	Urologic:  No dysuria, hematuria.
11269	Lymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
11270	Musculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain.
11271	Hematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting.
11272	Neurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right.
11273	He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.
11274	He has had some moderately severe back pain.
11275	REVIEW OF STUDIES:
11276	Blood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3.
11277	I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing.
11278	A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months.
11279	If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age.
11280	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
11281	Weight:  175 lb.
11282	with shoes.
11283	Blood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine.
11284	He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.
11285	Skin:  Normal.
11286	Lymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
11287	There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.
11288	Lungs:  Clear.
11289	Heart:  Normal.
11290	Abdomen:  No masses or tenderness.
11291	Extremities:  No evidence of DVT.
11292	No edema.
11293	Rectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities.
11294	IMPRESSION:  
11295	He is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone.
11296	His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall.
11297	I will see him next in six months.

11304	NAME:    Emmery, Donn S. 
11305	MRN:     0595726 
11306	Patient presents today for nail care.

11342	Present Illness:  
11343	Asked to see this 89 year old patient of Drs.
11344	Pina and Keefe, admitted with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis and less attention to diet at the time of his wife's death last week.

11377	Family History:  
11378	MGF had diabetes.
11379	Social History: 
11380	His wife died last week of Alzheimer's Disease, several months following a fall.
11381	He is a Financial Senior Manager.
11382	After the successful treatment of his lymphoma at about age 68, he went back to school to study sociology.

11401	R foot has small plantar arch, but L has no arch and bony prominence in the location of plantar arch; there is also some deformity of the  L ankle.
11402	"Neurological:	AJ absent."
11403	"Impressions and Plan:	"
11404	"  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes."
11405	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.
11406	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89.
11407	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him.
11408	Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect).
11409	Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper.
11410	I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice.
11411	Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind.
11412	Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.
11413	Thanks.
11414	Will follow.

11594	"	Interval History:"
11595	   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.
11596	The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.
11597	He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.
11598	The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
11599	Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.
11600	The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.
11601	Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).
11602	The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
11603	An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.
11604	The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.

11780	Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.
11781	Assessment and plan:
11782	   ASSESSMENT:
11783	63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).
11784	In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.
11785	The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.
11786	PLAN:
11787	Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).
11788	Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.
11789	No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.
11790	Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.
11791	Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.
11792	Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.
11793	Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.
11794	Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.
11795	Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.
11796	Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.
11797	Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.
11798	Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.
11799	Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

11831	Interval History:
11832	   Patient is a 63-year-old with long-standing right-greater-than-left claudication 
11833	The Fall of 77, he could only walk about 25 feet before experiencing 
11834	pain.
11835	Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24.
11836	An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses.
11837	He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left.
11838	10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI.
11839	A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%.
11840	He has been treated medically without any further angina.
11841	.
11842	11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal.
11843	The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent.
11844	6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal.
11845	The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA 
11846	Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief.
11847	In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain.
11848	He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise.
11849	A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds.
11850	"He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because "" his legs gave out""."
11851	Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK.
11852	Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped.
11853	He was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography.
11854	Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath).
11855	Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk.

12125	RE:  Lara, Uriah
12126	MRN: 62115644
12127	Dear Dr. Eastman:
12128	Thank you very much for referring Uriah Lara to the Georgia Regional.
12129	He's a 51 year old male who approximately 2 weeks ago developed 
12130	a pain and stiffness in his neck that limits his range of motion.
12131	Approximately 5 days ago he developed acute, severe and boring pain at 
12132	the right trapezius and medial scapular that limits his ability to sleep 
12133	and function.
12134	Toradol, anti-inflammatory muscle relaxants and Percocet 
12135	were of minimal help.
12136	He had no other constitutional symptoms; fevers, 
12137	rashes.
12138	He had noticed some numbness and tingling down the right 5th 
12139	finger and the pain would often travel down the outer part of the 
12140	triceps region to the elbow and down to the right 5th finger.
12141	He notes 
12142	certain positions will alleviate the pain.
12143	He then presented to a 
12144	chiropractor on Saturday who manipulated his back, obtained x-rays which 
12145	showed no abnormality.
12146	Sunday, he received another manipulation and on 
12147	Sunday night he was abdominal to sleep through the night.
12148	This morning 
12149	he states he had no pain in his neck, however, in mid-morning he did 
12150	have recurrent pain.
12151	He presents today for management treatment of his 
12152	disorder.
12153	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
12154	MEDICATIONS:  Flurazepam 20mg.
12155	at night.
12156	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for repair of a right 
12157	femoral compound fracture approximately 2 years ago and breast reduction 
12158	surgery.
12159	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary embolism after his 
12160	orthopedic surgery.
12161	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a pilot for Frontier Airlines.
12162	He is married and has 3 children who are healthy.
12163	He 
12164	smokes a pipe.
12165	FAMILY HISTORY:  He has one sister who has had a radiculopathy.
12166	Mother 
12167	is alive and well at 86.
12168	Father died of an MI.
12169	Page 2
12170	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure is 140/90.
12171	HEENT 
12172	examination was otherwise normal.
12173	Posture is somewhat stooped.
12174	Examination of the joints reveal deformity and swelling of the right 3rd 
12175	PIP.
12176	Has normal DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows and shoulders.
12177	Normal 
12178	hips, knees, ankles and toes.
12179	In the effected arm, he has normal elbow, 
12180	normal triceps and biceps reflexes.
12181	Normal brachioradialis reflexes.
12182	He has normal sensation in his hand.
12183	He has weakness of the right hand 
12184	intrinsic muscles and palpation in the medial muscle has felt an 
12185	improvement in the pain.
12186	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Lara, I believe, has an acute radiculopathy of the 
12187	a-cervical nerve.
12188	I informed him that this will get better and that it 
12189	was probably brought on by his antecedent muscle spasm.
12190	PLAN:  We prescribed a neck collar, Indocin 50 TID, Flexeril 10 TID and 
12191	I gave him additional Percocet.
12192	I also prescribed a course of physical 
12193	therapy with ultrasound and massage.
12194	He will call me in one week and return in roughly 2 weeks.
12195	Sincerely yours,

12326	Dear Kenneth: 
12327	Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention.
12328	He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.
12329	At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.
12330	He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.
12331	He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.
12332	MEDICATIONS:
12333	1.
12334	Aspirin 325 mg daily.
12335	2.
12336	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
12337	3.
12338	Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
12339	4.
12340	Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
12341	5.
12342	Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
12343	6.
12344	Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.
12345	INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:
12346	Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.
12347	Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.
12348	On examination, he is comfortable at rest.
12349	The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.
12350	The jugular venous pressure is 5.
12351	The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.
12352	The chest is clear.
12353	Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.
12354	The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.
12355	There is no peripheral pitting edema.
12356	The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.
12357	In summary, Mr. Lara has:
12358	History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.
12359	Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.
12360	Hypertension, not controlled.
12361	His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.
12362	We spoke about the options.
12363	As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.
12364	He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.
12365	To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.
12366	"A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly."
12367	Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.
12368	[Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms.
12369	Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines.
12370	He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.
12371	He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]
12372	Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.
12373	When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.
12374	A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.
12375	Mild mitral regurgitation.
12376	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.
12377	With kind regards, sincerely yours,

12633	      DOB: 08/02/2095
12634	Dear Dr. Calhoun;
12635	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
12636	As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck.
12637	We.
12638	started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
12639	In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
12640	We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
12641	He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.
12642	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
12643	1.
12644	Osteoporosis.
12645	2.
12646	Hypogonadism.

12663	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.
12664	MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day.
12665	ALLERGIES: Tape.
12666	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.
12667	Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds.
12668	Height 5 feet 4 inches.
12669	LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171.
12670	His hematocrit is 39.
12671	It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000.
12672	White count 4.8.
12673	In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer.
12674	The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
12675	I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
12676	He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.
12677	We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
12678	Please let me know if you have any questions.
12679	Yours sincerely,

12693	HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75
12694	REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.
12695	DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173
12696	REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).
12697	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.
12698	He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.
12699	This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.
12700	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.
12701	He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.
12702	While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.
12703	He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.
12704	In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.
12705	On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
12706	On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.
12707	On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.
12708	Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.
12709	On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.
12710	He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69.
12711	Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).
12712	INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
12713	He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
12714	He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
12715	He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat.
12716	Otherwise, he has been doing well.

12921	PCP: DR. ERNEST EDGE
12922	ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON
12923	OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)
12924	CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness
12925	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
12926	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
12927	He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).
12928	Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.
12929	He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).
12930	He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.
12931	He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.
12932	He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.
12933	To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.
12934	However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.
12935	On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.
12936	Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.
12937	EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).
12938	He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.
12939	For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.
12940	Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.
12941	(He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)
12942	CXR by report was clear.
12943	With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.
12944	Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.
12945	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
12946	Negative in detail except as noted otherwise above.
12947	PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:

13036	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
13037	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
13038	He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.
13039	He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.
13040	# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms
13041	- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion
13042	- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol
13043	- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs
13044	- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)
13045	- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures
13046	- Tele, replete lytes
13047	# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist
13048	- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids
13049	- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers
13050	- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 
13051	# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home.
13052	Relatively euvolemic.
13053	- Continue lasix QOD regimen
13054	- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy
13055	- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service
13056	# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house.

13308	- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
13309	- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
13310	- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
13311	- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
13312	- Neuro checks q4 hours
13313	- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
13314	- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
13315	- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
13316	- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
13317	- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
13318	- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.
13319	- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
13320	- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
13321	- Check blood cultures
13322	- Check chromogenic Factor X level
13323	- PT/OT evaluation
13324	- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130
13325	Thank you for this consult.

13341	Dear Dr. Berg:
13342	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.
13343	As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.
13344	He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
13345	He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.
13346	He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.
13347	He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
13348	The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
13349	The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.
13350	Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.
13351	He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
13352	He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
13353	His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.
13354	He is in atrial fibrillation.
13355	His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.
13356	His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
13357	His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.
13358	There is no hematoma or bruit.
13359	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
13360	His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.
13361	His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.
13362	His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.
13363	His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.
13364	We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o.
13365	daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
13366	daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.
13367	He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.
13368	He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
13369	daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
13370	daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o.
13371	b.i.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o.
13372	daily, Avandia 4 mg p.o.
13373	daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o.
13374	daily, NPH insulin 16 units each evening and sublingual nitroglycerin to be used as needed for chest pain.
13375	We have asked him to arrange a followup appointment with you within the next couple of weeks and to see Robert-Joseph Paige in the near future also.
13376	Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any issues regarding his ongoing management.
13377	With warmest regards.

13400	Dear Dr. Dill:
13401	DOB:  10/11/2082
13402	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
13403	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
13404	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
13405	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
13406	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
13407	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
13408	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
13409	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
13410	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
13411	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
13412	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
13413	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
13414	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
13415	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
13416	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
13417	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
13418	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
13419	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
13420	His weight has been stable.
13421	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
13422	His weight has remained stable.
13423	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
13424	Past Medical History:
13425	1.
13426	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
13427	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
13428	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
13429	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
13430	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
13431	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
13432	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
13433	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
13434	2.
13435	Hypertension.
13436	3.
13437	Dyslipidemia.
13438	4.
13439	Diabetes.
13440	5.
13441	Obstructive sleep apnea.
13442	6.
13443	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
13444	7.
13445	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
13446	8.?
13447	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
13448	9.
13449	Atrial fibrillation.
13450	10.
13451	Obesity.
13452	He has no known drug allergies.
13453	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
13454	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
13455	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
13456	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
13457	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
13458	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
13459	His father lived until the age of 88.
13460	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
13461	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
13462	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
13463	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
13464	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
13465	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
13466	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
13467	There is no wheezing.
13468	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
13469	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
13470	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
13471	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
13472	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
13473	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
13474	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
13475	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
13476	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
13477	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
13478	He appears to be functional class III.
13479	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
13480	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
13481	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
13482	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
13483	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
13484	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
13485	We will leave this decision to them.
13486	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
13487	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
13488	We will be in touch following the procedure.
13489	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
13490	Sincerely,

13508	He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.
13509	He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.
13510	He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.
13511	Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.
13512	Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.
13513	Moderate LV margin.
13514	Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).
13515	Dilated aortic loop.
13516	Normal RV size and function.
13517	Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.
13518	He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.
13519	He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
13520	"coronary artery disease	      "
13521	After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.
13522	Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.
13523	10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.
13524	Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.
13525	The L main had no significant lesions.
13526	The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.
13527	He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.
13528	He was discharged the following day without complications.
13529	Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.

13541	He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  
13542	"hypertension	      "
13543	BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.
13544	If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol
13545	"diabetes mellitus	      "
13546	He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
13547	He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.
13548	Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.
13549	"hypercholesterolemia	      "
13550	He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.
13551	We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.
13552	"nephropathy	      "
13553	S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
13554	As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.
13555	He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.
13556	[02-Jun-2087]
13557	Recheck BUN and creatinine today.
13558	"peripheral vascular disease	      "
13559	He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.
13560	"RECTAL FISTULA	      "
13561	SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE.
13562	SIG.
13563	HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA.
13564	HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.
13565	PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.
13566	CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.
13567	"OSTEOARTHRITIS	      "
13568	He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.
13569	"It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs."
13570	Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.
13571	Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.
13572	"Carotid stenosis	      "
13573	According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.
13574	Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.
13575	He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.
13576	"Review of Systems	"
13577	Small lesion on his R ear.
13578	Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.
13579	Nocturia X1.
13580	Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.
13581	No neurologic symptoms.
13582	Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.
13583	Denies peripheral edema.
13584	No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.
13585	He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.
13586	No melena.

13677	PROBLEMS:
13678	CAD.
13679	He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
13680	    current symptoms of angina.
13681	He is s/p CABG and most
13682	    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.
13683	CHF.
13684	He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic
13685	    CHF.
13686	His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe
13687	    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with
13688	    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate
13689	    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial
13690	    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. 
13691	    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and
13692	    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for
13693	    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms
13694	    of orthopnea, PND or edema.
13695	3.

13710	Hypertension.
13711	Blood pressure is excellent on current
13712	    regimen and will continue same.
13713	MR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089
13714	    6.
13715	Diabetes mellitus.
13716	He continues on oral agents, watching
13717	    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.
13718	He does not
13719	    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
13720	    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
13721	    of hypoglycemia.
13722	Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
13723	    albumin today.
13724	7.
13725	Cerebral vascular disease.
13726	He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
13727	    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
13728	    has had no new neurologic events.
13729	His most recent carotid
13730	    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
13731	    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
13732	    today.
13733	He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.
13734	8.
13735	Hypercholesterolemia.
13736	His most recent lipid profile is
13737	    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
13738	    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
13739	Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
13740	    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past.
13741	9.
13742	Peripheral vascular disease.
13743	He continues to have bilateral
13744	    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
13745	    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
13746	    of claudication.
13747	10.
13748	Osteoarthritis.
13749	He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
13750	    and is now doing quite well.
13751	Notably, he would require
13752	    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.
13753	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
13754	abdominal pain.
13755	He continues to have a rectal fistula.
13756	Last
13757	year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
13758	sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
13759	presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
13760	bleeds.
13761	He has had no recent edema in his legs.
13762	His left knee is
13763	doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
13764	muscles.
13765	He has nocturia one time per night.
13766	He has stable
13767	impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased
13768	ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial
13769	erection.
13770	Generalized decreased energy level.
13771	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular.
13772	Weight: 181.

13811	  Rickey George
13812	  MR#1131414
13813	  October 05, 2092
13814	  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.
13815	PROBLEMS:
13816	  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe.
13817	Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.
13818	Treated by Dr. Randall.
13819	Underwent extensive
13820	  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
13821	  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
13822	  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
13823	  knee popliteal bypass graft.
13824	With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
13825	  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
13826	He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
13827	  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
13828	  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.
13829	Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
13830	  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
13831	  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
13832	  hospital discharge 9/9.
13833	Will recheck renal function today.
13834	Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
13835	  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.
13836	His blood sugars are now in the normal
13837	  range on no oral agents or insulin.
13838	Will need to monitor closely through rehab.
13839	CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d.
13840	of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.
13841	At the time of
13842	  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d.
13843	and not surprisingly he developed quite
13844	  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.
13845	He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
13846	  up to 60 b.i.d.
13847	but he still has significant edema.
13848	Will go back to 80 b.i.d.
13849	with close
13850	  monitoring.
13851	Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.
13852	Will hold lisinopril
13853	  for now.
13854	Close VNA follow up.
13855	COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.
13856	Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.
13857	Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
13858	  and surgery with blood loss.
13859	His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
13860	  and he was being started on Epogen.
13861	Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
13862	  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a
13863	  Page 2
13864	  week.
13865	For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.
13866	Given his
13867	  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.
13868	Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
13869	  anginal symptoms.
13870	Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.
13871	Generally weak.
13872	Home services
13873	  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
13874	  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.
13875	Social history: wife very involved with his care.
13876	Physical exam: BP 98/60.
13877	Pulse 64.
13878	Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop.
13879	No rub.
13880	Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.
13881	Multiple well healed surgical scars.
13882	Extremities: incisions in the groin.
13883	No erythema.
13884	Right groin several cm question cystic
13885	  structure beneath the incision.
13886	Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.
13887	2-3+ edema in the
13888	  extremities bilaterally.
13889	Dry gangrene left second toe.
13890	Disposition: 1.
13891	Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d.
13892	phone follow up within several days.
13893	2.
13894	Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.
13895	3.
13896	Continue Percocet for toe pain.
13897	4.
13898	Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.
13899	5.
13900	Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.
13901	In the meantime, will
13902	  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.
13903	6.
13904	Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o.
13905	q.d.
13906	Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
13907	  about end of life issues.
13908	Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
13909	  other than his single toe at this point.
13910	"He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a"
13911	  BKA.
13912	He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
13913	  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

14053	"	Interval History:"
14054	   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
14055	Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
14056	Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
14057	Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
14058	The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
14059	A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
14060	There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
14061	A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
14062	Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
14063	RV function was normal.
14064	He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
14065	He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
14066	He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted.
14067	He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
14068	The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
14069	LV EF 63%.
14070	He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
14071	His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.
14072	A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
14073	The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
14074	LV EF 68%.
14075	He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
14076	He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
14077	He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.
14078	He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
14079	His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
14080	Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
14081	This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
14082	Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
14083	He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e.
14084	muscolskeletal in nature).
14085	He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
14086	He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
14087	He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
14088	No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
14089	He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
14090	He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
14091	He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
14092	Past medical history:
14093	   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
14094	Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
14095	2) Hypertension
14096	3) Hyperlipideimia
14097	4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI
14098	5) Ankylosing spondylitis

14120	   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.
14121	Assessment and plan:
14122	   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
14123	1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.
14124	Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
14125	Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
14126	He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
14127	His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
14128	The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
14129	He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
14130	His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
14131	However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
14132	I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
14133	2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.
14134	His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
14135	Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.
14136	He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
14137	flushing).
14138	He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
14139	After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.
14140	He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
14141	He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
14142	3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
14143	He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

14164	61 y/o M with h/o CAD admitted for CP.
14165	Cardiovascular history notable for:
14166	- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
14167	- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
14168	- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%
14169	He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.
14170	He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.
14171	He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.
14172	Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.
14173	No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.
14174	Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.
14175	Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.
14176	After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.
14177	Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.
14178	At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.
14179	Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.

14244	MRN #748-80-38-0
14245	May 05, 2069
14246	Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
14247	artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
14248	Since the surgery she has done
14249	quite well.
14250	She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
14251	4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
14252	and also education on dietary modification.
14253	During her hospital
14254	course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
14255	ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
14256	wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
14257	She was
14258	started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
14259	She
14260	also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
14261	Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
14262	She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
14263	renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
14264	Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
14265	diuretics.
14266	Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
14267	with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
14268	She is
14269	not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
14270	of breath.
14271	She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
14272	Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
14273	Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
14274	Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
14275	q.d.,
14276	lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o.

14286	q. day and
14287	CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
14288	Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
14289	pounds.
14290	Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
14291	150/100, pulse is 80.
14292	Her skin is without any rashes or
14293	ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.
14294	Heart regular rhythm,
14295	distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
14296	Her lungs are clear,
14297	there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
14298	healed.
14299	Her extremities are without any edema.
14300	Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
14301	Diagnosis:
14302	1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
14303	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica

14308	6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
14309	7)   Hypertension.
14310	8)   Morbid obesity.
14311	Plan:
14312	1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
14313	She is clinically
14314	     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
14315	     or angina.
14316	Her ejection fraction significantly improved
14317	     postoperatively.
14318	I am concerned about a relatively high blood
14319	     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
14320	     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
14321	I will
14322	     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
14323	     of her potassium.
14324	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
14325	Again we'll check regular labs
14326	     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
14327	Stable.
14328	Her blood pressure have been
14329	     under fairly good control.
14330	She has also lost a significant
14331	     amount of weight over 20 pounds.
14332	Her current weight is 326
14333	     pounds.
14334	We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
14335	We'll also recheck her blood count
14336	     and follow-up.
14337	The patient is using her CPAP
14338	     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
14339	6)   Hyperkalemia.
14340	She will continue with the Kayexalate as
14341	     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
14342	     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
14343	7)   Morbid obesity.
14344	She is making good progress with her weight
14345	     loss.
14346	She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
14347	     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
14348	     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
14349	     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica
14350	Page 3 
14351	She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

14959	RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
14960	SFC#:  553-15-48 
14961	Dear Dr. Kirk:  
14962	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.
14963	He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.
14964	The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
14965	An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
14966	The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.
14967	The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.
14968	Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
14969	There was no critical carotid stenosis.
14970	He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.
14971	He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
14972	His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.
14973	It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.
14974	He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
14975	He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.
14976	Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.
14977	He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
14978	He has no symptoms of aphasia.
14979	He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.
14980	I would agree with him.
14981	He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.
14982	Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.
14983	He has not had any problems with spasms.
14984	His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
14985	He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.
14986	He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.
14987	His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
14988	He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
14989	He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
14990	He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
14991	His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.
14992	b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o.
14993	q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o.
14994	q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o.
14995	q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o.
14996	b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.
14997	He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.
14998	He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
14999	I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.
15000	He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
15001	The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
15002	The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
15003	There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.
15004	On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
15005	His blood pressure was 150/90.
15006	His language was intact.
15007	His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.
15008	He was alert and oriented.
15009	His conversation was appropriate.
15010	The visual fields were full.
15011	The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.
15012	Facial sensation was normal.
15013	There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
15014	The tongue and palate were midline.
15015	The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
15016	There was atrophy of the left biceps.
15017	There was full range of motion of the joints.
15018	The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.
15019	The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
15020	His right side was 5/5.
15021	He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
15022	His right toe was downgoing.
15023	Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
15024	I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
15025	Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
15026	He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.
15027	Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.
15028	He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
15029	I hope that this will be the case.
15030	Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.
15031	I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
15032	His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
15033	I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.
15034	I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
15035	The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
15036	I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
15037	However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.
15038	He should continue on an aspirin a day.
15039	He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
15040	I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.
15041	We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
15042	This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
15043	After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.
15044	I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
15045	I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.
15046	The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.
15047	Sincerely,

15680	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
15681	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
15682	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
15683	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
15684	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
15685	-Telemetry
15686	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
15687	-If positive will start heparin gtt
15688	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
15689	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
15690	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix

15734	"Re:	Russell Urban	"
15735	"WRH#	4722064	"
15736	Dear Dr. Ussery:
15737	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
15738	As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.
15739	He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
15740	By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.
15741	He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.
15742	That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
15743	He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
15744	The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
15745	Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
15746	He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
15747	This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
15748	A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
15749	He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
15750	A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.
15751	This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
15752	His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
15753	Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
15754	He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
15755	Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
15756	He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
15757	He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.
15758	He has felt very well.
15759	He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
15760	His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
15761	Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
15762	He was evaluated and released.
15763	He never had any further testing.
15764	He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
15765	Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
15766	His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.
15767	He has no known drug allergies.
15768	Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
15769	He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
15770	He has been working in Borders.
15771	He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.
15772	He has no children.
15773	He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
15774	He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
15775	He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
15776	On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.
15777	His heart rate is 60 and regular.
15778	In general, he is in no apparent distress.
15779	His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
15780	His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
15781	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
15782	He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
15783	His abdomen is benign.
15784	His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
15785	On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
15786	His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
15787	His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
15788	The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
15789	His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
15790	His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.
15791	His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
15792	He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
15793	Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
15794	He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.
15795	His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
15796	His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
15797	There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
15798	His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
15799	In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
15800	Also, his systolic function has improved over time.
15801	I think there are two processes going on.
15802	One is coronary artery disease.
15803	Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
15804	The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
15805	Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
15806	He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.
15807	I suspect that this is myocarditis.
15808	Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
15809	It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
15810	From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.
15811	He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.
15812	For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
15813	His LDL goal will be less than 100.
15814	He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.
15815	His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
15816	I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
15817	I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
15818	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
15819	The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.

15833	"History of Present Illness	"
15834	     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93.
15835	He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward.
15836	Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.
15837	He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia.
15838	EF at that time was 51%.
15839	He has done reasonably well since then.
15840	In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion.
15841	He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95.
15842	EKG was positive for ischemia.
15843	Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia.
15844	His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.
15845	Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA.
15846	Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions.
15847	His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results.
15848	He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

16331	Nevada Hospital
16332	Internal Medicine 01 Dan Chan
16333	Angels City, NH 31731
16334	Dear Gray:
16335	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
16336	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
16337	I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
16338	I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
16339	The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
16340	At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
16341	He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
16342	He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal).
16343	An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
16344	An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
16345	Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
16346	Since then, he has had no further episodes.
16347	ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope.
16348	He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
16349	PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).
16350	Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening.
16351	This is an Equadorian formulation.
16352	SHx:
16353	He does not drink, nor smoke.
16354	FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
16355	Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
16356	On exam, he looks well.
16357	His heart rate is in the 64.
16358	His blood pressure was 115/70.
16359	His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
16360	His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
16361	His chest was clear to auscultation.
16362	His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
16363	His abdomen was soft.
16364	Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
16365	Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
16366	In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease.
16367	He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
16368	I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.
16369	With warm regards,  
16370	Sincerely yours,

16562	-responding to slow hydration, will aim for euvolemia and hold diuresis and ACE-I.
16563	Gentle IVF at this time given tenuous balance between being dry and volume overloaded, will reassess volume status in the AM along with AM lytes
16564	-hold lasix, ACE-I

16589	Pager # 32591
16590	Record date: 2129-05-10
16591	Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.
16592	Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.
16593	Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
16594	Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.
16595	When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
16596	Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
16597	Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
16598	Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
16599	Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.
16600	so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
16601	We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
16602	"He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
16603	OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.
16604	Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.
16605	DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.
16606	Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.
16607	UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.
16608	Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.
16609	Optho and podiatry current.
16610	Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.
16611	Coronary artery disease : s/p CABG 5/25, satable on ASA/Statin/ACEI/BB
16612	Hypertension 
16613	Vital Signs
16614	BP 118/70, Wt 235 lb
16615	well controlled.
16616	Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.
16617	Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.
16618	Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.
16619	Insomnia : since service.
16620	NTI helped a little in past, not after a while.
16621	CBT might help if successful.
16622	Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.
16623	Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.
16624	Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

16631	"			Reason for visit:"
16632	   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
16633	Interval History:
16634	   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
16635	A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
16636	An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
16637	The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion.
16638	HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA.
16639	1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
16640	His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.
16641	An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
16642	Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
16643	He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
16644	(BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2.
16645	An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
16646	Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters.
16647	He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
16648	In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief.
16649	He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
16650	An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
16651	He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done.
16652	It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.
16653	Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held.
16654	He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
16655	He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
16656	Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.
16657	(2 liters NP)
16658	Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent.
16659	Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

16825	FINAL DIAGNOSES: 
16826	1.
16827	Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 
16828	diabetes medicine this morning.
16829	2.
16830	PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.
16831	No 
16832	old electrocardiogram to compare.
16833	We need to address the PR 
16834	depressions.
16835	This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.
16836	I 
16837	would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis.
16838	3.
16839	Cardiac ischemia.
16840	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 
16841	need admission and a formal rule out.
16842	She may even need an 
16843	echocardiogram inpatient.
16844	A full work up is pending.
16845	patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 
16846	Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

16856	PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
16857	MRN:  8099832
16858	ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
16859	PCP:  unknown
16860	CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital
16861	HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.
16862	At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.
16863	As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.
16864	Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.
16865	Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.
16866	During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.
16867	At present, pt.
16868	c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.
16869	She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.
16870	Hospital Course: 
16871	MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt.
16872	was started on IV vancomycin.
16873	The bacteremic source remains unclear.
16874	TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.
16875	A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.
16876	Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.
16877	A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
16878	Back pain: Pt.
16879	c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.
16880	Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.
16881	An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.
16882	The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.
16883	No epidural extension was noted.
16884	There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.
16885	Pt.
16886	received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.
16887	As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.
16888	A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.
16889	A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.
16890	A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.
16891	Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.
16892	Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.
16893	A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.
16894	The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.
16895	An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.
16896	A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.
16897	Renal failure:  Pt.
16898	developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.
16899	Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.
16900	Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.
16901	Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.
16902	She was started on procrit by hematology.
16903	She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
16904	TIA:  Pt.
16905	has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.
16906	An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.
16907	This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.
16908	A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.
16909	No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.
16910	HTN: Pt.
16911	required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.

17013	ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.
17014	HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.
17015	Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.
17016	Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.
17017	Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.
17018	She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.
17019	In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.
17020	She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.
17021	She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.
17022	Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.
17023	She was transferred to GCH in August.
17024	She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.
17025	She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.
17026	She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.
17027	She was discharged to rehab in mid September.
17028	She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.
17029	She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.
17030	She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.
17031	She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.
17032	The arm swelling quickly resolved.
17033	There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.
17034	She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.

17056	2)  Hypertension.
17057	Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.
17058	3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.
17059	Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.
17060	With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.
17061	She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.
17062	INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.
17063	4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.

17073	TIA left hemisphere, ?
17074	repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.
17075	On Plavix and coumadin.
17076	Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.
17077	8)  History of elevated LFT's.
17078	May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.
17079	Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

17092	HPI: 
17093	Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.
17094	Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099.
17095	She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures.
17096	She was started on Depakote for this.
17097	Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures.
17098	EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.
17099	In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope.
17100	Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.

17285	EKG: Sinus at 86.
17286	Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.
17287	CXR 7/28: NAD
17288	Chest CT 4/03: 
17289	IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
17290	     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
17291	     apex.
17292	Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
17293	     tiny lung nodules seen.
17294	MRI 9/02
17295	     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
17296	     ischemia.
17297	There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
17298	     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
17299	     hole or craniotomy.
17300	There are chronic appearing, small right
17301	     cerebellar infarcts.
17302	There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
17303	     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
17304	     with small vessel ischemic change.
17305	There is FLAIR hyperintensity
17306	     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
17307	     parietal and left occipital lobes.
17308	No abnormal enhancement is
17309	     seen.
17310	The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
17311	     unremarkable.
17312	The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
17313	There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
17314	There is
17315	     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
17316	There are
17317	     bilateral lens implants.
17318	The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
17319	     otherwise unremarkable.
17320	MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
17321	     posterior cerbral artery.
17322	There is diffuse irregularity of the
17323	     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.
17324	There is moderate
17325	     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
17326	The
17327	     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.
17328	     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
17329	     the circle of Willis.
17330	Impression:
17331	     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
17332	     predominance as described.
17333	This could represent hemorrhage, high
17334	     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
17335	     injection.
17336	Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
17337	     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.
17338	Diffuse irregularity
17339	     of the left posterior cerebral artery.
17340	These findings could be
17341	     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
17342	     vasculitis is another possibility.

17352	BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.
17353	Echo    01
17354	Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
17355	    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.
17356	Left ventricular
17357	    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.
17358	There is no flattening of the
17359	    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
17360	    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
17361	    arterial pressure.
17362	There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
17363	    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
17364	There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
17365	    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
17366	There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
17367	    represent atherosclerotic change.
17368	The aortic valve is trileaflet.
17369	Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
17370	    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
17371	    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
17372	    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.
17373	There is no evident aortic stenosis
17374	    or aortic insufficiency.
17375	Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.
17376	Otherwise,
17377	    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.
17378	Normal appearing tricuspid
17379	    and pulmonary leaflets.
17380	There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
17381	    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
17382	Flow velocity could not be optimally
17383	    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
17384	    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
17385	There is no evident pericardial effusion.
17386	ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
17387	1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.
17388	History from family sounds much more like seizure.
17389	Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.
17390	Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.
17391	Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.

17410	Dear Dr. Mcfarland:
17411	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.
17412	As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture.
17413	Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies.
17414	She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.
17415	Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.
17416	She has had a negative cardiac stress test.
17417	PMH as above
17418	Meds: synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa

17437	PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal.
17438	There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator.
17439	The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit.
17440	Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated.
17441	Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.
17442	IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial.
17443	It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed.
17444	In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab.
17445	Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture.
17446	There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either.
17447	I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her.
17448	I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma.
17449	We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.
17450	Seen and d/w Dr. Weller

17739	Date of Consult:  7/26/78
17740	Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg
17741	HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.
17742	He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.
17743	He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot.
17744	There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78.
17745	He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well.
17746	The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.
17747	No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.
17748	During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.
17749	The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.
17750	The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.
17751	He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.
17752	Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

17812	Physical Examination:  
17813	General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
17814	Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.
17815	On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.
17816	It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.
17817	The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.
17818	The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.
17819	No odor.
17820	There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.
17821	Distal pulses palpable.
17822	Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.
17823	There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.
17824	The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.
17825	Relevant Laboratory Values:
17826	Pending
17827	Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.
17828	This may be amenable to local flap coverage.
17829	Recommendations: 
17830	-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
17831	-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
17832	-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
17833	-Continue daily dressing changes for now.
17834	The patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.

17841	Medical Record: 8913196
17842	Attending:  Snyder
17843	History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.
17844	Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.
17845	The wound was overlying the BPG.
17846	He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.
17847	He has been followed in clinic.
17848	Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.
17849	In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
17850	The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.
17851	He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.
17852	His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
17853	No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.

18658	She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation.
18659	Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done.
18660	No report of recent GI bleeding.
18661	In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s.
18662	Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%.
18663	Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given.
18664	Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.)
18665	Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection.
18666	CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis.
18667	After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus.
18668	Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7.
18669	Patient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions.
18670	Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.
18671	When daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care.
18672	She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics.

18876	RE:  Shilpa Pickett
18877	     MR #129-53-47-3
18878	Dear Philip:
18879	I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
18880	Clinic today.
18881	Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
18882	she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
18883	chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain.
18884	She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
18885	is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
18886	position.
18887	As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
18888	of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.
18889	Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
18890	po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.
18891	Of note, she was
18892	taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.
18893	Labetalol 200
18894	mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
18895	mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
18896	On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
18897	seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12.
18898	There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
18899	Carotids are free
18900	of bruits.
18901	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
18902	Cardiac
18903	exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.
18904	Abdomen
18905	is soft and nontender.
18906	The extremities are free of edema.
18907	Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
18908	block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
18909	In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
18910	factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
18911	increase in weight.
18912	We will be rechecking her lipid profile today.
18913	She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
18914	she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.
18915	She
18916	notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression.
18917	She has had no change in her hair or skin.
18918	For the 
18919	Pickett, Shilpa
18920	MR #129-53-47-3               -2-            October 13, 2061
18921	moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
18922	dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
18923	hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.
18924	It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
18925	Pickett' care.
18926	Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
18927	can be of help with.
18928	Sincerely,

18991	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
18992	numerous complaints.
18993	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
18994	since her upper respiratory tract infection.
18995	She had the flu in January 
18996	and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
18997	weeks ago.
18998	She states that this has severely debilitated her.
18999	She is 
19000	complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
19001	occasional dull headache.
19002	However, her main concern is her stomach and 
19003	her back.
19004	Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
19005	in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.
19006	This is different than her 
19007	reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
19008	Prilosec-Propulsid combination.
19009	She is describing some anorexia, although 
19010	she has not lost any weight.
19011	She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
19012	movements.
19013	She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.
19014	She wonders 
19015	whether this could be in gallbladder.
19016	In addition, she is continuing to 
19017	have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
19018	distribution.
19019	She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
19020	back.
19021	Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.
19022	She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.
19023	Her sugars 
19024	have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.
19025	Her blood 
19026	pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.
19027	She is saturating well.
19028	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.
19029	There was no JVD.
19030	Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ?
19031	S3 
19032	with no significant murmur.
19033	Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
19034	mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.
19035	Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.
19036	Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.
19037	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
19038	issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
19039	and cerebrovascular disease.
19040	She came in today for discussion of her 
19041	ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
19042	With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
19043	codeine, which has helped in the past.
19044	I gave her a prescription.
19045	I 
19046	warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.
19047	She should 
19048	contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
19049	steroid injection.
19050	With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
19051	postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
19052	disease.
19053	Unclear contribution from her reflux.
19054	Dr. Mario Robison 
19055	recommended elective cholecystectomy.
19056	Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
19057	being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to 
19058	page 2 
19059	consider her for the surgery.
19060	I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
19061	make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
19062	make an informed decision about the surgery.
19063	She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
19064	a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.
19065	She would probably do better 
19066	with lower blood pressure.
19067	We could consider increasing her Imdur.
19068	I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

19106	and rhythm.
19107	Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to
19108	palpation.
19109	No guarding or rebound on my exam.
19110	Extremities are
19111	warm and well perfused.
19112	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was
19113	established.
19114	Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,
19115	hematocrit of 39.
19116	BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is
19117	normal for the patient.
19118	LFTs are normal.
19119	Lipase is slightly
19120	elevated at 67.
19121	Troponin less than assay.
19122	Urinalysis 25-30
19123	white cells.
19124	The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,
19125	which is unchanged.
19126	KUB shows no air fluid levels.
19127	This patient
19128	has a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract
19129	infection.
19130	In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors
19131	and an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress
19132	testing.
19133	She will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with
19134	a possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV
19135	antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial
19136	exams for her probable pancreatitis.
19137	The patient was admitted to
19138	the floor in stable condition.

19152	REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.
19153	Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.
19154	She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
19155	She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.
19156	She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.
19157	She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
19158	There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.
19159	She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.
19160	She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
19161	There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
19162	The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.
19163	The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
19164	She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.
19165	She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
19166	Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.
19167	She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
19168	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
19169	and atenolol 50 mg q.d.
19170	She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
19171	Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
19172	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
19173	She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
19174	Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
19175	On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.
19176	Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.
19177	Head and neck were unremarkable.
19178	Chest is clear.
19179	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
19180	PMI is normal.
19181	S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.
19182	There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
19183	There is no S3.
19184	Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
19185	Bowel sounds are normal.
19186	Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
19187	Calf site is clean without bruits.
19188	Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
19189	Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
19190	Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.
19191	Liver function tests are normal.
19192	A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.
19193	Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
19194	She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.
19195	At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.
19196	We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.
19197	She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
19198	At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

19297	The patient was seen in conjunction with the resident, Dr.
19298	Vue.
19299	Resident's note was reviewed.
19300	The patient was seen and
19301	examined by me.
19302	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 73-year-old woman
19303	with extensive cardiac history of hypertension and coronary
19304	artery disease, IMI with any EF 40%, history of V-TACH, high
19305	cholesterol, insulin-dependent diabetes, and status post AICD
19306	cardiac catheterization and in the past.
19307	The patient was in the
19308	Emergency Department today visiting a family member.
19309	She was
19310	completely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which
19311	showed a pressure of 190/98.
19312	The patient states that she usually
19313	takes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the
19314	prescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has
19315	been taking only 4 of the 9.
19316	She is unable to say exactly which
19317	ones.
19318	She denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,
19319	shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
19320	Her husband is the one in the Emergency Department today and
19321	that is causing her some stress.
19322	Denies any rash, joint pain,
19323	back pain, polyuria, or polydipsia.
19324	Please see the resident's note for details of the patient's past
19325	medical history, surgical history, family history, review of
19326	systems, and physical exam.
19327	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in no distress with
19328	no complaints.
19329	Has a repeat blood pressure of 190/95 and
19330	saturating 99% on room air with a pulse of 70.
19331	Exam is
19332	remarkable for a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
19333	sternal border of 3/6.
19334	No JVD, with good and equal pulses.
19335	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
19336	She has no papilledema and fundal
19337	exam is clear.
19338	Neurologically, she is oriented x3 with normal
19339	mood and affect.
19340	IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG shows first-degree AV block with an old
19341	LAD.
19342	This is considered normal for this patient and is unchanged
19343	from before.
19344	Urinary dip is negative.
19345	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's usual pharmacy is
19346	contacted.
19347	Correct doses of her medications are obtained and
19348	refills for 2 weeks were given.
19349	She is told to follow up with
19350	her primary care physician within 2 weeks.
19351	She says she will be
19352	able to do that and remains asymptomatic throughout her Emergency
19353	Department stay.
19354	At one point during her stay, her blood
19355	pressure went up to as high as 209/98, however, on my last
19356	recheck, just prior to the patient leaving, the pressure was
19357	185/90.
19358	The patient's primary care physician was contacted about
19359	this and agrees to follow up with the patient within 3 days.
19360	DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home in satisfactory
19361	condition.

19766	   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.
19767	Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.
19768	First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.
19769	She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.
19770	She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.
19771	It gets better when she rests.
19772	She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.
19773	Her sugars are out of control.

19792	-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
19793	Procedures:
19794	Electrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.
19795	In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.

19797	Impression:
19798	   1.
19799	Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.
19800	Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.
19801	I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.
19802	I will continue on the current medication program.
19803	2.
19804	Hypertension.
19805	Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.
19806	Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.
19807	Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.
19808	3.
19809	Lipids will be checked.
19810	I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.

19820	RE:  Jennifer Vance
19821	     MR #542-66-00-3
19822	Dear Vester:
19823	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
19824	evaluation.
19825	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
19826	briefly for our records.
19827	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
19828	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
19829	significant coronary artery disease.
19830	In 2061, after a four to five
19831	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
19832	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
19833	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
19834	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
19835	inadequate results.
19836	She therefore was taken electively for
19837	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
19838	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
19839	She subsequently continued to
19840	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
19841	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
19842	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
19843	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
19844	The catheterization
19845	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
19846	artery graft.
19847	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
19848	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
19849	She recently has undergone an
19850	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
19851	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
19852	Trials
19853	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
19854	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
19855	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
19856	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
19857	She had no
19858	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
19859	Over the past two weeks
19860	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
19861	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
19862	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
19863	The pain is not
19864	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
19865	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
19866	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a

19957	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
19958	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
19959	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
19960	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
19961	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
19962	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
19963	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
19964	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
19965	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
19966	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
19967	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
19968	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
19969	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
19970	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.

20013	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
20014	Assessment and plan:
20015	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
20016	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
20017	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
20018	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
20019	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
20020	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
20021	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
20022	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
20023	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
20024	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
20025	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
20026	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
20027	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
20028	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
20029	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
20030	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

20169	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
20170	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
20171	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
20172	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
20173	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
20174	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
20175	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
20176	He returns today for review.
20177	He remains in reasonable health.
20178	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
20179	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
20180	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
20181	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
20182	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.

20557	      Assessment and plan:
20558	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
20559	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
20560	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
20561	Problems:
20562	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
20563	Takes it about once/month.
20564	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
20565	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
20566	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
20567	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
20568	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
20569	Continue her present dose of statin.
20570	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
20571	Continue her current regimen.

20595	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
20596	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
20597	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
20598	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
20599	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
20600	He presents now for cath and surgery.

20706	60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.
20707	It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.
20708	He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.
20709	He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.
20710	In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.
20711	Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.
20712	He was discharged without clear follow-up.
20713	The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.
20714	He has been ambulating on the wound.
20715	He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.
20716	He reports no pain.
20717	Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.

20927	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
20928	Assessment/Plan
20929	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
20930	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
20931	S/P Rt TMA.
20932	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
20933	By issue:
20934	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
20935	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
20936	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
20937	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
20938	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
20939	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
20940	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
20941	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
20942	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
20943	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
20944	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
20945	Might hold ranitidine as well.
20946	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
20947	Currently on olanzapine.
20948	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
20949	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
20950	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
20951	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
20952	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
20953	Would seek ID input to the end.
20954	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
20955	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
20956	Recs per nephrology
20957	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
20958	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
20959	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
20960	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
20961	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
20962	Thanks,

21174	Dear Dr. Huerta:
21175	Reason for visit:
21176	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
21177	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
21178	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
21179	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
21180	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
21181	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
21182	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
21183	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
21184	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
21185	The patient has been managed medically since then.
21186	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
21187	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
21188	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
21189	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
21190	His weight has been up and down.
21191	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
21192	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
21193	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
21194	Past medical history:
21195	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
21196	Current Medications:
21197	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
21198	 Glucophage 1 g BID
21199	 glyburide 10 mg BID
21200	 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM
21201	 Lopid 600 mg BID
21202	 allopurinol 300 mg QD
21203	 omeprazole 20 mg QD
21204	 aspirin 81 mg QD
21205	 Pravachol 80 mg QD
21206	 Avandia 8 mg QD
21207	Allergies:
21208	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
21209	Family history:
21210	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
21211	Social history:
21212	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
21213	Review of systems:
21214	   As above, otherwise negative.
21215	Physical examination:
21216	-Pulse:   60
21217	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
21218	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
21219	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
21220	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
21221	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
21222	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
21223	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
21224	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
21225	Selected recent labs:
21226	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
21227	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
21228	Assessment and plan:
21229	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
21230	He is doing well.
21231	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
21232	He is currently not anticoagulated.
21233	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
21234	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
21235	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
21236	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
21237	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
21238	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
21239	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
21240	Changes to Medications this visit
21241	lisinopril 20 mg   QD

21400	CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation.
21401	HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter.
21402	Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR.
21403	Pt did well post cardioversion.
21404	He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis.
21405	Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically.
21406	Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology.
21407	He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter.
21408	Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73.
21409	The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm.
21410	He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

21501	NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly
21502	MRN:      3299811 
21503	INITIAL VISIT 
21504	This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit.
21505	The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
21506	recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
21507	syndrome and back/chest pain.
21508	Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
21509	She was found to have a blood
21510	pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
21511	headaches.
21512	She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
21513	found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
21514	She was transferred to the
21515	Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic
21516	convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
21517	She also suffered a urinary tract
21518	infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.
21519	She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,
21520	at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
21521	On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of
21522	127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.
21523	She had a myxedematous face and
21524	was obese.
21525	She was cardiovascularly stable.
21526	Neurologically, she was able to move
21527	all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
21528	Cranial nerves
21529	intact.
21530	Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to
21531	elevated blood pressure.
21532	Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
21533	Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar
21534	puncture, both of which were negative.
21535	Electroencephalogram was  performed and
21536	showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
21537	The patient's
21538	alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
21539	She had
21540	an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral
21541	leads.
21542	Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
21543	The patient underwent a course of
21544	physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
21545	A
21546	specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
21547	this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
21548	use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
21549	threshold for seizure activity.
21550	Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.
21551	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,
21552	panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone

21627	"PCP:	Isaac Ng "
21628	"ID/CC:	Change in mental status"
21629	HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days.
21630	Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission.
21631	As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days.
21632	They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused.
21633	The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day.
21634	On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night.
21635	She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.
21636	The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.
21637	The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.
21638	She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.
21639	ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB.

21645	Hypertension - on Avapro, allergy to Ace-I
21646	Angina pectoris - negative stress 
21647	Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH.
21648	Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.
21649	Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis
21650	Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT
21651	Arthritis

21947	Time of Exam: 5:20 p.m.
21948	NICU day: 1
21949	Critically ill secondary to: 
21950	R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration
21951	Critical Care Min: 35 min
21952	History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness.
21953	BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived.
21954	Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.
21955	Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
21956	and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.
21957	She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.
21958	CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
21959	She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.
21960	At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.
21961	She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.
21962	PMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes

UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l
21993	Imaging/Studies/TCD: 
21994	Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.
21995	CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
21996	Assessment: 
21997	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
21998	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
21999	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.
22000	Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

22063	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  In brief, this is a 64-year-old 
22064	gentleman with morbid obesity.
22065	He is on CPAP.
22066	He has CHF, 
22067	hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, triple bypass, and 
22068	diabetes.
22069	He had three episodes of chest pain which woke him up 
22070	from CPAP last last night.
22071	Each episode reminded him of his 
22072	typical angina, but the last time he had it was in May.
22073	Those 
22074	three episodes were resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
22075	He 
22076	woke up today and thought he needed to be evaluated.
22077	He is also 
22078	complaining of low grade temperature.
22079	He has recently been 
22080	receiving VNA services as a result of a left foot ulcer as a result 
22081	of an oxygen tank burn.
22082	His VNA came to visit him today and found 
22083	that he had some crackles in his lungs with a temperature and was 
22084	concerned about a pneumonia.
22085	Please see the resident's note for 
22086	details.
22087	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain now.
22088	No shortness of 
22089	breath now.
22090	He states that his foot appears to be getting better.

22139	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
22140	gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
22141	post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
22142	1.
22143	He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.
22144	These are 
22145	improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
22146	128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
22147	ranging from 150 to 190.
22148	He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
22149	units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
22150	at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.
22151	He has not had any 
22152	further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
22153	seems to be sticking more to the diet.
22154	He has however gained some 
22155	weight, which is a little disconcerting.
22156	He does attend a podiatrist 
22157	and is doing well from that perspective.
22158	He is to return to the 
22159	ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.
22160	He 
22161	missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
22162	follow-up with nutrition at this time.
22163	2.
22164	Cardiovascular.
22165	He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
22166	atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.
22167	Further question regarding his stroke back 
22168	in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
22169	unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
22170	to have a hole in his heart at that time.
22171	He was eventually stopped off 
22172	Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
22173	put on Coumadin for life at that point.
22174	He had an aborted myocardial 
22175	infarction in 2067.
22176	He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
22177	exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
22178	yards before getting very short of breath.
22179	He has no orthopnea or PND.
22180	He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
22181	3.
22182	Health maintenance.
22183	We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
22184	flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.
22185	has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
22186	his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
22187	checked on the day prior to the test.
22188	This will be scheduled by our 
22189	secretary.
22190	He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
22191	standard dose and titrate up slowly.
22192	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
22193	Lipitor.
22194	Page 2
22195	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.
22196	He is tachycardic 
22197	at 98 beats per minute.
22198	Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
22199	sided cataract.
22200	Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.
22201	The 
22202	abdominal examination is also normal.
22203	His injection sites were clean 
22204	and without erythema.
22205	There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
22206	his feet appeared well.
22207	We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
22208	including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.
22209	PLAN:
22210	Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
22211	including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
22212	and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
22213	I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
22214	left the other doses as is.
22215	I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
22216	and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
22217	4.
22218	We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
22219	5.
22220	I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
22221	above for colorectal cancer screening.
22222	6.
22223	Return to see in a week's time, understands.
22224	He can discuss any 
22225	management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

22995	  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.
22996	History of present illness
22997	  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.
22998	Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.
22999	He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.
23000	At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.
23001	He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.
23002	He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.
23003	He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.
23004	He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.
23005	He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.
23006	He is here for a followup.
23007	Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.
23008	His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

23105	He was volume depleted at his last visit.
23106	Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.
23107	His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.
23108	His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.
23109	His weight control has been a problem.
23110	He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.
23111	He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

23305	Hyperlipidemia.
23306	Sleep apnea.
23307	2/1/11 stroke 4/4/12 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Small posterolateral scar and ischemia  2/21/14 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Moderate-severe anterior apical and inferior ischemia.

23309	Reactions to Medicines: None
23310	Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness
23311	History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.
23312	He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
23313	In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
23314	He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
23315	On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.
23316	He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.
23317	He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.
23318	ROS:Const.-Negative
23319	Eyes -Negative
23320	ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss
23321	CV: See above
23322	Respiratory: Sleep apnea
23323	GI -.
23324	Recent constipation  
23325	GU -Impotence.
23326	Urgency and incontinence  
23327	MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.
23328	Considering knee replacement
23329	Skin - Negative
23330	Neuro -CVA in past.
23331	Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.
23332	Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa
23333	Endocrine -  Diabetes
23334	Heme-No blood problems
23335	Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye
23336	Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
23337	He has no other major illnesses.
23338	He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.
23339	Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.
23340	Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
23341	Two sisters are living without diabetes.
23342	Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.
23343	He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.
23344	His significant other works as an optician.
23345	She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.
23346	Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
23347	BP 100 50/65.
23348	His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.
23349	He has no rales.
23350	He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.
23351	He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
23352	EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA
23353	Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
23354	He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
23355	In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
23356	I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
23357	I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
23358	Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
23359	I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
23360	Of course the catheterization will determine that.
23361	He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

23522	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female
23523	with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and
23524	atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of
23525	sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.
23526	She
23527	said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.
23528	She also
23529	said it felt like a burning.
23530	She had mild shortness of breath
23531	and left arm achiness.
23532	She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers
23533	or chills.
23534	She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no
23535	syncope.
23536	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,
23537	and atrial fibrillation.
23538	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.
23539	SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.
23540	FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.
23541	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.
23542	MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,
23543	aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.
23544	ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.
23545	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,
23546	respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters.
23547	The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,
23548	talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.
23549	ENT: 
23550	Atraumatic, normal to inspection.
23551	Eyes are normal.
23552	Neck: 
23553	Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.
23554	Respiratory:  Clear
23555	to auscultation bilaterally.
23556	Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
23557	rhythm.
23558	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
23559	GI:  Abdomen is soft and
23560	nontender.
23561	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
23562	Back is nontender.
23563	Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema.
23564	Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.
23565	Mood and affect is normal.
23566	Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.
23567	No motor or
23568	sensory deficits.
23569	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about
23570	150, unclear.
23571	It seemed that there was T waves in V3.
23572	There is
23573	no evidence of ST elevation MI.
23574	We thought this could be an SVT.
23575	It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.
23576	Our
23577	plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement.
23578	Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal
23579	sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was
23580	clear that there was T waves.
23581	At this point, we decided to give
23582	her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.
23583	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium
23584	3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,
23585	glucose 268.
23586	ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,
23587	total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,
23588	calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.
23589	White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit
23590	42.7, and platelets 438, 000.
23591	INR is 1.
23592	UA is negative for
23593	infection with trace blood present.
23594	PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient
23595	had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.
23596	If both of
23597	those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home
23598	from the ED Observation Unit.
23599	It is unclear the etiology of her
23600	arrhythmia.
23601	It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke
23602	spontaneously.
23603	The patient is to follow up with her primary
23604	doctor.
23605	DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.
23606	CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.
23607	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,
23608	reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,
23609	discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the
23610	patient.

23618	Record date: 2062-10-30
23619	54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.
23620	Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.
23621	He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.
23622	Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.
23623	He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.
23624	He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.
23625	So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.
23626	"After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions."
23627	Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.
23628	This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.
23629	He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.
23630	He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.
23631	He walks with a walker.
23632	He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.
23633	He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.
23634	He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.
23635	He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.
23636	He reports good glycemic control.
23637	He denies fevers/abd pain/nightsweats/chills/visual changes/HA/melena/cough/SOB.

23669	Skin: no rash
23670	EKG: QT 363, no acute changes
23671	Imp:
23672	54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.
23673	Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.
23674	Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.
23675	Plan:
23676	1) continue posaconazole
23677	2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection
23678	3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.
23679	Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.
23680	Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.
23681	He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.
23682	Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.
23683	On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.
23684	ECG without QTc prolongation.
23685	Abdomen is bening.
23686	Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

23696	The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse.
23697	Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill.
23698	The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment.
23699	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit.
23700	The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.
23701	Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand.
23702	He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight.
23703	He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.

23957	Chief Complaint: fistula clot
23958	History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.
23959	The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.
23960	"The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that ""the access had collapsed."""
23961	On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.
23962	At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.
23963	Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.
23964	Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.
23965	"ROS: No fever/chills, HA, SOB, CP, N/V/D (though states that stomach sometimes ""sensitive"")."

24091	"She states that she has been ""too busy."""
24092	Her only complaint 
24093	today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
24094	relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.
24095	Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.
24096	A noted in her 
24097	ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d.
24098	drug, however, 
24099	Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
24100	on an almost p.r.n.
24101	basis.
24102	Review of systems is essentially normal.
24103	Specifically, she denies any 
24104	headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.
24105	She also denies any 
24106	symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.
24107	She has no history of 
24108	dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
24109	Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.
24110	Vital signs are 
24111	significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.
24112	HEENT exam is unremarkable.
24113	Lungs are clear.
24114	Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
24115	S1, S2.
24116	No S3 is appreciated.
24117	There are no murmurs or rubs.
24118	Abdomen is 
24119	slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.
24120	No masses are 
24121	appreciated.
24122	Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
24123	suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.
24124	Indeed, exam of 
24125	her legs is entirely unremarkable.
24126	Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
24127	sediment and a urine creatinine.
24128	Assessment and Plan:
24129	1.
24130	Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
24131	     on her Procardia.
24132	I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
24133	     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
24134	     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.
24135	I will see her in a few days in order 
24136	     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
24137	     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
24138	2.
24139	Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
24140	     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
24141	     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)
24142	I  have asked her to continue taking 
24143	     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
24144	     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.
24145	Page 2                                        29195561
24146	3.
24147	Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
24148	     appointment.
24149	In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
24150	     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.
24151	She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
24152	     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.
24153	Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
24154	     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
24155	     function.
24156	4.
24157	Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
24158	"     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long."""
24159	She is to see me 
24160	     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.
24161	Her 
24162	     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
24163	     will not be repeated until next year.

24175	Mrs. Rutledge is a former patient of Dr. Xia's who comes in today to establish a new PCP and for follow-up of her hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2), and GERD.
24176	She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension.
24177	She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.
24178	Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.

24181	An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.
24182	She is currently well with no complaints.
24183	She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.
24184	She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.
24185	When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.
24186	She's not had this recently.
24187	She also does not check her BP at home.
24188	She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.
24189	She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.

24451	Dear Dr. Trujillo:
24452	Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady
24453	with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do
24454	revascularization of the right leg.
24455	Her history is well known to
24456	you but I will repeat it for our records.
24457	She has a long history
24458	of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30
24459	years, stopping 15 years ago.
24460	She has developed claudication,
24461	particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her
24462	husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved
24463	by rest.
24464	This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also
24465	in the right thigh as well.
24466	She had segmental leg pressures done
24467	which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an
24468	ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.
24469	An MR angiogram
24470	showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this
24471	as yet.
24472	She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes
24473	mellitus, which she has had for 10 years.
24474	Her other cardiac risk
24475	factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of
24476	myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her
24477	cholesterol level is.
24478	She has no history of hypertension,
24479	although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the
24480	past.
24481	She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for
24482	a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in
24483	swallowing tablets and keeping them down.
24484	She also has a past
24485	history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma
24486	that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive
24487	therapy.
24488	She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was
24489	uneventful.
24490	Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,
24491	palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,
24492	weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual
24493	disturbances, and all other systems are negative.
24494	She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin
24495	only.
24496	She has no allergies.
24497	On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any
24498	signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.
24499	Her heart rate was 85
24500	beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms.
24501	The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid
24502	upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.
24503	Her apex
24504	beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second
24505	heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.
24506	Her chest
24507	was clear to percussion and auscultation.
24508	She had no
24509	hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.
24510	She
24511	had the scars from previous operations present.
24512	Her femoral
24513	pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side
24514	without bruits.
24515	She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and
24516	posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on
24517	the right leg.
24518	There were no trophic changes in her legs.
24519	had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf
24520	level in a stocking distribution.
24521	Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.
24522	Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and
24523	requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any
24524	myocardial ischemia.
24525	I therefore think a stress test is
24526	required.
24527	She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and
24528	this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her
24529	atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.
24530	Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess
24531	for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.
24532	I have also
24533	asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing
24534	her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,
24535	which is elevated.
24536	I have also asked her to have a fasting blood
24537	lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is
24538	likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.
24539	I
24540	plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after
24541	her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.
24542	I will let you know the results of her stress test when they
24543	become available.
24544	Thank you for allowing me to take part in this
24545	lady's care.
24546	Yours sincerely,

24564	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.
24565	In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.
24566	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.
24567	She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.
24568	She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.
24569	Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.
24570	At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.
24571	She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.
24572	She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.
24573	She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.
24574	Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.
24575	An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.
24576	She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.
24577	The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.
24578	Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.
24579	Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.
24580	She denies dysuria.
24581	The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.
24582	At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.
24583	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.
24584	Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.
24585	Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
24586	Random fingerstick glucose is 202.
24587	Extraocular movements are full.
24588	The thyroid is not enlarged.
24589	The neck veins are flat.
24590	The chest is clear to auscultation.
24591	The breasts are free of masses.
24592	There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
24593	The heart sounds are regular.
24594	There are no rubs or gallops.
24595	There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.
24596	There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.
24597	No other masses are palpable.
24598	The lower extremities are free of edema.
24599	I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.
24600	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
24601	She has not been compliant with her medications.
24602	She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.
24603	She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.
24604	She continues to consume three or four beers a day.
24605	The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.
24606	Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.
24607	Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.
24608	I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.
24609	I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
24610	q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
24611	q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
24612	q.d.
24613	She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.
24614	I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.
24615	I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.
24616	She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.
24617	An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

24699	The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.
24700	She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.
24701	She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.
24702	She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.

24704	She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.
24705	She has had no facial weakness.
24706	She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.
24707	She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.
24708	Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.

24812	IMAGING:
24813	CT head without contrast 12/08/94:
24814	Prelim:  Mulitple regions of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, and in bilateral capsulothalamic regions as well as the left caudate/periventricular region.
24815	MRI/MRA head and neck:
24816	Not yet completed.
24817	Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:
24818	The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are
24819	"	intact."
24820	Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at
24821	"	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere."
24822	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.
24823	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.
24824	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not
24825	"	associated with significant stenosis."
24826	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum
24827	"	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the"
24828	"	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen."
24829	There is narrowing
24830	"	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of"
24831	"	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as"
24832	"	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence."
24833	Old CT brain 6/16/89:
24834	Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are
24835	"	not uncommon for a patient of this age."
24836	There are no regions of
24837	"	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction."
24838	Basal
24839	"	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar"
24840	"	infarction."
24841	No significant periventricular white matter changes are
24842	"	evident."
24843	_______________________________________________________________
24844	IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.
24845	She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).
24846	She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.
24847	Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.
24848	While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.
24849	She had persistent nausea and vomiting.
24850	Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.
24851	She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.
24852	Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.
24853	She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.
24854	She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.
24855	She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.
24856	While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.
24857	Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.
24858	RECOMMENDATIONS:
24859	1.
24860	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms
24861	2.
24862	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).
24863	3.
24864	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.
24865	Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.
24866	4.
24867	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen
24868	5.
24869	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s
24870	6.
24871	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).
24872	7.
24873	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.
24874	This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

25183	RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
25184	MR #863-35-65-5
25185	Dear Dr. Faust: 
25186	Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
25187	Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
25188	Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
25189	it now for our records.
25190	Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
25191	at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
25192	health until the past year.
25193	He denies any prior history of
25194	hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
25195	childhood illnesses or malignancy.
25196	He describes his usual baseline
25197	health as excellent.
25198	He is a religious walker, walking multiple
25199	times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast.
25200	Dr.
25201	Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
25202	was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia.
25203	This was treated with
25204	Metformin.
25205	Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
25206	apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
25207	he has been diagnosed with hypertension).
25208	He subsequently developed
25209	diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
25210	subsequently reduced in dose.
25211	In June of the past year the patient
25212	was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
25213	Hydrochlorothiazide.
25214	At that time he also was found to have lower
25215	extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
25216	The patient states in September of 2119 he
25217	traveled to trinidad and tobago.
25218	While in trinidad and tobago he had a
25219	marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
25220	found it difficult to ambulate.
25221	He denied any difficulty with chest
25222	pains or shortness of breath.
25223	He had no hemoptysis and no focal
25224	unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
25225	during the trip.
25226	He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
25227	ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
25228	significantly.
25229	However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
25230	medication and it was stopped.
25231	Subsequently his lower extremity has
25232	once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
25233	Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn.
25234	At the present
25235	time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath.
25236	He
25237	still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any 
25238	Page 2
25239	limitation.
25240	He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
25241	in his lower extremities.
25242	He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
25243	sputum production, no hemoptysis.
25244	He has no fevers or chills.
25245	believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
25246	months.
25247	He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation.
25248	denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
25249	that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
25250	often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him.
25251	denies any history of snoring.
25252	He has noted no new joint complaints
25253	although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
25254	his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm.
25255	This has been
25256	present for approximately two or three months.
25257	Other than that he
25258	believes his bowel and bladder function is normal.
25259	Review of
25260	systems is otherwise unremarkable.
25261	His past medical history is significant for:
25262	     1.
25263	Type II diabetes as above.
25264	2.
25265	An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his 
25266	        chart.
25267	3.
25268	Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide.
25269	4.
25270	Past history of right bundle branch block.
25271	He has no      
25272	        history of rheumatic fever.
25273	Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,
25274	Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,
25275	compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently.
25276	Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
25277	Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus.
25278	Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
25279	immigrant from trinidad and tobago.
25280	He has been living in Haleyville
25281	since the early 2059's.
25282	He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo.
25283	has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his
25284	bachelor's degree but none since then.
25285	He is a non tobacco user.
25286	uses alcohol minimally.
25287	He's never had any blood transfusions.
25288	lives with his wife.
25289	They have no pets.
25290	He does not enjoy any
25291	unusual hobbies not noted above.
25292	He has been exposed to
25293	tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD.
25294	On physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds.
25295	Blood
25296	pressure is 136/90.
25297	Pulse 83 and regular.
25298	Respiratory rate is 20.
25299	Temperature is 96.8.
25300	Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with
25301	ambulation in the hallway.
25302	This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
25303	increase in his heart rate to 100.
25304	HEENT exam is significant for a
25305	clear oropharynx.
25306	Sclera are white.
25307	Conjunctiva are minimally pale.
25308	Page 3
25309	The thyroid gland is normal.
25310	Jugular venous distention to
25311	approximately 10 cm.
25312	was noted.
25313	Neck was supple.
25314	Examination of the
25315	chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
25316	at both bases.
25317	There was no egophony and no wheezes.
25318	Otherwise the
25319	lungs were clear.
25320	Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
25321	normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated.
25322	No RV heave
25323	or lift was appreciated.
25324	No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
25325	The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced.
25326	No appreciable
25327	murmurs were detected.
25328	The point of maximum impulse was in the
25329	anterior axillary line.
25330	Examination of the abdomen revealed a
25331	nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
25332	below the right costal margin.
25333	This was nontender and smooth.
25334	Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well.
25335	Normal bowel
25336	sounds were present.
25337	Examination of the extremities reveal three
25338	plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
25339	extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
25340	extremities.
25341	No clubbing was noted.
25342	There were no skin changes
25343	consistent with collagen vascular disease.
25344	Multiple follicular
25345	lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
25346	well as on the left arm.
25347	Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.
25348	Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
25349	white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
25350	Differential was not remarkable.
25351	LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
25352	most recently 22.
25353	A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
25354	protein.
25355	No reportive cast was made.
25356	A CEA was notable for a level
25357	of 2.4 on 1/05/20.
25358	An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
25359	demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
25360	LV function.
25361	The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
25362	hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function.
25363	There was trace
25364	MR with moderate TR.
25365	A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
25366	right atrial pressure was noted.
25367	In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
25368	pulmonary hypertension.
25369	The etiology of this is not clear at the
25370	moment.
25371	Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
25372	disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
25373	sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease.
25374	In addition some
25375	patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
25376	setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
25377	ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
25378	exclusion.
25379	The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
25380	with increasing his diuretic regimen.
25381	I'm embarking on a course of
25382	evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.
25383	In specific he will
25384	be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
25385	disease this afternoon.
25386	This has already been arranged by Dr.
25387	Faust.
25388	In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
25389	antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70.
25390	I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
25391	Page 4
25392	to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.
25393	will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
25394	pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
25395	arterial blood gas drawn.
25396	If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
25397	he may require more invasive diagnostics.
25398	I've already consulted
25399	formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
25400	experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
25401	be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
25402	workup is nondiagnostic.
25403	Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
25404	I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
25405	his diagnostic tests have been performed.
25406	Please do not hesitate to
25407	call me with any further questions or concerns.
25408	Sincerely,

25724	Dear Hicks,
25725	I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
25726	She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.
25727	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
25728	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
25729	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
25730	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
25731	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
25732	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
25733	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
25734	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
25735	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
25736	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
25737	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
25738	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
25739	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
25740	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
25741	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
25742	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
25743	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
25744	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
25745	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
25746	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
25747	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
25748	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
25749	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
25750	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
25751	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
25752	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
25753	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
25754	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
25755	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
25756	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
25757	Her abdomen is benign.
25758	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
25759	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
25760	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
25761	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
25762	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
25763	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
25764	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
25765	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
25766	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
25767	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
25768	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
25769	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
25770	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
25771	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
25772	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
25773	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
25774	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
25775	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
25776	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
25777	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
25778	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
25779	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
25780	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
25781	Sincerely,

25818	Labs:   CBC: Pending
25819	Imaging: 
25820	LLE U/S at bedside: 3x2 cm simple fluid collection at cephalad portion of groin wound.
25821	Assessment/Plan: 
25822	- 52yoF s/p recent redo left fem-tib bypass with right arm vein with single episode of bleeding from left groin wound.
25823	This likely represents extrusion of a postoperative hematoma.
25824	There is currently no evidence of active bleeding from the wound.
25825	A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home.
25826	She will follow up with Dr. Ishikawa at her scheduled postop visit.
25827	Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
25828	D/W Dr. Casey Iacono (Surgery Fellow), who agrees with assessment and plan.

25912	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
25913	52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.
25914	On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.
25915	In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.
25916	The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.
25917	- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin
25918	- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan
25919	- NPO from midnight, pepcid
25920	- check chem7, CBC, coags
25921	- has an insulin pump
25922	- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

25948	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.
25949	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic
25950	vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial
25951	bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity
25952	cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.
25953	She was recently treated
25954	at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,
25955	had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex.
25956	She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48
25957	hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.
25958	She has
25959	also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not
25960	had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or
25961	other symptomatology.
25962	She has also not noticed any urinary
25963	symptoms of frequency.
25964	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,
25965	hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
25966	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and
25967	fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in
25968	2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.
25969	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies
25970	tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.
25971	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,
25972	respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on
25973	room air.
25974	General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no
25975	apparent distress.
25976	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation
25977	bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
25978	Cardiovascular: 
25979	Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
25980	GI:  The
25981	abdomen is soft.
25982	The patient does have insulin pump in place,
25983	but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.
25984	Skin is warm,
25985	dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,
25986	which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the
25987	right lower extremity.
25988	This erythema stops at the ankle and does
25989	not extend up above the knee.
25990	The patient also has an open
25991	chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot
25992	as well.
25993	There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:
25994	 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased
25995	sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.
25996	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated
25997	by me and the resident.
25998	I confirm that I have seen and evaluated
25999	the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the
26000	patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
26001	disposition with the patient as well as the resident.
26002	The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.
26003	CBC showed white
26004	count of 14 with shift.
26005	LFTs were within normal limits.
26006	X-ray
26007	of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray
26008	of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.
26009	Given the
26010	erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this
26011	vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of
26012	vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed
26013	outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting
26014	her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.
26015	The patient's
26016	erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be
26017	extremely atypical for a DVT.
26018	We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is
26019	followed closely by Surgery and this notification was
26020	made at 8:30 p.m.
26021	Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point
26022	we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she
26023	does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she
26024	needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on
26025	maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the
26026	hospital.
26027	DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
26028	CONDITION:  Stable.
26029	DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

26100	NAME: Marsh, Carl
26101	MRN: 99579205
26102	Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy
26103	Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney
26104	Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T
26105	Estimated dry weight: 61 kg
26106	Dialysis access: left AVF
26107	Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night
26108	HPI: 
26109	74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.
26110	The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.
26111	The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.
26112	Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.
26113	He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.
26114	It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.
26115	The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.
26116	He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).
26117	It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.
26118	He has been symptom-free since that time.
26119	He reports no other new events.
26120	He denies any new medications.

26210	ASSESSMENT:
26211	74 year old male who presents with:
26212	Myoclonus   unclear etiology without obvious precipitants; the last time this happened, it was in the setting of not getting dialyzed after three days.
26213	While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.
26214	In addition, he says that his dialysis center has been taking him off    early    a few times in the past week, though he notes that he got a full run yesterday (3    hours)
26215	chronic HD
26216	h/o MGUS   shoulder fat pads
26217	PLAN:
26218	Admit to Renal Medicine service, Dr. Tierney attending
26219	Will plan on dialysis tomorrow for two reasons: (1) high potassium, (2) see if this helps with myoclonus
26220	Will contact dialysis center tomorrow to see if any problems with his runs, and what his most recent URR or Kt/V was
26221	continue Phos-Lo 2001 tid with meals

26290	I will therefore not change anything
26291	today.
26292	The patient is at his goal LDL
26293	level.
26294	I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.
26295	I
26296	will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.
26297	The patient will follow up with his
26298	psychiatrist and therapist.
26299	He will let me know his actual
26300	medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.

26303	4.
26304	Healthcare maintenance.
26305	I have emphasized to the
26306	patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as
26307	increasing his exercise.
26308	He is not interested in any
26309	exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to
26310	walk longer and faster.
26311	He had a negative flexible
26312	sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool
26313	cards today.
26314	His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is
26315	not interested in the booster today.
26316	His immunizations are
26317	otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the
26318	remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the
26319	next visit in 3 months' time.

26468	Mucus membranes were moist.
26469	Abdomen was
26470	soft.
26471	Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
26472	LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a normal chest x-ray, negative
26473	urinalysis.
26474	White blood cell count was 7.12.
26475	He had a
26476	creatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8.
26477	His chest x-ray showed no acute process.
26478	IMPRESSION:  My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis
26479	by virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his
26480	creatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the
26481	Emergency Department as a bolus.
26482	Given that pneumonia and
26483	urinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to
26484	treat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.
26485	He will be admitted to
26486	the Medical Service.

26576	IMPRESSION/PLAN:

26588	pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due.
26589	2.
26590	Diabetes.
26591	The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes 
26592	but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it.
26593	creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
26594	elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment.
26595	We will start her on 
26596	Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d.
26597	I expect we will need to increase this and if 
26598	she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week.
26599	I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
26600	or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication.
26601	I suggested 
26602	she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
26603	eating.
26604	I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry.
26605	She also 
26606	requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with 
26607	592 Kristina Street                                Xia, Jean

26916	Prominent systolic murmur(s?).
26917	Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
26918	There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.

26920	Minimally elevated troponins.
26921	Uncertain significance.

26923	Anemia, mildly microcytic.
26924	9.
26925	Elevated LDH.
26926	10.
26927	Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.
26928	11.
26929	History of hypertension.
26930	Discussion:
26931	Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.
26932	She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.
26933	The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.
26934	Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.
26935	She should not receive diuretics at present.
26936	Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.
26937	I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.
26938	The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.
26939	We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.
26940	The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.
26941	Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.
26942	Suggest:
26943	Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.
26944	IV normal saline.
26945	May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.
26946	Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.
26947	Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.
26948	Agree with check echocardiogram.
26949	We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.
26950	Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

26965	ID/CC: no appetite, acute renal failure
26966	HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97.
26967	At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss.
26968	In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes.
26969	The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma.
26970	Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV.
26971	The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.
26972	Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process.
26973	Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population.
26974	Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.
26975	The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced.
26976	On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed.
26977	Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia.
26978	Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization.
26979	Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.
26980	She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth.
26981	She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family.
26982	She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection.
26983	Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes.
26984	She has not had a bowel movement for several days.
26985	She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.
26986	In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization.
26987	She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household.
26988	She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally.
26989	She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game.
26990	She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
26991	ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%.

27099	Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression.
27100	This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

27130	HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.
27131	She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.
27132	This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.
27133	She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.
27134	The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.
27135	The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.
27136	She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.
27137	She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.
27138	ED COURSE:  
27139	On arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/RA.
27140	Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.
27141	CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.
27142	She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.
27143	She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.
27144	ROS
27145	As above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past).

27273	RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
27274	CXR (12/14):     Lines/tubes:  Interval placement of left-sided PICC line the tip of the PICC line does not cross midline there is a nasogastric tube with the tip below the diaphragm
27275	     Lungs:  There is a persistent opacity in the left mid hemithorax
27276	     Pleura:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
27277	Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are normal.
27278	CT Abd (12/14):     LOWER THORAX: There been interval resolution of the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions.
27279	There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases.
27280	HEPATOBILIARY: No focal hepatic lesions.
27281	No biliary ductal dilatation.
27282	There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder.
27283	SPLEEN: No splenomegaly.
27284	PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.
27285	ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
27286	KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions.
27287	Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
27288	PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place.
27289	There is a fibroid uterus.
27290	PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.
27291	There is trace free fluid.
27292	LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
27293	VESSELS: There are scattered vascular calcifications.
27294	An IVC filter is in place.
27295	GI TRACT: There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.
27296	There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.
27297	There has been a prior  a prior colostomy.
27298	There is diverticulosis.
27299	BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
27300	IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.
27301	Alternately, this could reflect ileus.
27302	Close clinical follow up advised.
27303	EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL
27304	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
27305	Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  
27306	SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.
27307	Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.
27308	Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.
27309	Appreciate surgery input
27310	NGT to low wall suction
27311	NPO except meds for bowel rest
27312	Serial abdominal exams
27313	Check colostomy output guaiac
27314	Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.
27315	With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.
27316	Continue IVF while NPO
27317	Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
27318	Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.
27319	She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
27320	She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.
27321	Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.
27322	Transfuse 1U PRBCs
27323	Check colostomy guaiac
27324	Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
27325	Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.
27326	She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.
27327	She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.
27328	Hold Coumadin for now
27329	Follow up INR, goal 2-3
27330	HOCM/HTN: 
27331	Continue lopressor, verapamil
27332	Sarcoid:
27333	Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
27334	PAF
27335	Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio
27336	F/E/N:  NPO
27337	PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen

27348	Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23).
27349	She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli.
27350	She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX.
27351	Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection.
27352	Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility.
27353	Patient has no complaints.
27354	Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills.
27355	However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED.

27445	Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.
27446	Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.
27447	This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage.

27451	A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks.
27452	1.
27453	Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear.
27454	It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection.
27455	At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI.
27456	Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
27457	In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression.
27458	- F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures
27459	                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 
27460	                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)
27461	- Culture if spikes
27462	                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 
27463	                 improve
27464	2.
27465	Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past.
27466	During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy.
27467	GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy.
27468	It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive.
27469	- Type and screen
27470	                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement
27471	                - Check post-transfusion Hct 
27472	3.
27473	HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents
27474	                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB
27475	                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)
27476	4.
27477	Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR.
27478	Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding.
27479	As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her.
27480	- Monitor daily INRs
27481	                - Hold warfarin overnight
27482	5.
27483	Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2).

27500	EDVISIT^32612454^Barr, Nicky^01/13/93^IP, CARRIE
27501	I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Xue.
27502	I confirm
27503	that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the
27504	resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed
27505	the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
27506	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 57-year-old with back pain.
27507	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a young woman with a
27508	complicated past medical history, presents with a chronic history
27509	of low back pain, worse over the last week.
27510	She states that 3
27511	years ago, she had a motor vehicle accident.
27512	Since that time,
27513	has had chronic low back pain.
27514	She has been able to ambulate at
27515	home.
27516	Denies any fevers, rashes, history of urinary
27517	incontinence, weakness, or numbness.
27518	She went to EDUCARE-FARGO earlier
27519	this week and was prescribed Percocet, comes here now because the
27520	patient's family and the patient would like to change her care to
27521	Lansing Dover Clinic.
27522	Denies any numbness or weakness.
27523	States that she is no longer taking her pills at home.
27524	Denies
27525	any suicidal or homicidal ideation, has a flat affect.
27526	any depression.
27527	Her son, however, with whom she lives disagrees
27528	and is very concerned that she may be depressed.
27529	He is also very
27530	concerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is
27531	not caring for herself well at home.
27532	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and
27533	a prior stroke.
27534	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has also had knee surgery.
27535	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per
27536	the written note.
27537	The patient was counseled regarding smoking
27538	cessation.
27539	MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.
27540	ALLERGIES:  None.
27541	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute
27542	distress.
27543	Vital signs are within normal limits as documented.
27544	For full physical exam findings, please see the resident's
27545	written note.
27546	Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,
27547	rectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as
27548	documented.
27549	Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in
27550	the groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to
27551	obesity.
27552	Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.
27553	Range
27554	of motion is full.
27555	Strength and tone is normal.
27556	The patient
27557	does have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing
27558	her back pain.
27559	Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but
27560	is oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic
27561	deficit in either motor or sensory distribution.
27562	She does,
27563	however, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.
27564	LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.
27565	BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,
27566	respectively.
27567	Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.
27568	Urinalysis is
27569	positive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and
27570	2+ bacteria.
27571	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient
27572	is her inability to care for self at home.
27573	It is apparent that
27574	her son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient
27575	on physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am
27576	concerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying
27577	neurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from
27578	thriving at home.
27579	Psychiatry initially was consulted.
27580	Their
27581	impression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem
27582	that needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a
27583	specific providers within the next 2 weeks.
27584	The patient was
27585	treated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.
27586	Care
27587	coordinator and social services were consulted.
27588	The patient will
27589	have a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary
27590	care services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and
27591	will likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication
27592	compliance and other ADLs.

28521	Patient Name:      Leon
28522	MRN:                      43634211
28523	Date:                      0021
28524	Consult reason:  
28525	?abnormal gait
28526	HPI:  53RHM who going to bed Wednesday was in usoh, but Thursday 2:30AM awoke w/ terrible HA, so came to ED; got CT head and LP, both negative for blood.
28527	However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s.
28528	I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged.
28529	Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight.
28530	He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone.
28531	However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait.
28532	An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI.
28533	Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx.
28534	Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints.
28535	He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone.
28536	VS in ED tonight: BP 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA
28537	Blood glucose not measured tonight.
28538	ROS: 
28539	Negative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait.
28540	General review of systems negative for:  fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).
28541	MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)
28542	ALL: nkda
28543	PMH: 
28544	-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night
28545	-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)
28546	SH: denies t/e/d, works as &#8220;Pipefitter&#8221;
28547	FH: HTN, DM
28548	Neurologic Examination: 
28549	MS: unpleasant, uncooperative w/ history, angry about being in the ED still

28589	Some difficulty w/ tandem walk.
28590	Negative Romberg.
28591	A/P:  53RHM w/ HTN urgency yesterday, newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in 300-400s yesterday, who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative w/u for SAH, now back again for same HA, which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP (current BP 150s) and w/ medications.
28592	Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems.
28593	Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education.
28594	In any case, I find no acute neurological issues.
28595	Recs: 
28596	-BP management
28597	-DM management.
28598	Thanks for this interesting consult.

28601	Keith Gilbert, MD, PhD, 
28602	Neurology resident PGY3
28603	Addendum: 
28604	He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 
28605	A note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.
28606	He is doing much better today.
28607	He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;

28714	77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.
28715	At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.
28716	This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.
28717	In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.
28718	Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.
28719	Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.
28720	She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).
28721	Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.
28722	A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.
28723	In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.
28724	Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.
28725	She has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.
28726	Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.
28727	She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.
28728	ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).

28808	She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.
28809	Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.
28810	This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).
28811	Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.
28812	However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.
28813	Recs:
28814	- Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV, prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12-day outpatient taper (40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 3 days)
28815	- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks
28816	- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
28817	- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)
28818	Procedure: R knee aspiration
28819	Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent.
28820	The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach.
28821	1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella.
28822	A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn.
28823	A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.
28824	Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.
28825	Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

29161	Reason for Visit
29162	Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.
29163	We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.
29164	He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.
29165	He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.
29166	Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.
29167	He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.
29168	His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.
29169	I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.
29170	He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.
29171	He is worried about his remaining vision.
29172	He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.
29173	She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.
29174	He also is having trouble sleeping.
29175	He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.
29176	He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.
29177	He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

29373	Correct hyponatremia
29374	b.
29375	Monitor mental status as infection is treated
29376	Falls:  Pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology.
29377	Pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on MMSE), possible diabetic neuropathy, and 
29378	Check orthostatic vital signs
29379	Check RPR/B12
29380	"c.	Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate"
29381	Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Pt clinically appears hypovolemic.
29382	A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.
29383	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs
29384	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).
29385	Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.
29386	A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.
29387	Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

29493	12/09/95
29494	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
29495	including subacute weight loss.
29496	IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
29497	75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.
29498	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
29499	severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.
29500	She
29501	has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation.
29502	Past right carotid endarterectomy.
29503	In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
29504	cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
29505	pneumonia.
29506	She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
29507	artery and left common carotid artery.
29508	She had subsequent
29509	episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
29510	with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.
29511	She is followed closely by
29512	Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
29513	interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.
29514	During her most recent hospitalization she had some
29515	confusion which was attributed to low sodium.
29516	This was
29517	felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
29518	SIADH.
29519	This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
29520	boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
29521	Lasix.
29522	No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
29523	Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
29524	Baseline weight 170 pounds.
29525	Weight in early September, 167
29526	pounds.
29527	Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.
29528	"Weight <PHI TYPE=""DATE"">November "
29529	28th</PHI>, 141 pounds.
29530	Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.
29531	She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
29532	revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.
29533	The
29534	G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
29535	never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
29536	Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
29537	with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
29538	swallow.
29539	Her caloric p.o.
29540	intake sounds as if it has been
29541	quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
29542	foods here and there.
29543	She is drinking two or three can of
29544	booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
29545	needs.
29546	Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
29547	(phone number 507.741.8042).
29548	Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
29549	potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
29550	1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.
29551	The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
29552	her weight has decreased.
29553	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
29554	blood per rectum within the last week.
29555	The patient's
29556	daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
29557	early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.
29558	patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
29559	visit.
29560	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
29561	1.
29562	Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above.
29563	2.
29564	Throat cancer in early 2060s.
29565	Status post XRT to the
29566	neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
29567	vertebral disease).
29568	3.
29569	Breast cancer.
29570	Details unknown.
29571	Will review at next

29579	6.
29580	Hypertension.
29581	Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
29582	170.
29583	7.
29584	Hypothyroidism.
29585	Recent TSH normal.
29586	8.
29587	Glaucoma.
29588	9.
29589	Anxiety.
29590	Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
29591	basis.
29592	This was apparently a large factor during her recent
29593	hospitalizations.

29637	Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
29638	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
29639	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.
29640	Her
29641	daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.
29642	Another daughter is staying with the
29643	patient full-time.
29644	Visiting nurse is involved.
29645	Previous to
29646	the last few months, the patient was fairly independent.
29647	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
29648	GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
29649	on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
29650	and carefully.
29651	Has a cane, but does not always use it.
29652	VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
29653	and 171/74 on repeat.
29654	Pulse 80.
29655	Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
29656	clothed.
29657	ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.
29658	Soft, nontender and
29659	nondistended.
29660	No hepatosplenomegaly.
29661	No masses.
29662	G-tube is
29663	flushed with water, and flushes easily.
29664	G-tube site itself
29665	is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.
29666	LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
29667	HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
29668	No murmurs.
29669	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
29670	Weight loss.
29671	Probably due to poor caloric intake.
29672	This
29673	is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
29674	progressively cachectic and weak.
29675	This is probably
29676	attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia.
29677	She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
29678	Tuesday.
29679	I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
29680	that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
29681	of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate.
29682	She should continue to take p.o.
29683	foods as tolerated, but she
29684	needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
29685	since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.
29686	Will try Glucerna
29687	because of her diabetes history.
29688	The patient's daughter and
29689	the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
29690	Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
29691	Nutrition Clinic in two days.
29692	Cerebrovascular disease.
29693	Followed closely by Neurology.
29694	No acute change in neuro status today.
29695	Will continue
29696	Coumadin.
29697	Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
29698	this.
29699	Recent INR 1.4.
29700	Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
29701	IM nurse.
29702	I need to review these records more closely, and
29703	try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.
29704	In
29705	the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently.
29706	Diabetes.
29707	Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
29708	to 350 range.
29709	Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
29710	range over the past few days.
29711	Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
29712	Finger-sticks three to four times daily.
29713	Further
29714	adjustments PRN.
29715	Our current goal is simply to maintain her
29716	sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.
29717	Once her
29718	dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
29719	tighter control.
29720	Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
29721	troubles with p.o.
29722	intake.
29723	Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.
29724	Daughter
29725	will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
29726	take it from there.
29727	Constipation.
29728	Continue Colace.
29729	Add Dulcolax PRN.
29730	Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.
29731	If she does
29732	have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
29733	her ability to eat successfully.
29734	Currently in reasonable control.
29735	Goal BP
29736	140 to 170, systolic.
29737	Initial severe hypertension this
29738	visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
29739	for her.
29740	Follow-up at next visit.
29741	Followed by Psychiatry.
29742	Extensive reassurance
29743	given today to the patient.
29744	She is very concerned about her
29745	weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
29746	take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion.
29747	Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd
29748	watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
29749	Multiple other issues.
29750	To be addressed at further
29751	visits.
29752	Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
29753	her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
29754	Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

29768	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
29769	reevaluate Coumadin.
29770	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
29771	77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
29772	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.
29773	Last
29774	week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
29775	It was a very very windy day.
29776	Afterwards she was outside and a
29777	huge gust of wind knocked her over.
29778	Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
29779	her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
29780	the wind blew.
29781	There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
29782	of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode.
29783	She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
29784	left eyebrow.
29785	She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
29786	CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
29787	lateral edge of her left eyebrow.
29788	She had films of her wrist and
29789	hips both of which were fine.
29790	She has bruising in these areas.
29791	Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
29792	back to normal.
29793	She had marked hypertension up to 250.
29794	She was treated with
29795	hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
29796	some hematuria.
29797	Her blood pressure at home since then has been
29798	180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.
29799	She
29800	is not on a beta-blocker currently.
29801	She has not had any episodes
29802	of chest pain.
29803	She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.
29804	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o.
29805	b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
29806	q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
29807	lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
29808	p.r.n., levothyroxine
29809	100 mg p.o.
29810	q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.
29811	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas.
29812	She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.
29813	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
29814	weight 148 pounds.
29815	GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
29816	HEENT: PERRL.
29817	Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
29818	eyebrow is easily removed.
29819	No evidence of any infection.
29820	Her
29821	left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
29822	shoulder.
29823	Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
29824	bony step-offs.
29825	She walks well with no pain in her left hip.
29826	There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
29827	bursa.
29828	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
29829	bruising but no more serious complications.
29830	Fortunately she did
29831	not have intracranial bleeding.
29832	I am not sure why her blood
29833	pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
29834	falls verses independent causes.
29835	Given that the high blood
29836	pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
29837	q.d.,
29838	and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
29839	see how well this is working.
29840	Goal BP 140-160 systolic.
29841	urine was checked today.
29842	Hematuria has resolved.
29843	She has 2+
29844	proteinuria.
29845	I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
29846	her hypertension.
29847	We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
29848	and benefits of Coumadin therapy.
29849	Although she is at risk for
29850	falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
29851	Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke.
29852	She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
29853	that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke.
29854	I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
29855	hemorrhage and its consequences.
29856	I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
29857	month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
29858	working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
29859	increased risk for falls.
29860	It seems to me that she is in a gray
29861	area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
29862	for Coumadin for her.
29863	She feels very strongly that she wishes to
29864	continue.
29865	This was discussed in detail with her and her
29866	daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.
29867	I
29868	encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her

29880	"Betty has been doing ""okay"" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability."
29881	She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.
29882	Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.
29883	She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.
29884	She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.
29885	Echocardiogram:
29886	Date: 9/02/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF.
29887	Posterobasal HK.

29890	MRI/A:
29891	CTA:
29892	"3/20/98: ""severe proximal LICA stenosis"", just distal to bifurcation...no comment on comparison."
29893	9/29/95:  >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.
29894	>90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.
29895	70-75% LICA.
29896	The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.
29897	Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse.
29898	>50% in B ECAs.
29899	9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.
29900	Rbif without significant stenosis.
29901	RVA dominant.
29902	Ultrasound:
29903	8/24/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%
29904	"  	  	  	  	  	  	Angiography:"
29905	8/27/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R.
29906	Right vertebral irregular/stenotic.
29907	LCCA, bifurcation, LICA with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-LCCA, >80%.
29908	Functional Cerebrovascular Studies:
29909	Diamox SPECT 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.
29910	Vascular Procedures:
29911	Right CEA (years ago)

29943	"  	  	  	  	  	"
29944	Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.
29945	She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.
29946	Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.
29947	Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.
29948	Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.
29949	This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.
29950	Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.
29951	Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.
29952	She is unable to tandem gait.
29953	Impression:
29954	Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
29955	She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.
29956	Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.
29957	My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.
29958	I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.
29959	I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.
29960	I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.
29961	I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.
29962	I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.
29963	Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.
29964	I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.
29965	This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.
29966	While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

30315	DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
30316	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
30317	The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
30318	In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
30319	There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
30320	This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.
30321	The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
30322	She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.
30323	The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
30324	She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
30325	The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
30326	Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
30327	Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.
30328	There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
30329	On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.
30330	MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
30331	The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
30332	MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
30333	Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
30334	Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
30335	It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
30336	Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
30337	Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
30338	There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
30339	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
30340	The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
30341	There are no medication allergies reported.
30342	PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.
30343	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.
30344	Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.
30345	She uses alcohol occasionally.
30346	She has a 12th grade education.
30347	She lives alone and is a widow.
30348	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.
30349	The patient is overweight.
30350	Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
30351	Weight is 217 pounds.
30352	Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.
30353	Poor neck posture is noted.
30354	Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
30355	Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.
30356	Temporal arteries are normal.
30357	Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
30358	Romberg is negative.
30359	Tandem gait is normal.
30360	The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
30361	There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
30362	This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
30363	There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
30364	NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.
30365	Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.
30366	Extraocular movements are full.
30367	Visual fields are intact.
30368	There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.
30369	Hearing is intact.
30370	Oropharynx is normal.
30371	Palate elevates well.
30372	Tongue is midline.
30373	Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
30374	Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
30375	There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
30376	Coordination testing today seemed intact.
30377	Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
30378	Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.
30379	Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.
30380	IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.
30381	Comment.
30382	I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
30383	I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
30384	Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
30385	In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
30386	It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
30387	PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
30388	She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
30389	We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
30390	We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
30391	It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.
30392	For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
30393	I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
30394	She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
30395	We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

31242	The patient is a 72-year-old male, paraplegic, referred for evaluation of recurrent bladder infections.
31243	The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.
31244	The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.
31245	He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.
31246	He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.
31247	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.
31248	No history of kidney stones.

31270	IMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.
31271	PLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.

32334	RE:  MCKEE, Norma 
32335	MR#: 6987776 
32336	DOB:  7/7/75 
32337	Dear Robert, 
32338	Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee, a 51-year-old female patient with the history of seizure disorder, hypertension, borderline diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms, and depressive disorder, who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent polysomnographic abnormalities.
32339	"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As you already know, Ms. Mckee describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses, and describes a ""restless sleep"", but only relatively recently (over the last five months, particularly after 12/26 of last year)."
32340	She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.
32341	"She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves ""sleeping around the clock"" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration."
32342	The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.
32343	"She states that she is so tired that she can ""fall asleep right after breakfast""."
32344	She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.
32345	Ms. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy.
32346	She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m.
32347	and three tablets po q.h.s.
32348	"While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of ""diffuse"" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below)."
32349	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Celexa, Zestril, Prilosec, carbamazepine (200 mg tablets, four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night), clonazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, Premarin, tetracycline and klor-con.
32350	ALLERGIES:  No adverse drug allergies reported.
32351	SLEEP HISTORY:  Sleep onset intended for 11:00 p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.  She describes one to two early morning awakenings, with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance.
32352	Sleep offset initially occurs at 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and sometimes as late as 10:00 a.m.
32353	The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration (up to four hours).
32354	The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness, will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep.
32355	Patient may sleep until 3:00 p.m. on certain given afternoons.
32356	"The patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as ""restless"" sleep."
32357	She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder.
32358	She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
32359	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
32360	1.
32361	Seizure disorder.
32362	2.
32363	Hypertension.
32364	3.
32365	Borderline diabetes.
32366	4.
32367	Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
32368	5.
32369	Depressive disorder.
32370	6.
32371	Panic related symptoms.
32372	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies active tobacco use.
32373	She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease.
32374	She averages two cups of tea per day.
32375	While describing an overweight status, she has increased her weight by 10-20 pounds over the past four years.
32376	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies.
32377	Speech is clear and fluent.
32378	Receptive language functioning essentially intact.
32379	No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
32380	No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted.
32381	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
32382	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
32383	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
32384	"No acute evidence of ""microsleeps"" are noted."
32385	On HEENT examination, there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal apeture, with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula, as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size.
32386	Vital signs include a blood pressure of 144/88 (seated, left arm) and a heart rate of 88, with a respiratory rate of 14.
32387	IMPRESSION:  
32388	Hypersomnia (780.54):  Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals.
32389	Other diagnostic possibilities include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy (although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy).
32390	Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (780.53):  Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of 26 per hour as noted during a recent 3/26/27 sleep study with associated O2 desaturations down to 76 percent.
32391	Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted.
32392	Seizure disorder:  Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy.
32393	PLAN:  
32394	"Suggest regular home CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure)."
32395	Pending clinical response, will reassess the patient's level of alertness, decrease amount of early morning awakenings, and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in 12-14 weeks times.
32396	In addition, patient is advised to continue efforts at weight reduction, use of an oro-dental, and/or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms.
32397	Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m.
32398	until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made.
32399	Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in 12-14 weeks time.
32400	Once again, thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee.
32401	I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.
32402	Sincerely, 
32403	Salvador B. Irvin, M.D.
32404	Department of Sleep Studies 
32405	ADDENDUM:  Sleep study results (3/26/27):  
32406	Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive (82) and partially obstructive apneas (63) during supine sleep, as well as intermittent hypopneas (19) and nocturnal hypoventilations, intermittent snore arousals (4) and episodes of moderate snoring (respiratory disturbance index = 26 per hour) with associated arousals and O2 desaturations down to 76%.
32407	Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved, the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented.
32408	"CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances, help consolidate sleep, as well as improve O2 saturations (i.e., to 96% and above, even during REM supine sleep) and overall sleep stage architecture."
32409	"Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep, activated during both ""light"" non-REM, as well as stage REM sleep (index = 8 per hour) with infrequent limb associated arousals (index = 1 per hour) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep (the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition)."
32410	Cardiac rates typically ranged between 72-87 beats per minute; average 80 beats per minute.
32411	"EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of ""diffuse"" spike-wave discharges were evident during light sleep, without associated clinical accompaniment."
32412	"Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre-CPAP conditions, but with prominent ""slow wave and REM rebounds"" subsequently noted with CPAP administration; i.e., accounting for more than 41% and more than 31% of the CPAP sleep times, respectively."

32756	RE:  Xavier Olive
32757	Dear Michael,
32758	Mr. Xavier Olive presents for evaluation, thanks for your
32759	referral.
32760	As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is
32761	status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
32762	lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
32763	popliteal artery on the left.
32764	The patient presents now for
32765	"further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms""."
32766	The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
32767	there are about equivalent in nature.
32768	He has very minimal low
32769	back pain.
32770	He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
32771	be associated with some abnormal gait.
32772	He states on a bad day
32773	its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
32774	high as 8-9/10.
32775	The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
32776	by things like walking.
32777	He can walk less than one block at which
32778	point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
32779	shuffling and occasionally falling.
32780	When he is having severe
32781	symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.
32782	He denies any bowel or
32783	bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
32784	UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
32785	He has very
32786	little back pain associated with his symptomatology.
32787	He has had
32788	no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.
32789	He
32790	describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
32791	states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
32792	Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.
32793	His weight is
32794	steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.
32795	doesn't smoke and drinks socially.
32796	Quit smoking 33 years ago.
32797	He does not think he will ever be pain free.
32798	Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
32799	and he has been for the past couple of years.
32800	He has difficulty
32801	with sleep.
32802	He has a balance problem and also has benign
32803	prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
32804	for this he takes Cardura.
32805	He has a history of high blood
32806	pressure.
32807	Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.
32808	No
32809	respiratory malfunction.
32810	"He has had surgery for something ""in"
32811	"his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery."
32812	He is on Plavix and
32813	aspirin.
32814	Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
32815	appearing male.
32816	He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
32817	side his T band seems to be slightly weak.
32818	Single toe raises
32819	show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.
32820	He has no
32821	tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.
32822	He has
32823	negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.
32824	Forward flexion allows him
32825	to get to the patella.
32826	Extension is pain free and passive
32827	hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.
32828	Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.
32829	Sensory is
32830	symmetric.
32831	He has negative straight leg raises.
32832	palpable pulses.
32833	He is hairless in his lower extremities.
32834	had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
32835	"that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality""."
32836	He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
32837	and for his gastroesophageal reflux.
32838	Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
32839	with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
32840	his iliac artery on the right.
32841	CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
32842	hypertrophy.
32843	At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
32844	disk disease.
32845	I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
32846	see me after that.
32847	Thanks for the referral.

32945	"			Reason for visit:"
32946	   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.
32947	Interval History:
32948	   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
32949	His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.
32950	Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.
32951	He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.
32952	Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.
32953	He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.
32954	The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.
32955	The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.
32956	Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.
32957	The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.
32958	His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.
32959	It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.
32960	At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.
32961	Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.
32962	The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.
32963	Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.
32964	Past medical history:
32965	   Diabetes, onset in 2135.
32966	Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.
32967	The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.
32968	MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.

33012	Physical examination:
33013	-Pulse:   68 and regular.
33014	Afebrile
33015	-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.
33016	Equal bilaterally
33017	-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.
33018	Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance
33019	-Skin:   Without rashes
33020	-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils
33021	-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.
33022	No JVD
33023	-Chest:   Clear
33024	-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs

33029	Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.
33030	Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.
33031	Good capillary refill
33032	-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.
33033	His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.
33034	He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.
33035	Otherwise, no focal deficits
33036	Procedures:
33037	Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.
33038	92 and 1.03, respectively.
33039	The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.
33040	I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.
33041	EKG:
33042	    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.
33043	There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.
33044	Other Data:
33045	   DOB: 11/25/2083.
33046	Assessment and plan:
33047	   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.
33048	Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.
33049	Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.
33050	On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.
33051	His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.
33052	I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.
33053	1.
33054	As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.
33055	Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.
33056	2.
33057	Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.
33058	PLAN: 
33059	Formal exercise ABIs.
33060	Obtain angiographic studies from AC.

33118	pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.
33119	The orthostatic change was
33120	symptomatic.
33121	He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
33122	6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when

33129	face, 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity, 0 in the
33130	right lower extremity, 0 in the left lower extremity,.
33131	Action or postural tremor of the hands was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0
33132	being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.
33133	Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
33134	upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
33135	1 in the left lower extremity,.
33136	The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal):

33154	Assessment:  
33155	  1.
33156	Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
33157	It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
33158	pressure.
33159	I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH.
33160	In addition Dr
33161	Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his

33180	"LOW BACK PAIN	      "
33181	he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.
33182	He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.
33183	He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Dr. Conley.
33184	A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.
33185	He will be seeing Dr. Sheehan.
33186	Mr. Whitehead is contemplating surgery as he cannot walk without pain.
33187	"Elevated blood sugar	      "
33188	BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.
33189	He has been on meds for NIDDM.
33190	He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and is now seeing endocrine.
33191	His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage 500 mg qd.
33192	He has regular optho exam and is on zestoretic.
33193	Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.
33194	His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.
33195	To see endocrine in 9/71.
33196	"hyperlipidemia	      "
33197	now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.
33198	He has NIDDM and HTN.
33199	His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.
33200	LFT were normal.
33201	COntinue med.

33203	Now on zestoretic 20/25 qd + atenolol 50 mg qd.
33204	He has significant white coat component.
33205	It is again high at 170/80 in left arm.
33206	His BP reading in hospital for myelogram this week was 130/80.
33207	No change.
33208	"h/o PROSTATITIS	      "
33209	had recurring prostatitis sx's and saw Dr. Dotson.

33211	He is on flomax 0.4 mg qd and doing better.
33212	His PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70.
33213	To see Dr. Dotson soon.
33214	"Neurological symptoms	      "
33215	he reports having intolerance to bright lights, tingling in his mid anterior abdomen and chest as well as numbness in his left middle three digits with some neck discomfort.
33216	His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities.
33217	His sx's sound like left-sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about  systemic demyelinating conditions.
33218	Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. Conley.
33219	[08/28/70]
33220	TSH and B12 levels were normal.
33221	His sx's in his eyes and abdomen have essentially resolved.
33222	He still has some cervical radiculopathy syptoms.
33223	He will see Dr. Conley (yet to do so).

33226	He now has right neck pain.
33227	His left sided numbness has resolved.
33228	Again referred him to Dr. Conley.
33229	He likely has cervical radiculopathy.

33291	Dr. Sheehan felt that pain may be from some instability vs scar tissue from prior surgery.
33292	Fusion surgery was discussed but Mr. Whitehead is not too keen on it.
33293	[12/25/71]

33328	ATTENDING:  Bell, Charley
33329	Source: Patient and chart
33330	CC:  Diarrhea
33331	HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.
33332	In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.
33333	After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.
33334	Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.
33335	Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.
33336	He received 21 days of flagyl.
33337	After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.
33338	Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.
33339	He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.
33340	One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.
33341	At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.
33342	Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.
33343	He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.
33344	He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness.
33345	He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.
33346	ED:  Afebrile, HR 70s.
33347	Hypertensive to 189/82.
33348	He was given 1000 cc NS, 5 mg PO amlodipine, 20 mg PO lisinopril, 500 mg IV flagyl.

33502	Quick
33503	"ATCH: 		655-75-45"
33504	Dear Harry and Yair:
33505	My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
33506	As you know, she is just 52 years of age.
33507	Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.
33508	She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
33509	She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
33510	She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
33511	On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.
33512	This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.
33513	In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
33514	There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
33515	She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
33516	By last spring, i.e.
33517	a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
33518	She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
33519	Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
33520	Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.
33521	Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???
33522	length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
33523	Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
33524	She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
33525	She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
33526	On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.
33527	Pulse was 70 and regular.
33528	Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
33529	She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.
33530	There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
33531	She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
33532	This is of course a very unhappy situation.
33533	Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
33534	However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
33535	I would suggest the following.
33536	Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.
33537	Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
33538	She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
33539	If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
33540	I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
33541	My thanks once again.
33542	With every best wish.
33543	Sincerely,
33544	Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

33728	cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg
33729	HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.
33730	Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.
33731	Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.
33732	She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.
33733	She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.
33734	She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.
33735	Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.
33736	She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.
33737	She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).
33738	She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).
33739	She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

33905	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Falling and low back pain.
33906	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.
33907	The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.
33908	There was no obvious leg buckling.
33909	She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.
33910	Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.
33911	MEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d.
33912	without significant effect on her low back pain.
33913	Ultram q.i.d.
33914	was beneficial.
33915	Neurontin 300 q.i.d.
33916	which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.
33917	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.
33918	She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.
33919	She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.
33920	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.
33921	She has had left knee arthroscopy.
33922	She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.
33923	She has had a ten year history of diabetes.
33924	She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.
33925	MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.
33926	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
33927	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.
33928	No history of tobacco or alcohol.
33929	FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.
33930	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female.
33931	Her mental state examination is normal.
33932	Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
33933	Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.
33934	Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.
33935	DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.
33936	Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.
33937	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.
33938	We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.
33939	For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.
33940	We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.
33941	The patient will return to clinic after these studies.
33942	The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.

33949	      Team A Intern Admit Note
33950	Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey
33951	MR#  0942207
33952	Date of Admission:  8/26/66
33953	Attending: Yoel Pollard
33954	PCP:  Susan Ullom
33955	CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status
33956	HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)
33957	Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.
33958	She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66.
33959	Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.
33960	She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.
33961	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed.
33962	However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.
33963	8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear.
33964	U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin.
33965	There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.
33966	Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.
33967	Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days.
33968	She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.
33969	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus.
33970	She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.
33971	PMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)
33972	1.

34079	No change in ventricle size.
34080	No acute infarct; although, this is
34081	"	better assessed with MR with diffusion."
34082	Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale
34083	"	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due"
34084	"	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup."
34085	"EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals."
34086	Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam.
34087	No evidence of acute ischemia.
34088	Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.
34089	Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source.
34090	Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66.
34091	Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.
34092	-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures
34093	-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism
34094	UTI
34095	-likely UTI- tx
34096	-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source
34097	-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic
34098	-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data
34099	-change foley now
34100	-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics
34101	Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status
34102	-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
34103	If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection
34104	-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm.
34105	If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic.
34106	If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.
34107	DM
34108	-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements
34109	Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH
34110	GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary
34111	HTN-continue home medications
34112	wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer

34233	Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine
34234	693-31-18-1
34235	I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.
34236	The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.
34237	He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.
34238	In August he suffered a stroke.
34239	He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.
34240	He recalls no problem with his vision.
34241	He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.
34242	He does no know the extent of the evaluation.
34243	He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.
34244	He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.
34245	His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.
34246	He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.
34247	He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.
34248	The dizziness is worst in the morning.
34249	He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.
34250	He has DM and HTN.
34251	He is a nonsmoker.
34252	I don't have cholesterol information.
34253	There is no history of cardiac disease.
34254	There is no history of alcohol abuse.
34255	He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.
34256	He has no known allergies.
34257	He is aware of no significant family history.
34258	He is married.
34259	He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.
34260	He came to america from Honduras in 2073.
34261	He worked nights in construction until his stroke.
34262	Pulse 66, regular.
34263	BP 186/110.
34264	There are no cranial bruits.
34265	The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.
34266	The lungs are clear.
34267	The heart is regular with no murmur.
34268	The abdomen is benign.
34269	The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.
34270	He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.
34271	His fluency in his native language is probably normal.
34272	Cranial nerves are intact.
34273	There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.
34274	(He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)
34275	Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.
34276	The tone is only mildly increased.
34277	Sensation is intact.
34278	Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).
34279	The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.
34280	Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.
34281	He wears a right AFO.
34282	He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.
34283	His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.
34284	This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.
34285	He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.
34286	Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.
34287	To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.
34288	I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.
34289	He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.
34290	He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.
34291	I asked him to return here in a month to review this.
34292	Sincerely,
34293	Patrick Winn, M.D.

34658	CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts
34659	"CTA: pending	"
34660	"MRI/MRA:	pending"
34661	Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms.
34662	Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait.
34663	Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits.
34664	However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.
34665	Plan:   
34666	-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis
34667	Check MRI brain stroke protocol
34668	Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180
34669	Control hyperglycemia
34670	If stroke present, admit to Neurology.
34671	R/O MI
34672	Discussed with Dr. Costello.
34673	Thank you for this interesting consult.

34680	535-022-8716                                           08/15/67
34681	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.
34682	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
34683	woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
34684	hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
34685	06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.
34686	She
34687	presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
34688	normal.
34689	Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.
34690	She was admitted to
34691	the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.
34692	Her imaging studies
34693	showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
34694	of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
34695	in addition to a left ICA occlusion.
34696	She was taken to angiogram
34697	for interventional neuroradiology.
34698	She had an angiogram.
34699	Radiology felt they were unable to access the
34700	cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
34701	admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
34702	hypertensive therapy.
34703	She remained stable anti-coagulated on
34704	heparin.
34705	During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
34706	to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
34707	be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
34708	remain anti-coagulated.
34709	She was discharged to rehab and
34710	subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.
34711	At home, she
34712	had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
34713	feeling O.K.
34714	VNA sees her once a week.
34715	At rehab, for unclear
34716	reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
34717	discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
34718	done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
34719	unaware of any such problems.
34720	She continues to get PT and
34721	occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
34722	remains poor.
34723	According to the family member and her daughter
34724	who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
34725	to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
34726	decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
34727	to communicate well with her.
34728	Since her discharge, she has not
34729	had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
34730	changes.
34731	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
34732	chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
34733	claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
34734	heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
34735	diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
34736	rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
34737	or bleeding problems.
34738	Review of neurological systems as above.
34739	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated
34740	cholesterol.
34741	MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.
34742	ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
34743	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son.

34745	FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.
34746	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
34747	rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.
34748	General:  Pleasant woman in
34749	no acute distress.
34750	HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
34751	anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.
34752	There is no thyromegaly.
34753	Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.
34754	Heart:  Regular rate
34755	and rhythm.
34756	Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
34757	Abdomen:  Has good
34758	bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
34759	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
34760	Skin:  No rashes
34761	or ulcers.
34762	Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
34763	interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.
34764	She is attentive.
34765	is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.
34766	She has
34767	decreased naming and decreased comprehension.
34768	She does not have
34769	any neglect or apraxia.
34770	Registration is 3/4.
34771	Short-term memory
34772	is 0/4 in 5 minutes.
34773	Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
34774	Fundi are normal.
34775	Extraocular movements are intact with
34776	nystagmus.
34777	Visual fields are full to confrontation.
34778	She has a
34779	right facial droop.
34780	Facial sensation is intact.
34781	Hearing is
34782	Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
34783	arm and leg.
34784	She has strength on the left is normal.
34785	On the
34786	right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
34787	left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.
34788	reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm.
34789	There is no ataxia on the left.
34790	Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
34791	and so conducts the right leg.
34792	Her reflexes are brisker on the
34793	right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.
34794	IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
34795	acute stroke or hemorrhage.
34796	On the CT, there was a question of a
34797	left MI cutoff.
34798	CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
34799	stenosis with minimal distal interflow.
34800	MRI of the brain showed
34801	a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
34802	the caudate basal ganglia.
34803	She has had mild to moderate chronic
34804	small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.
34805	Echo showed a normal
34806	EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.
34807	IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
34808	vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
34809	with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
34810	infarct.
34811	On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
34812	comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.
34813	It
34814	is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
34815	stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
34816	during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
34817	anti-coagulation therapy.
34818	I have asked her to get a follow up
34819	PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
34820	any contraindications to anti-coagulation.
34821	If there are no such
34822	contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.
34823	In addition,
34824	her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
34825	her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d.
34826	and to maintain a
34827	blood pressure diary.
34828	RECOMMENDATIONS:
34829	1.
34830	Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
34831	t.i.d.
34832	2.
34833	Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
34834	3.
34835	Continue risk factor modification with the management of
34836	blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
34837	4.
34838	PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
34839	stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
34840	per the PCP.
34841	5.
34842	Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
34843	training and language rehab.
34844	6.
34845	Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
34846	problems.
34847	More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
34848	and counseling.

35111	with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
35112	status and urinary incontinence.
35113	Differential diagnosis at this
35114	time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.
35115	patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and
35116	as per review of prior notes.
35117	Repeat stroke is certainly on the
35118	differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a
35119	metabolic or infectious etiology.
35120	The patient will need to have
35121	a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley
35122	catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT
35123	scan.
35124	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency
35125	Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed.
35126	The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
35127	ventricular response.
35128	The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate
35129	of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid
35130	ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the
35131	lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.
35132	No definite
35133	ST segment abnormalities were noted.
35134	The patient then had a
35135	portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable
35136	chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or
35137	findings.
35138	The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and
35139	the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some
35140	right-sided edema.
35141	The patient will have this followed up with
35142	an MRI of the brain.
35143	The patient's laboratory studies were
35144	notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.
35145	The patient's
35146	lactic acid was 1.7.
35147	The patient's white blood cell count was
35148	not elevated.
35149	The patient was not anemic.
35150	urinalysis was consistent with infection.
35151	The patient's first
35152	set of cardiac markers were negative.
35153	The patient's coagulation
35154	studies were normal.
35155	The patient was treated with ceftriaxone
35156	for her urinary tract infection.
35157	The patient could possibly have
35158	urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.
35159	Urine sepsis is my
35160	leading diagnosis at this time.
35161	The patient's right-sided edema
35162	is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient
35163	will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.
35164	The patient
35165	will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.
35166	will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.
35167	The patient's blood
35168	pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient
35169	needs an intensive care unit bed.
35170	In terms the patient's atrial
35171	fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was
35172	given metoprolol IV.
35173	The patient was not given any oral
35174	medications secondary to her possible stroke.
35175	The patient was
35176	given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her
35177	elevated potassium at 5.2.
35178	PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
35179	1.
35180	Urosepsis.
35181	2.
35182	Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
35183	3.
35184	Hyponatremia.
35185	4.
35186	Hyperkalemia.
35187	DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a
35188	monitor bed.
35189	CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.

35384	Lung Transplant Attending Note:
35385	I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.
35386	Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.
35387	The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.
35388	The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.
35389	Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.
35390	Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.
35391	Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.
35392	DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.
35393	Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.
35394	We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.
35395	Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.
35396	Continue maintenance medications for CF.

35813	Date of Visit:  01/20/2120
35814	Bryan returns for followup of cerebrovascular disease.
35815	A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119.
35816	A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA.
35817	He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke.
35818	He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December.
35819	In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo.
35820	His wife called 911.
35821	He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed.
35822	He felt better.
35823	He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly.
35824	An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia.
35825	Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.
35826	He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.
35827	He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet.
35828	He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy.
35829	He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication.
35830	There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms.
35831	Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms.
35832	He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission.
35833	He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.
35834	Lying down he was hypertensive.
35835	He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119.
35836	CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine.
35837	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male.
35838	Blood pressure 160/90 sitting, standing 155/90.
35839	Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia.
35840	Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable.
35841	No bruits.
35842	There are bilateral CEA scars.
35843	Motor examination: No drift.
35844	Power 5/5 throughout.
35845	Fine finger movements intact.
35846	In the lower extremities.
35847	Power 5/5 on the right.
35848	The left he is status post left knee fusion.
35849	The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength.
35850	His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady.
35851	DTRs 1+ throughout.
35852	DATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable.
35853	CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described.
35854	CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA.
35855	Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA.
35856	There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect.
35857	There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.
35858	Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.
35859	Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged.
35860	A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study.
35861	The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis.
35862	Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged.
35863	Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged.
35864	Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study.
35865	New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature.
35866	Followup chest x-ray 11/14/2119 was unremarkable.
35867	Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted.
35868	In 09/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable.
35869	IMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12/2119.
35870	He has been doing well considering.
35871	The cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.
35872	It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology.
35873	He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline.
35874	Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement.
35875	His blood pressure is a little high today.
35876	He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks.
35877	Recommended that he continue to work with Guy on vestibular therapy.
35878	Followup with me in 3 months.

36074	North Andover, KY  41454
36075	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.
36076	The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.
36077	In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.
36078	The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.
36079	There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
36080	The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.
36081	Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.
36082	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.
36083	She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.
36084	MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
36085	She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.
36086	SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.
36087	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.
36088	Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.
36089	The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
36090	Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.
36091	There is no murmur.
36092	The abdomen is soft and nontender.
36093	The liver is not palpably enlarged.
36094	The extremities are warm without edema.
36095	Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.
36096	There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
36097	There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.
36098	Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.
36099	Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.
36100	In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.
36101	Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.
36102	We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.
36103	There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.
36104	Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.
36105	Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.
36106	Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

36191	Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.
36192	After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.
36193	He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.
36194	After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.
36195	MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.
36196	Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.
36197	L shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN).
36198	Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.
36199	He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.
36200	He was started on cefazolin.
36201	Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).
36202	Blood cultures were negative.
36203	He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.
36204	Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.
36205	A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.
36206	He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.
36207	Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.
36208	Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head.
36209	Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.
36210	Mr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.
36211	He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.
36212	No drainage.
36213	Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.
36214	Blood glucoses had been well controlled.
36215	His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.

36221	Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.
36222	Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem.
36223	Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.

36297	Micro Data: 
36298	None recently
36299	Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)
36300	Imaging:
36301	Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.
36302	The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear.
36303	The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease.
36304	There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.
36305	AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.
36306	Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.
36307	With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.
36308	Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.
36309	The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.
36310	He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).
36311	Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.
36312	However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.
36313	As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.
36314	The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.
36315	However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.
36316	This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.
36317	Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).
36318	Recommendations:
36319	-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data
36320	-Aspirate shoulder.
36321	Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures
36322	-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement
36323	-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection
36324	-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement
36325	-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo
36326	Thank you for this interesting consultation.
36327	We will continue to follow with you.

36623	Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 
36624	"History of Present Illness	"
36625	I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM.
36626	BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD
36627	Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it.
36628	The pharmacy didn't give it to her.
36629	Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.
36630	Feels well.
36631	Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.
36632	Denies CP, SOB, palpitations
36633	Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her.
36634	Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.
36635	Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass.
36636	Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI.
36637	She had it done few 9/86.
36638	Recommended to repeat it soon.
36639	Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2.
36640	However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F.

37032	I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.
37033	I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.
37034	Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.
37035	I would only add/emphasize the following:
37036	Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 
37037	h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
37038	Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
37039	Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
37040	Pneumonia several times in the past 
37041	Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
37042	Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
37043	Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
37044	Elevated lipids - on statin 
37045	Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.)
37046	Kidney stones 
37047	Patent foramen ovale
37048	He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.
37049	He has improved with heart rate control.
37050	Exam
37051	VS - as noted
37052	General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.
37053	Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.
37054	CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
37055	Lungs - clear
37056	Abdomen - obese
37057	Extremities - minimal edema
37058	Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.
37059	Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.
37060	Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.
37061	Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.
37062	"I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission."
37063	Recommendations:  
37064	Increase metoprolol dose.
37065	May need Toprol XL 100 BID.
37066	Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.
37067	Filter all IVs (PFO)
37068	PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
37069	Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

37100	Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help.
37101	Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic.
37102	EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec).

37244	Pt was seen last week by Dr.Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna.
37245	I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed Glyburide, Actos and Insulin.
37246	The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  Metformin because of GI intolerance and her regimen was Insulin only.
37247	She did not keep subsequent appointments.
37248	She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis/UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin.
37249	She has now completed the treatment.
37250	She feels better although there is still mild dysuria, denies chills and fever.
