85	History of Present Illness
86	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
87	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
88	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
89	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
90	No variation with food.
91	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
92	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
93	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
94	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).
95	ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail.

152	Lab Test
153	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
154	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
155	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
156	Impression
157	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
158	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
159	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
160	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
161	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
162	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
163	Plan
164	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
165	- check CXR
166	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
167	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
168	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
169	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

182	Dear Dr. Law:
183	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
184	As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
185	His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.
186	Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.
187	He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
188	The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.
189	Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.
190	Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
191	His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.
192	The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.
193	The P-wave is 5.6 mV.
194	The R-wave is 31.3 mV.
195	The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.
196	In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.
197	His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.
198	There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.
199	However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.
200	Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.
201	I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.
202	For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.
203	I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.
204	I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
205	Sincerely,

224	Dear Dr. Gordon:
225	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
226	As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
227	His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.
228	Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.
229	He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
230	The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.
231	We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.
232	He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.
233	However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.
234	He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.
235	Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
236	The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.
237	The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.
238	The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.
239	The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.
240	In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.
241	However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.
242	I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.
243	In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.
244	Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.
245	Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.
246	I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.
247	I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.
248	If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
249	Sincerely,

263	Dear Dr. Swanson:
264	I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.
265	He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.
266	He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.
267	Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.
268	He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.
269	He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.
270	His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.
271	Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.
272	He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
273	We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.
274	He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.
275	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
276	Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

287	Dictated on: 06/14/2138 by URIEL T. ZIRKLE, MD 
288	ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
289	DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.
290	HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133.
291	At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
292	Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans.
293	For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy.
294	A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
295	CT scan was repeated in December of 2137.
296	This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules.
297	Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules.
298	Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer.
299	His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.
300	He has met with Drs.
301	Eagle and Yzaguirre.
302	Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well.
303	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
304	1.
305	Hypertension.
306	2.
307	CVA with residual weakness on the right side.
308	He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.
309	3.
310	High cholesterol.
311	CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.
312	DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.
313	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history.
314	He last smoked in 2132.
315	He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.
316	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.
317	PHYSICAL EXAM:
318	No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
319	No gynecomastia
320	Respiration comfortable
321	Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane.
322	No skeletal deformity or tenderness
323	Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
324	Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
325	No hernias.
326	RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across.
327	He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm.
328	Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.
329	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.
330	Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.
331	For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.
332	Consent obtained today.

357	            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.
358	His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.
359	Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.
360	He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.
361	He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.
362	His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.
363	An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).
364	His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.
365	Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.
366	He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.
367	On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.
368	He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.
369	He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

418	2133: Troponin: 0.05 
419	MICROBIOLOGY
420	8/30 urine cultures: negative
421	RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES
422	1/40: Per cardiology note, echo showed LVEF 60% w/ e/o diastolic dysfunction and ?
423	PFO/ASD
424	8/31/41 CXR
425	: Small left-sided pleural effusion.
426	Patchy atelectasis versus pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
427	EKG
428	a-fib rate 90, normal axis, normal intervals, no TWI 
429	A/P
430	: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia
431	#) Hyperglycemia:
432	 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS.
433	Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ?
434	underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).
435	No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).
436	Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.
437	Current FSBG 330.
438	Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.
439	Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN
440	#) A-fib:
441	 New onset a-fib.
442	Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).
443	CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.
444	Currently rate-controlled 80s.
445	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.
446	Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.
447	On ASA.
448	Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.
449	#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease.
450	Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.
451	#) Edema
452	: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc).
453	Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.
454	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc.
455	w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.
456	Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.
457	#) Bullous pemphigoid
458	: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks.
459	Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.
460	#) HTN
461	: Currently well-controlled.
462	Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily
463	Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.
464	Monitor and add additional agents as needed

466	Will monitor.
467	No current indications for renal replacement therapy.
468	#) 
469	?
470	PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).
471	Will hold antibiotics.
472	#) Gout: cont.
473	allopurinol (redosed for renal function)

1042	"	Reason for visit:"
1043	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up.
1044	Interval History:
1045	   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.
1046	He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.
1047	He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.
1048	At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.
1049	He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.
1050	He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.
1051	His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.
1052	Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.
1053	He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.
1054	He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.
1055	He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.
1056	A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.
1057	The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.
1058	On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.
1059	A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.
1060	Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.
1061	An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.
1062	HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.
1063	His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit.
1064	ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.
1065	He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim.
1066	He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.
1067	With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.
1068	His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA.
1069	He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder.
1070	He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.
1071	Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well.
1072	He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.
1073	He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.
1074	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope.
1075	He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss.
1076	He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.
1077	He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.
1078	The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.
1079	He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.
1080	Past medical history:
1081	   1.
1082	MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis.
1083	Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117.
1084	Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18.

1147	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis.
1148	The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.
1149	At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF.
1150	HE has evidence of severe TR on exam.
1151	From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.
1152	His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.
1153	PLAN:
1154	1.
1155	PVE endocarditis.
1156	He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement.
1157	He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID.
1158	We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today.
1159	He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.
1160	We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
1161	Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.
1162	We will continue his current dose of lasix.
1163	Dry weight ~175-178 lbs.
1164	I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.
1165	We anticipate some recovery of RV function.

1310	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman, new patient who comes in to establish primary care and for followup of multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of foot drop, etc.
1311	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1312	1.
1313	End-stage renal disease.
1314	Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.
1315	She resumed dialysis in 2072.
1316	She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.
1317	She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.
1318	She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.
1319	She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.
1320	Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.
1321	2.
1322	Hypertension.
1323	3.
1324	Peripheral vascular disease.
1325	She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.
1326	She apparently does not have claudication despite this.
1327	4.
1328	History of right foot-drop.
1329	She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.
1330	5.

1335	Secondary hyperparathyroidism.
1336	She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.
1337	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.
1338	She is status post appendectomy.
1339	She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.
1340	MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.

1342	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.
1343	She is a lifetime nonsmoker.
1344	She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.
1345	She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.
1346	She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.
1347	She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.
1348	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
1349	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.
1350	She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.
1351	She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.
1352	She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.
1353	She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.
1354	She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.
1355	She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.
1356	She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.
1357	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.
1358	Her blood pressure is 140/60.
1359	HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
1360	Extraocular movements are intact.
1361	Throat is clear.

1369	End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.
1370	Hypertension, well controlled on medications.
1371	Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.
1372	Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.
1373	Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.
1374	Right foot-drop.
1375	We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.
1376	Left shoulder pain.
1377	It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.
1378	We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.
1379	Hemorrhoids.
1380	8.
1381	Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.
1382	9.
1383	Health maintenance.
1384	Mammogram was done in 06/2086.

1501	EDVISIT^83288425^PAUL, MAE^04/30/90^CORTES, ODESSA
1502	The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Peacock.
1503	Resident's note was reviewed.
1504	The patient was seen and examined
1505	by me.
1506	Please see the resident's note for details of the
1507	patient's past medical, social, family history, review of
1508	systems, and physical exam.
1509	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.
1510	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with
1511	end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with
1512	bleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for
1513	dialysis that started today at dialysis.
1514	When the patient pulled
1515	up her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed.
1516	Blood pressure is 112/60.
1517	The bleeding can be controlled with
1518	compression and so she presented to the Emergency Department
1519	where she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.
1520	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic
1521	stenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and
1522	tricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,
1523	foot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,
1524	secondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery
1525	disease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of
1526	35-40%.
1527	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract
1528	surgery, ovarian cyst removal.
1529	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.
1530	She
1531	is retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.
1532	FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.
1533	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
1534	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital
1535	signs.
1536	She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest
1537	examination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over
1538	the fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would
1539	not controlled with pressure.
1540	LABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.
1541	Chem-7
1542	is otherwise normal.
1543	Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.
1544	Chest x-ray
1545	shows no acute disease.
1546	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair
1547	her fistula.
1548	She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle
1549	nature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her
1550	dialysis appointment and so she is transferred from here with her
1551	daughter to the EHCC Dialysis Unit to undergo full dialysis.
1552	PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding aVF and end-stage renal disease.
1553	DISPOSITION:  She is discharged in satisfactory condition.

2190	Dear Thomas:
2191	  Thank you very much for referring Mr.
2192	Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
2193	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
2194	Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
2195	The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
2196	After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.
2197	It has been progressive over the last several months.
2198	He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
2199	He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.
2200	He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.
2201	Past medical history:
2202	   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.
2203	Hypertension.

2227	There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.
2228	Social history:
2229	   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.
2230	He does not drink alcohol.
2231	He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
2232	Review of systems:
2233	   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
2234	He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
2235	He denies hematochezia.
2236	He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.
2237	He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.

2239	He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
2240	Physical examination:
2241	-Pulse:   55 and regular
2242	-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
2243	-resp.
2244	rate:   12 and unlabored
2245	-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.
2246	Mucous membranes are moist.
2247	Trachea is midline
2248	-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.

2250	Have a normal upstroke.
2251	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
2252	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
2253	He does have low dullness in both bases
2254	-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
2255	He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
2256	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
2257	No organomegaly.
2258	No pulsatile masses
2259	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
2260	He has no pedal edema.
2261	He has no clubbing or cyanosis
2262	Procedures:
2263	Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
2264	His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
2265	Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
2266	He had no chest pain.
2267	Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
2268	The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
2269	EKG:
2270	    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
2271	Selected recent labs:
2272	 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.
2273	Assessment and plan:
2274	   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096.
2275	His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
2276	There are a number of factors involved here.
2277	He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
2278	I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.
2279	He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
2280	He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
2281	He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
2282	He also has low platelets.
2283	The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
2284	It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
2285	He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.
2286	Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
2287	He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
2288	My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
2289	He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
2290	I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.
2291	I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.
2292	Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
2293	Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

2317	RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson
2318	     MR#471-90-84-7
2319	Dear Dr. Geiger:
2320	Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a
2321	preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071.
2322	As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
2323	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
2324	She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and
2325	brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has
2326	increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
2327	she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September
2328	of this year.
2329	In terms of her cardiac history, she was well
2330	until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath
2331	and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart
2332	failure.
2333	At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which
2334	revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to
2335	shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a
2336	dilated left ventricle.
2337	In addition, she had an echo in June of
2338	2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral
2339	regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
2340	She has never been hospitalized since that time for her
2341	congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good
2342	result.
2343	She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or
2344	claudication.
2345	She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
2346	In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her
2347	recollection.
2348	She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house
2349	and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs.
2350	She is
2351	able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty
2352	from chest

2355	pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops
2356	secondary to fatigue.
2357	Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
2358	CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
2359	She has never had
2360	surgery.
2361	Her family history is significant for a mother who died
2362	of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
2363	Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for
2364	40 years and quit four years ago.
2365	She denies alcohol, intravenous
2366	drugs or cocaine use.
2367	She lives with her husband and briefly
2368	worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.
2369	She
2370	has no known drug allergies.
2371	Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril
2372	50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po
2373	QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily
2374	and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.
2375	On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in
2376	her left arm and 165/70 in her right.
2377	Her heart rate was 104 when
2378	I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today.
2379	Her JVP was 7
2380	centimeters.
2381	Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid
2382	bruits.
2383	Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
2384	Her
2385	heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with
2386	occasional ectopic beats.
2387	She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6
2388	systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without
2389	radiation.
2390	Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
2391	extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
2392	Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
2393	She has a
2394	diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin
2395	effects.
2396	She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old
2397	anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
2398	In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
2399	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
2400	with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,
2401	likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial
2402	infarction, although she has never undergone heart
2403	catheterization.
2404	She is currently undergoing evaluation for a
2405	thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
2406	MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071
2407	Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 
2408	given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
2409	since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with
2410	imaging.
2411	If this is similar to her previous study showing only
2412	fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she
2413	will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative
2414	myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is
2415	well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having
2416	Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection
2417	fraction.
2418	She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection
2419	As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation
2420	and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or
2421	rhythm.
2422	Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days
2423	prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after
2424	surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons
2425	as to how may days she should wait after surgery before
2426	restarting that medication.
2427	She will otherwise remain on her
2428	current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and
2429	primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.
2430	If her stress test
2431	is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for
2432	further evaluation.
2433	Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
2434	She was seen
2435	and examined with Dr. Voss.

2450	November 24, 2071
2451	This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 
2452	for management of papillary thyroid cancer.
2453	Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 
2454	when she felt a prominence in her neck.
2455	She did not experience any dysphagia 
2456	or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 
2457	examination.
2458	She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 
2459	hospital.
2460	The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 
2461	cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
2462	She was 
2463	subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 
2464	thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.
2465	The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 
2466	was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 
2467	reimplanted.
2468	According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 
2469	locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.
2470	The 
2471	pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 
2472	lymphovascular invasion.
2473	There was an additional focus of papillary 
2474	carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.
2475	Of 
2476	note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.
2477	The tumor 
2478	did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
2479	Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.
2480	She has been 
2481	maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.
2482	She says that she feels generally 
2483	well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.
2484	She denies any 
2485	changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.
2486	She does endorse a one pound 
2487	weight gain over the last two months.
2488	She denies any paresthesias or other 
2489	symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.
2490	She denies any history of thyroid 
2491	disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.
2492	She is now referred for 
2493	consideration of radioiodine ablation.
2494	Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.
2495	She has an 
2496	ejection fraction of 25%.
2497	She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 
2498	hypertension, and anxiety.
2499	No history of childhood irradiation.
2500	Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 
2501	mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 
2502	captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.
2503	Allergies:No known drug allergies.
2504	Social History:Remote history of tobacco.
2505	She quit 4 years ago.
2506	She 
2507	endorses rare alcohol use.
2508	She is married with four children.
2509	Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.
2510	Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.
2511	Weight 208.
2512	Pulse 
2513	88.
2514	In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 
2515	NAD.
2516	HEENT:  PERRLA.
2517	EOMI.
2518	No proptosis or lid lag.
2519	Neck: supple with a 
2520	large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.
2521	No 
2522	Page 2
2523	remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
2524	Lungs: clear to 
2525	auscultation bilaterally.
2526	Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 
2527	rhythm.
2528	Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.
2529	Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.
2530	Neurologic: reflexes are 
2531	slightly delayed.
2532	There is no tremor of outstretched hands.
2533	Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 
2534	prior to surgery.
2535	Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.
2536	Calcium prior to 
2537	surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 
2538	surgery were in the mid-8 range.
2539	Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 
2540	failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.
2541	Ms. 
2542	Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 
2543	older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 
2544	multifocal disease.
2545	Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.
2546	We suspect that 
2547	she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.
2548	I have recommended 
2549	131I treatment.
2550	Benefits and risks were discussed.
2551	In addition, I think she 
2552	would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.
2553	TSH and calcium were drawn today.
2554	We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

2650	She presents with
2651	episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls.
2652	She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.
2653	She
2654	also had dark stools over the past few weeks.
2655	She denies any
2656	associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any
2657	syncope, any nausea or vomiting.
2658	She does have a bruise on her
2659	chin.
2660	She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.
2661	No
2662	hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.
2663	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial
2664	fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
2665	hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.
2666	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.
2667	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,
2668	otherwise negative.
2669	MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,
2670	and digoxin.
2671	ALLERGIES:  None.
2672	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory
2673	rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air.
2674	General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm
2675	ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left
2676	shoulder.
2677	Her pupils are reactive.
2678	Neck is supple.
2679	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.
2680	Cardiovascular:  Regular
2681	rate.
2682	Abdomen is soft.
2683	Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive
2684	melena per the resident.
2685	Skin is otherwise with bruises over the
2686	left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears
2687	healing.
2688	Extremities are with good range of motion.
2689	No focal
2690	tenderness.
2691	She is oriented x3.
2692	Mood and affect are normal.
2693	She is moving all extremities equally.
2694	LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal
2695	process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial
2696	abnormalities.
2697	Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit
2698	of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and
2699	platelets of 358.
2700	INR of 2.
2701	Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no
2702	blood.
2703	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents
2704	with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent
2705	falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process
2706	such as a subdural or stroke.
2707	This has been going on for several
2708	weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past
2709	several weeks and profound anemia for which she required
2710	transfusion in the Emergency Department.
2711	We did order a CT of
2712	the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both
2713	given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.
2714	This
2715	does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.
2716	She is quite
2717	anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.
2718	I suspect this is the
2719	etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and
2720	concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could
2721	represent coronary insufficiency.
2722	She does not have an elevated
2723	troponin at present.
2724	She will need to be further monitored.
2725	was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her
2726	profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.
2727	Clinically, feels better.
2728	I discussed with the patient's family
2729	because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____
2730	further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as
2731	physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical
2732	issues have been addressed.
2733	She will be admitted to the medical
2734	service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal
2735	bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in
2736	stable condition.

3009	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
3010	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
3011	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
3012	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
3013	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
3014	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
3015	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
3016	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
3017	He never developed chest pain.
3018	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
3019	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
3020	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
3021	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
3022	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
3023	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
3024	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
3025	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
3026	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
3027	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
3028	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
3029	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
3030	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
3031	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.
3032	He denies any calf pain.

3474	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
3475	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.
3476	Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.
3477	TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).
3478	DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).
3479	The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.
3480	Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.
3481	She is currently CP free.
3482	1.
3483	Chest pain
3484	-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now
3485	-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.
3486	Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
3487	-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult
3488	-     TTE in AM
3489	-     Check amylase, lipase 
3490	-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM
3491	-     Smoking cessation consult
3492	2.
3493	Lupus-like condition
3494	-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM
3495	3.
3496	DM
3497	-     Check HbA1c
3498	-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS

3746	PROBLEMS:
3747	1.
3748	Acute coronary syndrome.
3749	She was in New York and experienced chest pain.
3750	She was seen at Conway Hospital where she underwent placement of two stents in the right coronary artery.
3751	EKG changes suggest IMI.
3752	She was told that she would need further intervention, but comes with no paperwork.

3759	Please see prior notes for full lipid analysis, but LDL was 221.
3760	She has been on Zocor.
3761	4.
3762	Mitral valve disease.
3763	Prior to recent coronary event, she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient.
3764	There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and leaflet as well as the subvalvular apparatus with an echo dense mobile structure and trigger aspect suggesting a partially disrupted chordae.
3765	MEDICATIONS:  
3766	Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
3767	daily.
3768	Plavix 75 mg p.o.

3770	Zocor 20 mg p.o.
3771	nightly though given a prescription for Lipitor 80 mg nightly in New York.
3772	5.
3773	Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
3774	6.
3775	Metformin 500 mg daily.
3776	7.
3777	Norvasc 10 mg daily.
3778	8.
3779	Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg p.r.n.
3780	REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.
3781	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.
3782	Blood pressure 120/88, weight 213 pounds, and temperature 97.8.
3783	Chest clear to percussion and auscultation.
3784	Cardiac exam; no extra sounds.
3785	Rather coarse near holosystolic murmur.
3786	No apprecialble 2nd or third compenents.
3787	No pedal edema.
3788	EKG today:  Heart rate was 54 and regular with normal intervals.
3789	She has a Q-wave in III and F and slight reversal of R-wave progression in right precordium.
3790	These are distinct change from EKG done one month ago.
3791	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
3792	Status post IMI.
3793	Not on beta-blocker and I will not initiate given sinus bradycardia.
3794	I have arranged for her to be seen in Cardiology to determine best next steps.
3795	I tried to contact the cardiologist who took care of her in Conway Hospital whose phone number is 674-449-3338.
3796	Good control.
3797	Will initiate therapy with Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
3798	nightly for this and problem 1 above.
3799	Prior authorization form completed.

3814	Dear Dr. Barron:
3815	Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
3816	I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
3817	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
3818	Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
3819	It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
3820	On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
3821	She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
3822	I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
3823	Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
3824	Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
3825	Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.
3826	She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
3827	Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
3828	She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
3829	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.
3830	Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.
3831	She has no known drug allergies.
3832	Social History:  She is married and has three children.
3833	She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
3834	Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
3835	She has never used tobacco.
3836	Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
3837	There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
3838	Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
3839	Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
3840	All others are negative.
3841	On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
3842	Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
3843	Her weight is 213 pounds.
3844	Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
3845	There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
3846	The carotid upstrokes are full.
3847	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
3848	The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
3849	The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
3850	The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.
3851	Her extremities show no edema.
3852	Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
3853	She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
3854	I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
3855	On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.
3856	She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
3857	She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
3858	There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
3859	She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
3860	In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
3861	She did receive drug-eluting stents.
3862	The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
3863	What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
3864	From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
3865	She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
3866	I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
3867	To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
3868	We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
3869	In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
3870	The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
3871	In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.
3872	Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
3873	After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
3874	However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
3875	She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.
3876	The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.
3877	This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
3878	I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
3879	Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
3880	If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

3934	NAME:     Upham, Zelda
3935	MRN:      9656797
3936	Patient is here for a follow-up.
3937	Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.
3938	Says
3939	that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people
3940	for transportation.
3941	Still has severe right shoulder pain.
3942	Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is
3943	worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.
3944	Reviewed x-rays, which were
3945	negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in
3946	the TMJ area.
3947	Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this
3948	shoulder pain.
3949	Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she
3950	could not take it with ibuprofen.
3951	I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in
3952	place of the ibuprofen and she understands.
3953	Is not willing to try Flexeril.
3954	Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult
3955	interactions with her children.
3956	Has not asked for more Valium.
3957	Has never been
3958	interested in counseling prior to today.
3959	Did not become tearful like she has in the
3960	past.
3961	Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.
3962	Prescription apparently was given to her
3963	last spring.
3964	Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.
3965	No clear to me what
3966	causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves
3967	her symptoms.
3968	I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain
3969	that is reproducible when she touches her chest.
3970	The patient seems to label her chest
3971	wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.
3972	PROBLEMS: As per LMR.
3973	MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.
3974	ALLERGIES: As per LMR.
3975	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD.
3976	Blood pressure 150/80.
3977	Pulse 80 and regular.
3978	Weight 152 pounds.
3979	Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds.
3980	COR: RRR.
3981	S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.
3982	Extremities: No lower extremity
3983	edema.
3984	Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.
3985	Full range of motion of
3986	shoulders.
3987	No tenderness over AC joints.
3988	Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect
3989	of sternum and its border on left.
3990	No masses or deformity noted.
3991	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
3992	(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter
3993	     Mccarthy.
3994	Referral done.
3995	Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.
3996	(2)  Elevated blood pressure.
3997	Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated.
3998	At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.
3999	Think she may need
4000	     this at future visit.
4001	Will also refer back to her cardiologist.
4002	(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year.
4003	Several medications that patient appears
4004	     to be sensitive to side effects.
4005	At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting
4006	     profile.
4007	Positive checkup.
4008	Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.
4009	(4)  Leg cramps.
4010	Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25
4011	     years of leg cramps.
4012	Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction.
4013	Patient already takes Valium p.r.n.
4014	and I am reluctant to start any other
4015	     anxiolytics.
4016	Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit.
4017	(5)  History of sciatica.
4018	Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection
4019	     for her lower back pain, which resolved.
4020	Will simply follow with Vioxx, which
4021	     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.
4022	Also continue with
4023	     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and
4024	     chronic low back pain.
4025	Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks.
4026	ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell
4027	me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

4035	NOTE
4036	     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.
4037	She is now 52 and
4038	has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
4039	OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.
4040	She
4041	had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
4042	well since that time.
4043	Over the past year she has not been as
4044	careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
4045	sugars regularly.
4046	A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
4047	300.
4048	She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
4049	anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
4050	diaphoresis or light-headedness.
4051	There has not been any reduction
4052	in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
4053	ago and is working full-time.
4054	There has been no orthopnea, PND or
4055	peripheral edema.
4056	She is interested in increasing her physical
4057	activity program.
4058	Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
4059	20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
4060	developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.
4061	She is
4062	perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
4063	gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
4064	Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
4065	EXAM
4066	     She is comfortable at rest.
4067	BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.
4068	No
4069	JVD.
4070	Carotids full w/o bruits.
4071	Chest clr.
4072	Cardiac exam shows
4073	normal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.
4074	Abd.
4075	soft w/o
4076	organomegaly.
4077	No peripheral edema.
4078	Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
4079	and is a normal tracing.
4080	For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
4081	gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
4082	using the standard bruce protocol.
4083	She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
4084	seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
4085	chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.
4086	Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
4087	maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure.
4088	There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
4089	load.
4090	Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
4091	seconds longer.
4092	IMPRESSION
4093	     1.
4094	No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time.
4095	She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
4096	hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
4097	perimenopausal state.
4098	She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
4099	her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
4100	profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
4101	PAGE 2
4102	instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.
4103	From a cardiac
4104	standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.
4105	Low
4106	dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
4107	I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
4108	evaluation as needed in the future.

4339	Studies
4340	EKG-NSR, dynamic t-wave changes anterior, ~1mm ST elevation worse than prior v4-v5
4341	CXR:  Vascular congestion.
4342	Impression and Plan:  58 year old man with PVD, likely CAD but no available ischemic work-up.
4343	Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load.
4344	There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations.
4345	No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand.
4346	Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place.
4347	As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.
4348	Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR).
4349	Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation.
4350	Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues
4351	Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI.
4352	Follow markers.
4353	Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.
4354	Have request FMC records.
4355	Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath.
4356	Heparin, 
4357	Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP
4358	Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.

4438	Ms. Quijano is a 61 yo morbidly obese woman with CAD, OA, and CHF who is in for follow-up of these problems.
4439	"History of Present Illness	"
4440	She is working every day and feels much better than she did last year.
4441	She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.
4442	Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.
4443	She has had no chest pain.
4444	She does not complain of SOB.
4445	She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.
4446	She also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.
4447	She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.
4448	In addition, she complains of some food intolerance.
4449	She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.
4450	After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.
4451	She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.
4452	Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.

4567	RE:  Gerald, Marion 
4568	MRN: 48967301 
4569	DOV: 05/18/83
4570	Dear Dr. Olive,
4571	Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.
4572	She is 
4573	referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.
4574	The patient states she is 
4575	currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 
4576	developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.
4577	This continued to bother her 
4578	and she eventually was treated with steroids.
4579	I am not sure she had a 
4580	diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.
4581	She then was switched to ibuprofen which 
4582	did not work particularly well.
4583	Over this time, she would have intermittent 
4584	episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 
4585	her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.
4586	She was seen by 
4587	Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 
4588	"she had ""25 shots"" of steroids."
4589	She denies any hot or swollen joints.
4590	She 
4591	has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.
4592	Extensive ROS reveals 
4593	no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.
4594	has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 
4595	well.
4596	She has continued to be concerned about that.
4597	She has had fevers or 
4598	chills but no temperature elevation.
4599	She has intermittent abdominal pain but 
4600	has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.
4601	She has 
4602	morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.
4603	Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.
4604	Mother is 
4605	85.
4606	Two sons alive and well.
4607	Two siblings alive and well except for 
4608	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
4609	Past medical history is pertinent for above.
4610	She has had a partial 
4611	hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.
4612	Medications 
4613	include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 
4614	metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 
4615	q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.
4616	No smoking or drinking history.
4617	No allergies.
4618	No other medical problems.
4619	Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.
4620	She works as a 
4621	midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.
4622	Her husband is 
4623	a Broadcast Technician.
4624	They have traveled quite a bit because of this.
4625	Page 2
4626	Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.
4627	Weight 152.
4628	BP 
4629	120/80.
4630	She had a respiratory rate of 16.
4631	She had full range of motion of 
4632	all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 
4633	cervical and lumbar area.
4634	Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.
4635	No oral ulcerations.
4636	Good salivary pool.
4637	No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 
4638	or axillary adenopathy.
4639	Chest: clear to A&P.
4640	No carotid bruits.
4641	Vascular 
4642	exam: normal.
4643	Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.
4644	Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
4645	Extremities: without 
4646	edema.
4647	I suspect she has fibromyalgia.
4648	I do not really know the place of steroids 
4649	in this setting.
4650	I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 
4651	CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.
4652	I will see her back in four 
4653	to six weeks.
4654	She will get old records for me to review.
4655	We will talk about 
4656	what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 
4657	have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.
4658	I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.
4659	Sincerely yours,

4676	Dear Dr. Higgins,
4677	Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary
4678	care.
4679	I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.
4680	She
4681	comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.
4682	Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.
4683	She has
4684	been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what
4685	she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had
4686	planned.
4687	However, she has other medical problems which I will
4688	deal with until she sees you.
4689	At her last visit, there was a
4690	"question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not"
4691	given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.
4692	However,
4693	she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,
4694	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include
4695	metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20
4696	q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.
4697	Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces
4698	her pain.
4699	She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
4700	HEENT
4701	was otherwise unremarkable.
4702	I obtained blood studies which
4703	revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62
4704	and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8
4705	with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of
4706	14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.
4707	A1c
4708	pending.
4709	A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did
4710	not reveal proteinuria or sediment.
4711	HBsAG and HCV are pending as
4712	well.
4713	I will be in touch with her regarding these results.
4714	I was
4715	wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of
4716	these abnormalities outlined.
4717	Thanks for letting me participate
4718	in her care.
4719	Sincerely yours,

4732	(449) 515-0294
4733	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest
4734	pain.
4735	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient
4736	with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,
4737	hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous
4738	doctor, Yesenia Olive.
4739	The following issues addressed:
4740	1.
4741	Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any
4742	symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.
4743	Maintained on Glucophage
4744	1000 mg b.i.d.
4745	Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day
4746	is around 120.
4747	We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.
4748	Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.
4749	2.
4750	Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will
4751	be less than a 100.
4752	She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day
4753	and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256.
4754	We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.
4755	3.
4756	Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is
4757	acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.
4758	4.
4759	Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood
4760	pressure is currently acceptable.
4761	5.
4762	Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation
4763	rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in
4764	the past.
4765	No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a
4766	history of recent chest pain.
4767	6.
4768	Exercise-induced chest pain.
4769	The patient has noted over the
4770	past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest
4771	when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.
4772	This
4773	subsides when she stops and rests for a while.
4774	This has been
4775	reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her
4776	husband.
4777	Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had
4778	thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted
4779	heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.
4780	EKG showed 1 mm ST
4781	depression in leads II and V4 through 6.
4782	The thallium scan
4783	showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior
4784	walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending
4785	artery distribution.
4786	She does not recall having symptoms at that
4787	time.
4788	Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with
4789	chest discomfort.
4790	There are some radiation into both shoulders
4791	and neck.
4792	Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,
4793	diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.
4794	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,
4795	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro
4796	150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d.
4797	and Glucophage 500 mg two
4798	tabs b.i.d.
4799	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
4800	SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.
4801	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel
4802	habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.
4803	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.
4804	Temperature
4805	of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.
4806	Pupils are equal,
4807	round and reactive.
4808	Conjunctivae clear.
4809	Sclerae anicteric.
4810	Oropharynx benign.
4811	Neck is supple.
4812	No neck vein distention.
4813	Thyroid is not palpable.
4814	Chest is clear to percussion and
4815	auscultation.
4816	Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,
4817	thrill or gallop.
4818	Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds
4819	and no organomegaly.
4820	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or
4821	edema.
4822	Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
4823	No
4824	abnormal complex.
4825	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
4826	Diabetes.
4827	We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she
4828	has had an ophthalmologic follow up.
4829	Maintain Glucophage.
4830	Elevated cholesterol.
4831	Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.
4832	Chest pain.
4833	Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.
4834	I have
4835	contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an
4836	ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.
4837	I prescribed nitroglycerin
4838	1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes.
4839	x 3 for chest
4840	discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.
4841	Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add
4842	beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing
4843	heart block.
4844	Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current
4845	Levoxyl.
4846	The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and
4847	cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

4860	(449) 515-0294
4861	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.
4862	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
4863	1.
4864	The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in
4865	today having just had a stress test.
4866	Stress test showed that she
4867	was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds
4868	achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,
4869	stopped for fatigue.
4870	Immediately after exercise, she did have
4871	some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.
4872	There were no EKG changes.
4873	The patient reports that she has been
4874	walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise
4875	level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had
4876	precipitated the hospitalization initially.
4877	She is looking into
4878	cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.
4879	She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.
4880	She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a
4881	healthy lifestyle.
4882	She has returned to work.
4883	She has follow up
4884	scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.
4885	2.
4886	Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her
4887	Glucophage 2000 mg a day.
4888	She monitors blood sugars but only in
4889	the morning.
4890	Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.
4891	However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically
4892	sweating and abdominal discomfort.
4893	She has never actually
4894	checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to
4895	occur at work.
4896	She has not had any fainting or dizziness.
4897	3.
4898	Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.
4899	4.
4900	Hypertension.
4901	At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose
4902	because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and
4903	currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.

4910	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness
4911	of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
4912	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in
4913	good spirits.
4914	Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is

4927	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
4928	Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty
4929	with stenting.
4930	Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.
4931	At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac
4932	rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.
4933	Diabetes, seems as though her control is 
4934	impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.
4935	We will
4936	discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.
4937	Elevated cholesterol.

5023	Record date: 2094-04-03
5024	NAME:    Yager, Becky 
5025	MRN:     0887181
5026	Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
5027	A lot has happened since she
5028	was seen.
5029	She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.
5030	She
5031	therefore has been having financial problems.
5032	She does not have enough money to
5033	buy her medications.
5034	She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
5035	She has not taken these medications for months.
5036	She states she has been taking her
5037	nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.
5038	When I called her from
5039	the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
5040	she fell.
5041	We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
5042	taken.
5043	She reports being off balance for about the past month.
5044	She has been feeling
5045	more unsteady on her feet.
5046	She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
5047	to falling.
5048	She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
5049	mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.
5050	On review of other systems, she
5051	reports a 20 lb.
5052	weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
5053	working and being at home and eating more than usual.
5054	She also notes that she has
5055	begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.
5056	She complains of excessive
5057	dry mouth.
5058	She reports being more thirsty than usual.
5059	PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.
5060	She is alert and
5061	oriented X 3.
5062	Speech fluent without aphasia.
5063	BP sitting 145/70.
5064	Pulse 80.
5065	Standing
5066	BP unchanged at 145/70.
5067	Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
5068	bilateral nystagmus.
5069	Otherwise intact.
5070	On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
5071	movements.
5072	No drift.
5073	Good power throughout.
5074	Fine finger movements intact.
5075	Vibratory loss to the ankles.
5076	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
5077	When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
5078	was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.
5079	IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
5080	medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed.
5081	Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.
5082	Her
5083	exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.
5084	Therefore I suspect toxic
5085	metabolic cause.
5086	As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
5087	screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.
5088	I will be
5089	in touch with the physicians after they see her.

5239	RADIOLOGY
5240	Chest CT:  4/11/96
5241	"	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to"
5242	"	suggest pulmonary embolism."
5243	There are several mediastinal lymph
5244	"	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size."
5245	However, in the
5246	"	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes"
5247	"	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis."
5248	These could be
5249	"	reactive or neoplastic."
5250	There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
5251	"	node."
5252	In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
5253	"	parenchymal nodule."
5254	This is best demonstrated on image 65.
5255	This
5256	"	could possibly represent a malignancy."
5257	Alternatively this could
5258	"	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node."
5259	This does not appear to
5260	"	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less"
5261	"	likely."
5262	Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
5263	"	right lung base."
5264	There is no pneumothorax.
5265	No significant
5266	"	pleural fluid is noted."
5267	There is no pericardial fluid.
5268	IMPRESSION:
5269	"	No pulmonary embolism or DVT."
5270	There are multiple mediastinal
5271	"	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe."
5272	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
5273	A follow-up chest CT may be further
5274	"	value."
5275	These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time
5276	"	of dictation."
5277	EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.
5278	A/P:
5279	Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.
5280	This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.
5281	I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.
5282	Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5283	CV:
5284	--Rate:  well controlled without medication.
5285	--Rhythm:  normal sinus

5288	Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.
5289	Will obtain stress test in AM.
5290	PULM:  
5291	--plant PPD
5292	--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.
5293	--send ANCA
5294	--follow up CT for nodule
5295	--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing

5449	male with known CAD.
5450	He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
5451	At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
5452	He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
5453	He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
5454	He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA.
5455	His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
5456	He was referred for surgery.
5457	He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.
5458	He now presents with recurrent chest burning.
5459	He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG.
5460	His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest.
5461	He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis.
5462	During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test.
5463	Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds.
5464	He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved.
5465	MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility.
5466	There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct.
5467	His ejection fraction is 46%.
5468	He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.

5938	1.
5939	Normal left ventricular size with moderate concentric left ventricular
5940	   hypertrophy.
5941	Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated
5942	   ejection fraction of 42%.
5943	There is severe anterior and anteroseptal
5944	   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.
5945	No left ventricular thombus is
5946	   detected.
5947	Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.
5948	Borderline left atrial enlargement.
5949	Normal right atrial size.

6134	CXR: Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema.
6135	The findings
6136	"	are more prominent then the prior study from 4/27/73 x-ray."
6137	EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18
6138	Impression: 
6139	55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity.
6140	His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits.
6141	The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy.
6142	He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.
6143	Recommendations: 
6144	-   check UA, NH3
6145	-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g.
6146	with Labetalol.
6147	-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.
6148	-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity
6149	-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy
6150	This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 
6151	Thank you for this interesting consult.

6300	"	Reason for visit:"
6301	   consulted by Dr Dunham for continuity of care s/p cabg
6302	"	Interval History:"
6303	   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham.
6304	Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.
6305	He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance.
6306	Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees.
6307	He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI.
6308	There was global hypokinesis.
6309	Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076).
6310	There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance.
6311	He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss.
6312	His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved.
6313	He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty.
6314	Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB.

6397	RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594
6398	Dear Dr. Vanpelt,
6399	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 
6400	recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
6401	I followed him in the hospital 
6402	when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.
6403	As you know, he is a 77 
6404	year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 
6405	hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 
6406	lower extremity bypasses in the past.
6407	He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 
6408	for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.
6409	His preoperative evaluation 
6410	included 
6411	a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 
6412	induced 
6413	hypokinesis in the inferior wall.
6414	Since this was a small area, it was felt 
6415	he 
6416	could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.
6417	He 
6418	underwent 
6419	left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 
6420	with 
6421	no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
6422	However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
6423	35 and a troponin of 19.5.
6424	As a result of his large troponin leak, he 
6425	underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 
6426	main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 
6427	artery, 
6428	100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 
6429	posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 
6430	PDA.
6431	Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 
6432	45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.
6433	Due to 
6434	his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 
6435	on 
6436	Apr 20, 2091.
6437	He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 
6438	graft to his obtuse marginal artery.
6439	He did not have a graft to his 
6440	posterior 
6441	descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary 
6442	Nicholas-Xaviar, Fred
6443	MR #65856594
6444	Page Two
6445	to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.
6446	Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 
6447	April 
6448	27, 2091.
6449	His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 
6450	Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 
6451	morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
6452	and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.
6453	Since that time, he has done quite well.
6454	He has been progressing at 
6455	rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 
6456	per 
6457	day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 
6458	his house.
6459	He denies any chest pain with walking.
6460	He has no shortness of 
6461	breath or dyspnea on exertion.
6462	He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 
6463	long 
6464	time and this is unchanged.
6465	He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 
6466	claudication symptoms with walking at this time.
6467	He does complain of some 
6468	pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation.
6469	has 
6470	plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.
6471	On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 
6472	60.
6473	His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 
6474	without carotid bruits.
6475	His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 
6476	bilaterally.
6477	His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 
6478	rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.
6479	His 
6480	chest 
6481	incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well.
6482	has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 
6483	well.
6484	There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 
6485	does not appear to be cellulitic.
6486	His feet are warm.
6487	His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 
6488	in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 
6489	unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.
6490	In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 
6491	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 
6492	disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 
6493	three 
6494	weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.
6495	will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 
6496	time.
6497	I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 
6498	and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.
6499	I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 
6500	his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.
6501	I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 
6502	regimen so I have changed his 
6503	Page Three
6504	Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d.
6505	and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o.
6506	q.d..
6507	He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 
6508	develops 
6509	any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 
6510	concerns.
6511	He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.
6512	Thank you for 
6513	allowing me to participate in his care.
6514	Sincerely,

6916	Dear Dr. Truong:
6917	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
6918	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
6919	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
6920	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
6921	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
6922	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
6923	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
6924	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
6925	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
6926	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
6927	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
6928	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
6929	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
6930	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
6931	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
6932	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
6933	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
6934	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
6935	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
6936	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.
6937	Sincerely,

7009	Dear Bethany: 
7010	I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.
7011	Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.
7012	Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.
7013	Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.
7014	She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.
7015	She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.
7016	After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.
7017	At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.
7018	When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.
7019	She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.
7020	She has not had palpitations.
7021	She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.
7022	She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits.
7023	She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.
7024	She has not had any peripheral numbness.
7025	The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.
7026	The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner.
7027	On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.
7028	The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.
7029	Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.
7030	She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.
7031	The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.
7032	She is fully alert.
7033	The neck veins are not elevated.
7034	The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.
7035	There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.
7036	The lungs are clear.
7037	The PMI is not displaced.
7038	There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.
7039	The abdomen is benign.
7040	There is no renal artery bruit.
7041	The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.
7042	There is no tenderness of her skin.
7043	The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening.
7044	Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.
7045	The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.
7046	However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.
7047	Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.
7048	I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.
7049	Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.
7050	I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.
7051	We are pleased with the present regimen.
7052	We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.
7053	We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.
7054	I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.
7055	Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.
7056	I know that you will continue to follow her closely.
7057	I told her that I would see her again in nine months.
7058	Sincerely,
7059	______________________________

7201	CXR: Clear.
7202	CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
7203	TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.
7204	A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.
7205	Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.
7206	It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.
7207	However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.
7208	Ischemic event is less likely in this man.
7209	EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.
7210	Other possible causes include:
7211	"  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently."
7212	However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.
7213	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.
7214	Plan:
7215	"1)	Continue hydration overnight."
7216	2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.
7217	3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.
7218	4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.
7219	5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.
7220	DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.
7221	Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.
7222	Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.
7223	"1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI."
7224	2)     Q6h finger stick check.
7225	3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.
7226	L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.
7227	Tender to palpation and with joint movement.
7228	No signs of infection.
7229	Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.
7230	"1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture."
7231	2)     PT consult.
7232	FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).
7233	Eating PO.
7234	On IVF for hydration.
7235	"1)	Replete Mg.  "
7236	2)     K now 3.6.
7237	If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.
7238	3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.
7239	Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin.
7240	Dispo: PT consult.

7249	"MR#: 	902-15-55"
7250	Date of Admission: 10/10/92
7251	"Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula"
7252	PCP: Estep, Willa
7253	Code status: Full
7254	CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis
7255	HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.
7256	He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.
7257	He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.
7258	He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.
7259	He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.
7260	He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.
7261	When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.
7262	One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.
7263	Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.
7264	As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.
7265	According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.
7266	He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.
7267	He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.
7268	Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.
7269	At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.
7270	In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.
7271	He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.
7272	He has had no other symptoms.
7273	Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.
7274	He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.
7275	Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.
7276	"PMH: 	- DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only."

7383	_____________________________________________________________________________________
7384	Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.
7385	Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.
7386	No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.
7387	No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.
7388	Stable Hct.
7389	Likely etiologies include:
7390	1.
7391	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.
7392	EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.
7393	Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.
7394	Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.
7395	2.
7396	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.
7397	Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.
7398	3.
7399	Prazosin-induced hypotension.
7400	In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.
7401	4.
7402	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.
7403	Plan:
7404	"Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers"
7405	"		- Telemetry"
7406	"		- 24 hr Holter monitor"
7407	"		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler"
7408	"		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m."
7409	"		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr"
7410	"		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient"
7411	"		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd"
7412	"DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m."
7413	"		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet"
7414	"OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN"
7415	"Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol"
7416	"Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc."

7609	ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     
7610	Chest xray: Clear
7611	Assessment & Plan
7612	83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting.
7613	Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features.
7614	However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain.
7615	Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s.
7616	However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion.
7617	It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.
7618	There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.
7619	Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
7620	Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
7621	Has completed MI r/o
7622	Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
7623	Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
7624	CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
7625	Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
7626	RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
7627	Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.
7628	Afebrile.
7629	Hemodynamically stable.
7630	U/A and chest xray negative
7631	Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
7632	Fen/Renal
7633	Replete Mg
7634	Proph: Lovenox, nexium

7815	"	Interval History:"
7816	   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.
7817	The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.
7818	He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.
7819	The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
7820	Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.
7821	The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.
7822	Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).
7823	The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
7824	An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.
7825	The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.

8001	Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.
8002	Assessment and plan:
8003	   ASSESSMENT:
8004	63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).
8005	In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.
8006	The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.
8007	PLAN:
8008	Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).
8009	Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.
8010	No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.
8011	Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.
8012	Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.
8013	Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.
8014	Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.
8015	Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.
8016	Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.
8017	Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.
8018	Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.
8019	Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.
8020	Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

8052	Interval History:
8053	   Patient is a 63-year-old with long-standing right-greater-than-left claudication 
8054	The Fall of 77, he could only walk about 25 feet before experiencing 
8055	pain.
8056	Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24.
8057	An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses.
8058	He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left.
8059	10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI.
8060	A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%.
8061	He has been treated medically without any further angina.
8062	.
8063	11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal.
8064	The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent.
8065	6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal.
8066	The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA 
8067	Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief.
8068	In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain.
8069	He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise.
8070	A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds.
8071	"He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because "" his legs gave out""."
8072	Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK.
8073	Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped.
8074	He was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography.
8075	Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath).
8076	Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk.
8077	He arrived on Cardio.

8186	male who presented to Dr Barton's office on 6/18/79  with left foot pain with claudication at approximately 20 feet, L&gt;R, and constant left great toe pain.
8187	He has intermittent b/l buttock.
8188	Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today.
8189	He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which resolves with ambulation.
8190	He does not exercise but is active during the day.
8191	He also c/o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded.
8192	He was resting at the time.
8193	He took sl TNG without any improvement.
8194	This has occured 2-3 times.
8195	He denies sob, n/v, diaphoresis, syncope.
8196	CTA RUN on 6/03/79 showed multilevel disease involving both SFAs.
8197	Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR.
8198	Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal in-stent stenosis within the distal stent.
8199	One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries.
8200	AVF in the right groin.
8201	An Adenosine MIBI was performed on 6/03/79.
8202	"Exercised with arm exercises for  4' 0"", reaching 62% of MPHR."
8203	EKG negative for ischemia.
8204	Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia, EF 46%.
8205	Compared to 10/78 (done w/ exercise as opposed to adenosine) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar 49%.
8206	Today he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath.
8207	Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent.
8208	Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent.
8209	Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a 30% diffuse narrowing.

8507	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access
8508	initiated.
8509	He was placed on a cardiac monitor.
8510	EKG was
8511	performed.
8512	He received 1 time sublingual nitroglycerin with a
8513	drop in his blood pressure to systolic in the high 70s.
8514	A second
8515	IV was placed.
8516	Right-sided EKG leads were performed, and the
8517	patient received IV fluid bolus.
8518	He had already received
8519	aspirin.
8520	His white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 41, and
8521	platelets 175,000.

8527	sinus rhythm in the 80s with a normal axis, normal intervals.
8528	His pseudonormalization noted only in lead III.
8529	He has
8530	approximately 1.5 mm ST depression with normal ST segments in the
8531	anteroseptal leads with somewhat hyperacute appearing T waves.
8532	Right-sided leads show some mild, less than 1-mm, ST upward
8533	sloping in V2 through V5.
8534	He had a chest x-ray performed that
8535	showed a normal mediastinum and some mild fluffy alveolar
8536	infiltrates in the bases but no obvious consolidation and no
8537	significant cephalization.
8538	He had blood pressures checked in
8539	both arms once his blood pressure improved after an IV fluid
8540	bolus and was noted to have a persistent 20 point difference in
8541	systolic blood pressures of 136/65 on the right and 111/65 on the
8542	left.
8543	When the patient was questioned about this, he states that
8544	he has had that noted in his doctor's office in the past.
8545	He
8546	underwent CT scanning of the chest, which ruled out aortic
8547	dissection after discussion with the attending radiologist.
8548	As
8549	his blood pressure stabilized, he received IV Lopressor and
8550	became pain free.
8551	He did not require any further nitroglycerin.
8552	Repeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the 0.5 mm ST
8553	depression in the anterior leads.
8554	Given the patient's cardiac
8555	risk factor and his history, which is fairly worrisome for
8556	 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
8557	with a diagnosis of chest pain, rule out new-onset angina.
8558	does remain pain free now and has maintained a stable blood
8559	pressure after IV fluid bolus.
8560	See the note for full details.
8561	Critical care time was 45 minutes.

8618	Dear Kenneth: 
8619	Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention.
8620	He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.
8621	At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.
8622	He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.
8623	He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.
8624	MEDICATIONS:
8625	1.
8626	Aspirin 325 mg daily.
8627	2.
8628	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
8629	3.
8630	Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
8631	4.
8632	Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
8633	5.
8634	Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
8635	6.
8636	Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.
8637	INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:
8638	Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.
8639	Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.
8640	On examination, he is comfortable at rest.
8641	The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.
8642	The jugular venous pressure is 5.
8643	The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.
8644	The chest is clear.
8645	Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.
8646	The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.
8647	There is no peripheral pitting edema.
8648	The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.
8649	In summary, Mr. Lara has:
8650	History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.
8651	Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.
8652	Hypertension, not controlled.
8653	His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.
8654	We spoke about the options.
8655	As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.
8656	He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.
8657	To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.
8658	"A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly."
8659	Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.
8660	[Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms.
8661	Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines.
8662	He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.
8663	He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]
8664	Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.
8665	When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.
8666	A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.
8667	Mild mitral regurgitation.
8668	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.
8669	With kind regards, sincerely yours,

8925	      DOB: 08/02/2095
8926	Dear Dr. Calhoun;
8927	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
8928	As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck.
8929	We.
8930	started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
8931	In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
8932	We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
8933	He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.
8934	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
8935	1.
8936	Osteoporosis.
8937	2.
8938	Hypogonadism.

8955	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.
8956	MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day.
8957	ALLERGIES: Tape.
8958	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.
8959	Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds.
8960	Height 5 feet 4 inches.
8961	LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171.
8962	His hematocrit is 39.
8963	It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000.
8964	White count 4.8.
8965	In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer.
8966	The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
8967	I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
8968	He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.
8969	We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
8970	Please let me know if you have any questions.
8971	Yours sincerely,

8984	RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE
8985	HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75
8986	REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.
8987	DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173
8988	REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).
8989	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.
8990	He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.
8991	This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.
8992	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.
8993	He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.
8994	While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.
8995	He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.
8996	In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.
8997	On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
8998	On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.
8999	On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.
9000	Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.
9001	On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.
9002	He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69.
9003	Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).
9004	INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
9005	He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
9006	He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
9007	He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat.
9008	Otherwise, he has been doing well.

9232	Assessment
9233	: 
9234	There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.
9235	Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.
9236	He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE.
9237	He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.
9238	NIHSS was zero.
9239	CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.
9240	There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.
9241	The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.
9242	He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.
9243	Plan: 
9244	- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
9245	- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
9246	- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
9247	- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
9248	- Neuro checks q4 hours
9249	- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
9250	- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
9251	- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
9252	- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
9253	- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
9254	- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.
9255	- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
9256	- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
9257	- Check blood cultures
9258	- Check chromogenic Factor X level
9259	- PT/OT evaluation
9260	- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130
9261	Thank you for this consult.

9277	Dear Dr. Berg:
9278	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.
9279	As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.
9280	He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
9281	He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.
9282	He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.
9283	He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
9284	The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
9285	The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.
9286	Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.
9287	He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
9288	He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
9289	His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.
9290	He is in atrial fibrillation.
9291	His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.
9292	His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
9293	His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.
9294	There is no hematoma or bruit.
9295	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
9296	His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.
9297	His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.
9298	His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.
9299	His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.
9300	We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o.
9301	daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
9302	daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.
9303	He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.
9304	He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
9305	daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
9306	daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o.

9336	Dear Dr. Dill:
9337	DOB:  10/11/2082
9338	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
9339	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
9340	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
9341	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
9342	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
9343	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
9344	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
9345	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
9346	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
9347	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
9348	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
9349	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
9350	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
9351	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
9352	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
9353	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
9354	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
9355	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
9356	His weight has been stable.
9357	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
9358	His weight has remained stable.
9359	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
9360	Past Medical History:
9361	1.
9362	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
9363	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
9364	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
9365	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
9366	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
9367	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
9368	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
9369	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
9370	2.
9371	Hypertension.
9372	3.
9373	Dyslipidemia.
9374	4.
9375	Diabetes.
9376	5.
9377	Obstructive sleep apnea.
9378	6.
9379	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
9380	7.
9381	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
9382	8.?
9383	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
9384	9.
9385	Atrial fibrillation.
9386	10.
9387	Obesity.
9388	He has no known drug allergies.
9389	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
9390	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
9391	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
9392	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
9393	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
9394	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
9395	His father lived until the age of 88.
9396	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
9397	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
9398	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
9399	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
9400	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
9401	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
9402	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
9403	There is no wheezing.
9404	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
9405	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
9406	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
9407	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
9408	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
9409	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
9410	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
9411	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
9412	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
9413	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
9414	He appears to be functional class III.
9415	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
9416	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
9417	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
9418	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
9419	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
9420	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
9421	We will leave this decision to them.
9422	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
9423	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
9424	We will be in touch following the procedure.
9425	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
9426	Sincerely,

9440	"Reason for Visit	"
9441	Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.
9442	"Problems	  "
9443	"Congestive heart failure	      "
9444	He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.
9445	He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.
9446	He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.
9447	Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.
9448	Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.
9449	Moderate LV margin.
9450	Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).
9451	Dilated aortic loop.
9452	Normal RV size and function.
9453	Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.
9454	He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.
9455	He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
9456	"coronary artery disease	      "
9457	After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.
9458	Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.
9459	10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.
9460	Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.
9461	The L main had no significant lesions.
9462	The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.
9463	He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.
9464	He was discharged the following day without complications.
9465	Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.
9466	"pacemaker	      "
9467	S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.
9468	Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.
9469	"S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      "
9470	12/76.
9471	10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT.
9472	CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD.
9473	AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST.
9474	FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT.
9475	TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.
9476	[04-Nov-2078]
9477	He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  
9478	"hypertension	      "
9479	BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.
9480	If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol
9481	"diabetes mellitus	      "
9482	He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
9483	He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.
9484	Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.
9485	"hypercholesterolemia	      "
9486	He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.
9487	We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.
9488	"nephropathy	      "
9489	S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
9490	As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.
9491	He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.
9492	[02-Jun-2087]
9493	Recheck BUN and creatinine today.
9494	"peripheral vascular disease	      "
9495	He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.
9496	"RECTAL FISTULA	      "
9497	SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE.
9498	SIG.
9499	HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA.
9500	HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.
9501	PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.
9502	CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.
9503	"OSTEOARTHRITIS	      "
9504	He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.
9505	"It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs."
9506	Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.
9507	Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.
9508	"Carotid stenosis	      "
9509	According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.
9510	Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.
9511	He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.
9512	"Review of Systems	"
9513	Small lesion on his R ear.
9514	Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.
9515	Nocturia X1.
9516	Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.
9517	No neurologic symptoms.
9518	Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.
9519	Denies peripheral edema.
9520	No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.
9521	He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.
9522	No melena.

9615	He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
9616	    current symptoms of angina.
9617	He is s/p CABG and most
9618	    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.
9619	CHF.
9620	He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic

9649	MR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089
9650	    6.
9651	Diabetes mellitus.
9652	He continues on oral agents, watching
9653	    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.
9654	He does not
9655	    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
9656	    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
9657	    of hypoglycemia.
9658	Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
9659	    albumin today.
9660	7.
9661	Cerebral vascular disease.
9662	He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
9663	    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
9664	    has had no new neurologic events.
9665	His most recent carotid
9666	    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
9667	    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
9668	    today.
9669	He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.
9670	8.
9671	Hypercholesterolemia.
9672	His most recent lipid profile is
9673	    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
9674	    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
9675	Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
9676	    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past.
9677	9.
9678	Peripheral vascular disease.
9679	He continues to have bilateral
9680	    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
9681	    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
9682	    of claudication.
9683	10.
9684	Osteoarthritis.
9685	He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
9686	    and is now doing quite well.
9687	Notably, he would require
9688	    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.
9689	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
9690	abdominal pain.
9691	He continues to have a rectal fistula.
9692	Last
9693	year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
9694	sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
9695	presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
9696	bleeds.
9697	He has had no recent edema in his legs.
9698	His left knee is
9699	doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
9700	muscles.
9701	He has nocturia one time per night.

9911	George, Rickey
9912	MRN: 1131414
9913	06/10/92
9914	REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.
9915	PROBLEMS:
9916	1.
9917	Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.
9918	Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.
9919	He was managed by multiple
9920	services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.
9921	His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
9922	with a prolonged course of fluconazole.
9923	Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
9924	effectively with carvedilol.
9925	Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
9926	hospitalization.
9927	He never had any sustained VT or VF.
9928	He was subsequently discharged home
9929	with a Life vest defibrillator.
9930	He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.
9931	He currently has no AICD or
9932	pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
9933	for his arrhythmia issues.
9934	He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.
9935	Currently
9936	his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
9937	regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.
9938	2.
9939	CHF.
9940	Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
9941	directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him.
9942	He had one episode of CHF, which
9943	was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.
9944	At the
9945	present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
9946	night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
9947	He does
9948	continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
9949	3.
9950	Coronary artery disease.
9951	Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
9952	angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
9953	4.
9954	Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.
9955	His left TKR also required removal
9956	due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.
9957	He has had no
9958	recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
9959	issues.
9960	He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
9961	down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.
9962	5.
9963	Diabetes mellitus.
9964	Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
9965	twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
9966	has been gradually decreased.
9967	He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
9968	and he reports that his fasting
9969	sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
9970	range.
9971	He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.
9972	We will check
9973	his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
9974	Page 2
9975	6.
9976	Hyperlipidemia.
9977	He continues on Lipitor.
9978	We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
9979	CPK.
9980	7.
9981	Diabetic nephropathy.
9982	He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
9983	to re-establish baseline.
9984	8.
9985	Status post CVA.
9986	Known moderate right carotid stenosis.
9987	Minimal residual dysarthria
9988	and right-sided weakness.
9989	Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.
9990	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.
9991	Was unable to get sufficient blood
9992	pressure by cuff.
9993	Pulse 60, mostly irregular.
9994	General, thin, but no distress.
9995	Lungs, clear to
9996	auscultation and percussion.
9997	Cor, distant heart sounds.
9998	No S3 appreciated.
9999	Old pacer/AICD site.
10000	No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.
10001	Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.
10002	DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.
10003	ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
10004	both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
10005	At this time, he was
10006	quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
10007	He did deny
10008	abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
10009	At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
10010	send in to me by mail.
10011	I have also sent off a CBC today.
10012	I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
10013	next visit.
10014	If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
10015	more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
10016	aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

10112	"	Interval History:"
10113	   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
10114	Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
10115	Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
10116	Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
10117	The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
10118	A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
10119	There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
10120	A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
10121	Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
10122	RV function was normal.
10123	He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
10124	He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
10125	He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted.
10126	He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
10127	The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
10128	LV EF 63%.
10129	He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
10130	His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.
10131	A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
10132	The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
10133	LV EF 68%.
10134	He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
10135	He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
10136	He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.
10137	He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
10138	His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
10139	Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
10140	This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
10141	Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
10142	He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e.
10143	muscolskeletal in nature).
10144	He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
10145	He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
10146	He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
10147	No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
10148	He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
10149	He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
10150	He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
10151	Past medical history:
10152	   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
10153	Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
10154	2) Hypertension
10155	3) Hyperlipideimia
10156	4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI

10178	"	EKG:"
10179	   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.
10180	Assessment and plan:
10181	   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
10182	1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.
10183	Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
10184	Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
10185	He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
10186	His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
10187	The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
10188	He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
10189	His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
10190	However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
10191	I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
10192	2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.
10193	His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
10194	Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.
10195	He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
10196	flushing).
10197	He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
10198	After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.
10199	He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
10200	He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
10201	3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
10202	He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

10210	cc: ADDENDUM: I spoke with the patient on 12/21 and his chest discomfort symptoms have resolved and he is feeling well in his usual activities.
10211	So, no further testing at this point.
10212	He will call me if symptoms recur.

10222	   Primary cardiologist: Jan Ivory (Kevin Mcdaniel)
10223	61 y/o M with h/o CAD admitted for CP.
10224	Cardiovascular history notable for:
10225	- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
10226	- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
10227	- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%
10228	He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.
10229	He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.
10230	He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.
10231	Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.
10232	No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.
10233	Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.
10234	Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.
10235	After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.
10236	Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.
10237	At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.
10238	Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.
10239	Past medical history:
10240	   - CAD - as above
10241	- HTN
10242	- hyperlipidemia
10243	- DM2 - no known microvascular disease; last A1c 7.3 (June 36)
10244	- Ankylosing spondylitis
10245	- h/o thrombophlebitis (vs DVT) of left leg
10246	- hemorrhoids s/p banding

10288	In terms of subtle LLL opacity on CXR, doubt PNA given lack of cough, sputum or  fever...He has mild leukocytosis (normal differential) of unclear etiology.
10289	Plan:
10290	- cycle troponins
10291	- continue IV heparin overnight
10292	- if biomarkers negative and no recurrent CP, would favor ETT-MIBI in AM for further risk stratification

10372	Follow Up - post hospitalization visit
10373	He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.
10374	On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.
10375	As a result he did not exercise that day.
10376	The symptoms improved spontaneously.
10377	On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.
10378	Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.
10379	Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.
10380	He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.
10381	There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.
10382	He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.
10383	"When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion."
10384	He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.
10385	He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.
10386	Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.
10387	He is feeling great.
10388	He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.
10389	He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.
10390	He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.
10391	He has had no groin hematoma or other complications.

10548	                                              8-02-73
10549	HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
10550	treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.
10551	He was seen in MHC 
10552	clinic prior to that.
10553	His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
10554	number is 872-9985.
10555	Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
10556	that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
10557	not seen a physician in the past year.
10558	His medical problems include:
10559	1.
10560	Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.
10561	It is unclear 
10562	     which vessels were plastied.
10563	2.
10564	Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
10565	     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.
10566	However, he has not taken any 
10567	     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well.
10568	3.
10569	Anxiety.
10570	4.
10571	Condyloma last fall.
10572	Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.
10573	; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
10574	q.h.s.
10575	prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.
10576	Patient also had 
10577	nitroglycerin tablets at home.
10578	Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
10579	t.i.d.
10580	; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.
10581	He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
10582	Social history:  He is currently not working.
10583	He has been unemployed for 
10584	a month and a half.
10585	He used to be a social worker which did not 
10586	involve any heavy lifting.
10587	He did community services managment.
10588	He 
10589	lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.
10590	Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
10591	chest pains over the last 10 years.
10592	However, he does say that his last 
10593	chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.
10594	When asked where the 
10595	pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
10596	pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
10597	angioplasty.
10598	He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
10599	relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.
10600	At the 
10601	time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.
10602	He has no 
10603	history of exertional angina over the last several years.
10604	However, this 
10605	complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.
10606	currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
10607	exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
10608	On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
10609	apparent distress.
10610	Temperature was afebrile.
10611	Heart rate was 68 and 
10612	regular.
10613	Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
10614	position.
10615	HEENT was within normal limits.
10616	Lungs were clear bilaterally.
10617	Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
10618	Abdomen was benign.
10619	Extremities were without edema or lesions.

10621	Page 2                                        55931516
10622	Assessment and Plan:
10623	Cardiovascular.
10624	Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
10625	     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
10626	     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.
10627	Given that he is on 
10628	     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
10629	     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d.
10630	in an attempt to 
10631	     control his blood pressure and heart rate.
10632	I also encouraged him to 
10633	     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
10634	     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.
10635	The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
10636	     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.
10637	After he 
10638	     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
10639	     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
10640	     evidence of ischemia at this time.
10641	If he does, we will recommend a 
10642	     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
10643	     causing syms of rest angina.
10644	The case was discussed with any 
10645	     cardiacs that are on call.
10646	Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
10647	     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
10648	     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
10649	     has at a level of 336.
10650	He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
10651	     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.
10652	I 
10653	     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
10654	     diet and explained which food contain those products.
10655	I will also 
10656	     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
10657	     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.
10658	We will start him 
10659	     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d.
10660	later this week.
10661	Daily anxiety.
10662	Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
10663	     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
10664	     Ativan.
10665	History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.
10666	Patient 
10667	     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
10668	     his next visit.
10669	If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
10670	     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

10674	     status post losing his job and LBH insurance last year.
10675	The 
10676	     patient's home phone number is 534-3442.

11296	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
11297	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
11298	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
11299	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
11300	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
11301	-Telemetry
11302	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
11303	-If positive will start heparin gtt
11304	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
11305	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
11306	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix
11307	-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)
11308	#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs.
11309	The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease.
11310	Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP.
11311	Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct.
11312	-f/u smear
11313	-monitor CBC
11314	#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival
11315	-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)
11316	#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose
11317	-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123
11318	-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM
11319	#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7
11320	-FSBG AC+HS
11321	-RISS AC
11322	#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.
11323	-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70
11324	-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine
11325	-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection
11326	#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response
11327	-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)
11328	#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs
11329	-Urine tox
11330	-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings
11331	-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation
11332	-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624
11333	-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital
11334	-Continue methadone while in house
11335	#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin
11336	-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)
11337	#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
11338	#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax
11339	#) Dispo: likely home pending cardiac w/u

11352	HPI:  50 y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain.
11353	He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.
11354	He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.
11355	At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.
11356	"Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like ""I was being crushed like a sandwich."""
11357	Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.
11358	EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA.
11359	On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.
11360	His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.
11361	On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ?
11362	aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.
11363	He received ASA and SLTNG
11364	Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).
11365	No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.
11366	Course on floor:
11367	Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.
11368	During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.
11369	BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63.
11370	(2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.
11371	Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia.
11372	Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.
11373	Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather.
11374	Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.
11375	On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.
11376	He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.
11377	SDU Course:
11378	For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.

11501	"Re:	Russell Urban	"
11502	"WRH#	4722064	"
11503	Dear Dr. Ussery:
11504	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
11505	As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.
11506	He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
11507	By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.
11508	He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.
11509	That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
11510	He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
11511	The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
11512	Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
11513	He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
11514	This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
11515	A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
11516	He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
11517	A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.
11518	This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
11519	His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
11520	Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
11521	He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
11522	Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
11523	He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
11524	He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.
11525	He has felt very well.
11526	He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
11527	His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
11528	Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
11529	He was evaluated and released.
11530	He never had any further testing.
11531	He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
11532	Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
11533	His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.
11534	He has no known drug allergies.
11535	Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
11536	He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
11537	He has been working in Borders.
11538	He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.
11539	He has no children.
11540	He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
11541	He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
11542	He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
11543	On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.
11544	His heart rate is 60 and regular.
11545	In general, he is in no apparent distress.
11546	His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
11547	His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
11548	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
11549	He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
11550	His abdomen is benign.
11551	His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
11552	On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
11553	His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
11554	His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
11555	The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
11556	His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
11557	His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.
11558	His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
11559	He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
11560	Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
11561	He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.
11562	His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
11563	His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
11564	There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
11565	His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
11566	In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
11567	Also, his systolic function has improved over time.
11568	I think there are two processes going on.
11569	One is coronary artery disease.
11570	Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
11571	The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
11572	Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
11573	He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.
11574	I suspect that this is myocarditis.
11575	Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
11576	It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
11577	From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.
11578	He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.
11579	For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
11580	His LDL goal will be less than 100.
11581	He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.
11582	His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
11583	I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
11584	I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
11585	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
11586	The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.
11587	Sincerely,

11599	Mr Urban is admitted s/p PTCA/stent x 2 (Cyphers) to his LCX today
11600	"History of Present Illness	"
11601	     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93.
11602	He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward.
11603	Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.
11604	He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia.
11605	EF at that time was 51%.
11606	He has done reasonably well since then.
11607	In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion.
11608	He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95.
11609	EKG was positive for ischemia.
11610	Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia.
11611	His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.
11612	Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA.
11613	Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions.
11614	His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results.
11615	He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

11787	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
11788	Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.
11789	He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
11790	"While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure""."
11791	He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes.
11792	There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.
11793	"An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG."
11794	Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized.
11795	"On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels."
11796	Stent placement was not attempted.
11797	His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward.
11798	A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 
11799	ASA 81 mg
11800	Plavix 75 mg po qd
11801	Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
11802	Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
11803	Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
11804	Lipitor 40 mg po qd
11805	A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
11806	Metformin 1000 mg po bid
11807	Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital.
11808	He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes.
11809	It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:
11810	Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.
11811	Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.
11812	No chest pain was    reported.
11813	Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.
11814	The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.
11815	See exercise report for full ECG details.
11816	Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.
11817	There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.
11818	Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
11819	Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%.
11820	No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.
11821	Trace mitral regurgitation.4.
11822	Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.
11823	All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
11824	Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.
11825	At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.
11826	Glycemic control ahs been variable.
11827	Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.
11828	Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.

11897	Dear Gray:
11898	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
11899	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
11900	I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
11901	I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
11902	The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
11903	At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
11904	He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
11905	He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal).
11906	An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
11907	An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
11908	Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
11909	Since then, he has had no further episodes.
11910	ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope.
11911	He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
11912	PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).
11913	Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening.
11914	This is an Equadorian formulation.
11915	SHx:
11916	He does not drink, nor smoke.
11917	FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
11918	Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
11919	On exam, he looks well.
11920	His heart rate is in the 64.
11921	His blood pressure was 115/70.
11922	His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
11923	His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
11924	His chest was clear to auscultation.
11925	His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
11926	His abdomen was soft.
11927	Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
11928	Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
11929	In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease.
11930	He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
11931	I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.
11932	With warm regards,  
11933	Sincerely yours,
11934	Record date: 2126-01-04
11935	This is an urgent care visit for Mr. Valdivia.he is c/o URI like sx with nasal congestion, non productive couch and sore throat for several days.
11936	he is also c/o pressure in his sinuses and congestion in his eyes with excessive tearing.
11937	He has also been c/o progreesive SOB, he is diabetic with CAD s/p CABG and states that after his cardiac rehab finished about two months ago he sarted c/o progressively worsening SOB and he is now back to the level he was at before his surgery with SOB developing after walking for 50 yards.
11938	he has been compliant with his medications and contacted his cardiologist regarding these sx and was told he should be seen today by the cardiologist covering for his regular cardiologist who is away, but he refused and opted to wait till his cardiologist comes back next week.
11939	he denies any chest pain, but admits to bipedal swelling frequently.
11940	ROS: negative in detail except as above.

12114	MRN:  8099832
12115	ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
12116	PCP:  unknown
12117	CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital
12118	HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.
12119	At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.
12120	As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.
12121	Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.
12122	Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.
12123	During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.
12124	At present, pt.
12125	c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.
12126	She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.
12127	Hospital Course: 
12128	MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt.
12129	was started on IV vancomycin.
12130	The bacteremic source remains unclear.
12131	TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.
12132	A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.
12133	Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.
12134	A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
12135	Back pain: Pt.
12136	c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.
12137	Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.
12138	An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.
12139	The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.
12140	No epidural extension was noted.
12141	There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.
12142	Pt.
12143	received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.
12144	As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.
12145	A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.
12146	A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.
12147	A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.
12148	Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.
12149	Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.
12150	A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.
12151	The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.
12152	An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.
12153	A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.
12154	Renal failure:  Pt.
12155	developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.
12156	Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.
12157	Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.
12158	Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.
12159	She was started on procrit by hematology.
12160	She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
12161	TIA:  Pt.
12162	has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.
12163	An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.
12164	This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.
12165	A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.
12166	No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.
12167	HTN: Pt.
12168	required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.
12169	MEDICAL HISTORY
12170	Recurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalization

12269	Record date: 2102-12-01
12270	ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.
12271	HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.
12272	Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.
12273	Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.
12274	Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.
12275	She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.
12276	In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.
12277	She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.
12278	She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.
12279	Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.
12280	She was transferred to GCH in August.
12281	She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.
12282	She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.
12283	She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.
12284	She was discharged to rehab in mid September.
12285	She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.
12286	She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.
12287	She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.
12288	She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.
12289	The arm swelling quickly resolved.
12290	There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.
12291	She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.
12292	MEDS:  Coumadin 7.5 mg qd,  Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000.

12310	LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.
12311	If normalized then will add back Lipitor.
12312	History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.
12313	2)  Hypertension.
12314	Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.
12315	3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.
12316	Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.
12317	With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.
12318	She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.
12319	INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.
12320	4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.
12321	Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.
12322	5)  History of hypothyroidism.
12323	Had recent labs at SRH on  12/04/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of  0.9.
12324	6)  History of anemia, requiring Procrit and ?
12325	transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on  12/04/02.

12327	Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.
12328	History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.
12329	History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ?
12330	TIA left hemisphere, ?
12331	repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.
12332	On Plavix and coumadin.
12333	Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.
12334	8)  History of elevated LFT's.
12335	May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.
12336	Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

12349	HPI: 
12350	Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.
12351	Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099.
12352	She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures.
12353	She was started on Depakote for this.
12354	Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures.
12355	EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.
12356	In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope.
12357	Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.
12358	Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.
12359	When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.
12360	These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.
12361	Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.
12362	She does not recall the events herself.
12363	The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).
12364	The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.
12365	In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.
12366	She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management.
12367	The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.
12368	Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.
12369	The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.

12542	EKG: Sinus at 86.
12543	Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.
12544	CXR 7/28: NAD
12545	Chest CT 4/03: 
12546	IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
12547	     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
12548	     apex.
12549	Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
12550	     tiny lung nodules seen.
12551	MRI 9/02
12552	     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
12553	     ischemia.
12554	There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
12555	     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
12556	     hole or craniotomy.
12557	There are chronic appearing, small right
12558	     cerebellar infarcts.
12559	There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
12560	     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
12561	     with small vessel ischemic change.
12562	There is FLAIR hyperintensity
12563	     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
12564	     parietal and left occipital lobes.
12565	No abnormal enhancement is
12566	     seen.
12567	The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
12568	     unremarkable.
12569	The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
12570	There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
12571	There is
12572	     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
12573	There are
12574	     bilateral lens implants.
12575	The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
12576	     otherwise unremarkable.
12577	MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
12578	     posterior cerbral artery.
12579	There is diffuse irregularity of the
12580	     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.
12581	There is moderate
12582	     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
12583	The
12584	     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.
12585	     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
12586	     the circle of Willis.
12587	Impression:
12588	     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
12589	     predominance as described.
12590	This could represent hemorrhage, high
12591	     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
12592	     injection.
12593	Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
12594	     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.
12595	Diffuse irregularity
12596	     of the left posterior cerebral artery.
12597	These findings could be
12598	     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
12599	     vasculitis is another possibility.
12600	Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
12601	No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
12602	Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
12603	Small vessel ischemic changes.
12604	Carotid US 3/02
12605	IMPRESSIONS:
12606	RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.
12607	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
12608	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
12609	BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.
12610	Echo    01
12611	Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
12612	    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.
12613	Left ventricular
12614	    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.
12615	There is no flattening of the
12616	    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
12617	    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
12618	    arterial pressure.
12619	There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
12620	    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
12621	There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
12622	    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
12623	There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
12624	    represent atherosclerotic change.
12625	The aortic valve is trileaflet.
12626	Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
12627	    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
12628	    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
12629	    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.
12630	There is no evident aortic stenosis
12631	    or aortic insufficiency.
12632	Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.
12633	Otherwise,
12634	    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.
12635	Normal appearing tricuspid
12636	    and pulmonary leaflets.
12637	There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
12638	    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
12639	Flow velocity could not be optimally
12640	    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
12641	    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
12642	There is no evident pericardial effusion.
12643	ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
12644	1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.
12645	History from family sounds much more like seizure.
12646	Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.
12647	Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.
12648	Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.

12667	Dear Dr. Mcfarland:
12668	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.
12669	As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture.
12670	Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies.
12671	She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.
12672	Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.
12673	She has had a negative cardiac stress test.
12674	PMH as above
12675	Meds: synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa
12676	Allergies: PCN, cephalosporins, vancomysin, shellfish
12677	SH: no tobacco ever.
12678	She is a professional tool maker.

12694	PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal.
12695	There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator.
12696	The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit.
12697	Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated.
12698	Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.
12699	IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial.
12700	It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed.
12701	In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab.
12702	Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture.
12703	There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either.
12704	I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her.
12705	I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma.
12706	We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.
12707	Seen and d/w Dr. Weller

13119	Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are
13120	"	consistent with asbestos exposure."
13121	There is no pneumothorax.
13122	No
13123	pleural effusions are visualized.
13124	There is extensive change including both shoulders.
13125	Assessment:  85 y/o with medically management multivessel CAD who presents with light-headedness, fatigue and anemia.
13126	Likely coffee gound emesis, melana and increased BUN concerning for UGIB.
13127	Given history of alcohol consumption (suspect that consumption may be slightly more than given by history) and NSAID use, gastritis is a possibility.
13128	No clear reason for other sources of UGIB.
13129	Pt also found to be in Afib of unknown duration.
13130	Unclear if Afib was prompted by anemia due to UGIB.
13131	Plan:
13132	UGIB
13133	a.
13134	Active blood back sample, IV access
13135	"b.	Hct increased from 22.2 to 24.7 after 2u pRBCs."
13136	Given CAD history, will transfuse one more unit
13137	"c.	GI consult for possible EGD (pt likely also needs colonoscopy given h/o tubular adenoma)"
13138	"d.	IV zantac "
13139	"e.	Hold aspirin for now"
13140	CV
13141	Ischemia - TVI on admission on ECG from ED.
13142	Will cycle cardiac enzymes.
13143	Hold aspirin for now given GIB.
13144	Continue beta blocker both for ischemia protection and AF rate control; will hold other anti-hypertensives for now
13145	b.
13146	Rhythm - unclear duration of Afib so immediate cardioversion not an option (avoid TEE in the setting of UGIB); lopressor for rate control; no anticoagulation for now; central telmetry
13147	"c.	Pump - no active issues "
13148	"3.	increased WBC "

13783	She had previously been on the CVH pancreas transplant list and had full cardiac workup including recent dobutamine echo which revealed normal LV function and no ischemia.
13784	However, there was concern about her extensive visceral and iliac vascular calcification by CT which rendered her high surgical risk.
13785	She is understandably upset about this reclassification and is here today for an overview of her cardiac status.

13855	RE:  Shilpa Pickett
13856	     MR #129-53-47-3
13857	Dear Philip:
13858	I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
13859	Clinic today.
13860	Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
13861	she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
13862	chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain.
13863	She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
13864	is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
13865	position.
13866	As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
13867	of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.
13868	Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
13869	po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.
13870	Of note, she was
13871	taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.
13872	Labetalol 200
13873	mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
13874	mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
13875	On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
13876	seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12.
13877	There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
13878	Carotids are free
13879	of bruits.
13880	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
13881	Cardiac
13882	exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.
13883	Abdomen
13884	is soft and nontender.
13885	The extremities are free of edema.
13886	Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
13887	block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
13888	In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
13889	factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
13890	increase in weight.
13891	We will be rechecking her lipid profile today.
13892	She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
13893	she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.
13894	She
13895	notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression.
13896	She has had no change in her hair or skin.
13897	For the 
13898	Pickett, Shilpa
13899	MR #129-53-47-3               -2-            October 13, 2061
13900	moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
13901	dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
13902	hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.
13903	It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
13904	Pickett' care.
13905	Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
13906	can be of help with.

14211	RE:  Jennifer Vance
14212	     MR #542-66-00-3
14213	Dear Vester:
14214	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
14215	evaluation.
14216	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
14217	briefly for our records.
14218	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
14219	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
14220	significant coronary artery disease.
14221	In 2061, after a four to five
14222	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
14223	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
14224	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
14225	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
14226	inadequate results.
14227	She therefore was taken electively for
14228	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
14229	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
14230	She subsequently continued to
14231	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
14232	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
14233	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
14234	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
14235	The catheterization
14236	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
14237	artery graft.
14238	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
14239	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
14240	She recently has undergone an
14241	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
14242	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
14243	Trials
14244	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
14245	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
14246	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
14247	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
14248	She had no
14249	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
14250	Over the past two weeks
14251	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
14252	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
14253	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
14254	The pain is not
14255	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
14256	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
14257	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a
14258	cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.

14260	MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069
14261	Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin
14262	dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's
14263	contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.
14264	Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,
14265	NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.
14266	Allergies:  None.
14267	Cigarettes - none.
14268	Ethanol - social.
14269	Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,
14270	mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one
14271	brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother
14272	dying from melanoma age 36.
14273	The rest of her siblings and children
14274	have not heart disease.
14275	Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.
14276	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,
14277	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.
14278	The neck is
14279	supple.
14280	JVP flat.
14281	Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
14282	greater than left bruits.
14283	Chest is clear.
14284	Cardiac exam shows a
14285	normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection
14286	murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant
14287	diastolic murmur.
14288	The abdomen is benign.
14289	Extremities reveal no
14290	appreciable edema.
14291	Peripheral pulses are intact.
14292	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
14293	PR interval
14294	of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.
14295	There are minor
14296	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
14297	Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
14298	variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and
14299	dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
14300	She has had a
14301	retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
14302	most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
14303	significant provokable ischemia.
14304	Nonetheless, I am concerned that
14305	her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
14306	I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
14307	I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
14308	studies.
14309	In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
14310	dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive
14311	antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
14312	Unless her variegata porphyria
14313	precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po
14314	q.d.
14315	I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
14316	In
14317	addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d.
14318	and
14319	I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
14320	porphyria does not

14322	preclude this.
14323	She understands that if she has evidence for
14324	significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
14325	to undergo repeat coronary angiography.
14326	Thank you very much for
14327	allowing me to assist in her care.

14346	Nathan J Fernandes M.D.
14347	College Station, NC 22169
14348	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
14349	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
14350	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
14351	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
14352	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
14353	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
14354	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
14355	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
14356	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
14357	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
14358	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
14359	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
14360	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
14361	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.
14362	Past medical history:
14363	   Hypertension.
14364	Hyperlipidemia.

14389	-Heent:   Benign
14390	-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits
14391	-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs
14392	-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
14393	S1 and S2.
14394	There is no murmur, rub, or gallop
14395	-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.
14396	There are no masses or bruits appreciated
14397	-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.
14398	Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.
14399	Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration
14400	-BP: 145/80    on the right
14401	"	Other Data:"
14402	   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.
14403	Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.
14404	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
14405	Assessment and plan:
14406	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
14407	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
14408	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
14409	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
14410	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
14411	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
14412	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
14413	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
14414	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
14415	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
14416	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
14417	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
14418	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
14419	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
14420	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
14421	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

14557	RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.
14558	Dear Dr. Cooper:
14559	  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes.
14560	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
14561	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
14562	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
14563	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
14564	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
14565	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
14566	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
14567	He returns today for review.
14568	He remains in reasonable health.
14569	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
14570	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
14571	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
14572	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
14573	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.
14574	Past medical history:
14575	   CAD 
14576	-- 2082 CABG x 3 
14577	-- 10/9/91 LIMA to LAD patent; mod LAD stenosis beyond graft; SVT to OM patent; SVG to RCA occl @ origin 
14578	-- 10/91 rota-stenting of mid RCA 99% --&gt; 0% 
14579	Hypertension.

14638	He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia.
14639	Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.
14640	Assessment and plan:
14641	   1.
14642	CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.
14643	2.
14644	PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.

14670	Thanks for allowing us to participate in his care.
14671	Best personal regards,
14672	Nicholas B Fuchs MD
14673	I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS.
14674	I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.
14675	I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.
14676	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.
14677	Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG.
14678	He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors.
14679	but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.

14789	      Assessment and plan:
14790	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
14791	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
14792	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
14793	Problems:
14794	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
14795	Takes it about once/month.
14796	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
14797	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
14798	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
14799	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
14800	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
14801	Continue her present dose of statin.
14802	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
14803	Continue her current regimen.

14826	History of Present Illness
14827	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
14828	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
14829	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
14830	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
14831	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
14832	He presents now for cath and surgery.

14926	Assessment
14927	58-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM, HTN  and ESRF on dialysis.
14928	In addition he has ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by severe mitral regurgitation.
14929	He has been reluctant to consider surgery in the past but in the face of worsening symptoms has now agreed to proceed.

14937	Record date: 2067-08-02
14938	60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.
14939	It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.
14940	He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.
14941	He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.
14942	In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.
14943	Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.
14944	He was discharged without clear follow-up.
14945	The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.
14946	He has been ambulating on the wound.
14947	He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.
14948	He reports no pain.
14949	Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.
14950	Review of systems is otherwise negative.

15159	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
15160	Assessment/Plan
15161	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
15162	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
15163	S/P Rt TMA.
15164	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
15165	By issue:
15166	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
15167	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
15168	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
15169	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
15170	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
15171	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
15172	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
15173	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
15174	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
15175	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
15176	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
15177	Might hold ranitidine as well.
15178	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
15179	Currently on olanzapine.
15180	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
15181	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
15182	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
15183	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
15184	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
15185	Would seek ID input to the end.
15186	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
15187	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
15188	Recs per nephrology
15189	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
15190	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
15191	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
15192	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
15193	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
15194	Thanks,

15406	Dear Dr. Huerta:
15407	Reason for visit:
15408	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
15409	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
15410	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
15411	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
15412	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
15413	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
15414	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
15415	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
15416	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
15417	The patient has been managed medically since then.
15418	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
15419	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
15420	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
15421	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
15422	His weight has been up and down.
15423	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
15424	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
15425	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
15426	Past medical history:
15427	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
15428	Current Medications:
15429	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
15430	 Glucophage 1 g BID
15431	 glyburide 10 mg BID
15432	 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM
15433	 Lopid 600 mg BID
15434	 allopurinol 300 mg QD
15435	 omeprazole 20 mg QD
15436	 aspirin 81 mg QD
15437	 Pravachol 80 mg QD
15438	 Avandia 8 mg QD
15439	Allergies:
15440	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
15441	Family history:
15442	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
15443	Social history:
15444	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
15445	Review of systems:
15446	   As above, otherwise negative.
15447	Physical examination:
15448	-Pulse:   60
15449	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
15450	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
15451	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
15452	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
15453	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
15454	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
15455	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
15456	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
15457	Selected recent labs:
15458	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
15459	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
15460	Assessment and plan:
15461	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
15462	He is doing well.
15463	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
15464	He is currently not anticoagulated.
15465	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
15466	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
15467	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
15468	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
15469	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
15470	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
15471	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
15472	Changes to Medications this visit

15632	CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation.
15633	HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter.
15634	Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR.
15635	Pt did well post cardioversion.
15636	He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis.
15637	Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically.
15638	Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology.
15639	He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter.
15640	Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73.
15641	The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm.
15642	He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

15733	NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly
15734	MRN:      3299811 
15735	INITIAL VISIT 
15736	This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit.
15737	The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
15738	recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
15739	syndrome and back/chest pain.
15740	Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
15741	She was found to have a blood
15742	pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
15743	headaches.
15744	She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
15745	found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
15746	She was transferred to the
15747	Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic
15748	convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
15749	She also suffered a urinary tract
15750	infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.
15751	She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,
15752	at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
15753	On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of
15754	127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.
15755	She had a myxedematous face and
15756	was obese.
15757	She was cardiovascularly stable.
15758	Neurologically, she was able to move
15759	all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
15760	Cranial nerves
15761	intact.
15762	Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to
15763	elevated blood pressure.
15764	Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
15765	Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar
15766	puncture, both of which were negative.
15767	Electroencephalogram was  performed and
15768	showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
15769	The patient's
15770	alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
15771	She had
15772	an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral
15773	leads.
15774	Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
15775	The patient underwent a course of
15776	physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
15777	A
15778	specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
15779	this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
15780	use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
15781	threshold for seizure activity.
15782	Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.
15783	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,
15784	panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone

15860	"ID/CC:	Change in mental status"
15861	HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days.
15862	Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission.
15863	As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days.
15864	They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused.
15865	The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day.
15866	On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night.
15867	She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.
15868	The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.
15869	The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.
15870	She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.
15871	ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB.

15878	Angina pectoris - negative stress 
15879	Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH.
15880	Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.
15881	Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis
15882	Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT

16178	Date: 6/29/97
16179	Time of Exam: 5:20 p.m.
16180	NICU day: 1
16181	Critically ill secondary to: 
16182	R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration
16183	Critical Care Min: 35 min
16184	History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness.
16185	BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived.
16186	Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.
16187	Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
16188	and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.
16189	She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.
16190	CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
16191	She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.
16192	At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.
16193	She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.
16194	PMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes
16195	Home meds: Mirtazapine 15 mg daily, Namenda 10 mg daily, Potassium supplementation 20 meq daily, Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, Metoprolol (unclear if metoprolol succinate or tartrate) 25 mg daily, Prednisone 2.5 mg daily, MVI
16196	All: Morphine ( Unknown ) Codeine ( Unknown ) ACE Inhibitor ( Unknown ) LISINOPRIL (cough ) CIPROFLOXACIN HCL (dec effects of sz med ) ATORVASTATIN (abnormal LFT )

UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l
16225	Imaging/Studies/TCD: 
16226	Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.
16227	CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
16228	Assessment: 
16229	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
16230	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
16231	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.
16232	Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

16367	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
16368	gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
16369	post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
16370	1.
16371	He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.
16372	These are 
16373	improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
16374	128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
16375	ranging from 150 to 190.
16376	He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
16377	units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
16378	at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.
16379	He has not had any 
16380	further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
16381	seems to be sticking more to the diet.
16382	He has however gained some 
16383	weight, which is a little disconcerting.
16384	He does attend a podiatrist 
16385	and is doing well from that perspective.
16386	He is to return to the 
16387	ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.

16717	His most recent labs are within reasonable range with an LDL of 76 and fasting triglycerides 263, which improved from his previous values.
16718	He has been intolerant to Lopid which resulted in pancreatitis.
16719	He has not lost any weight, but has begun to exercise.
16720	Allergic rhinitis
16721	He has chronic postnasal drip and nasal congestion for which he uses Nasonex on a regular basis with some improvement.

16728	The patient continues on his ranitidine at night with improvement in his intermittent epigastric discomfort.
16729	Sleep apnea
16730	The patient had a sleep study in November 2091 due to excessive fatigue and snoring.

16732	He has not been using the CPAP since he was recently on vacation, but he plans to start in the near future.
16733	During his sleep study, he was not uncomfortable wearing the mask and hopefully, this will help.

16741	He exercises on a treadmill five times a week and can walk up to five miles in any given setting.
16742	He does not have any palpitations, chest pressure, pain, or significant dyspnea on exertion.
16743	Diabetes mellitus
16744	The patient checks his blood sugars at home, and they have been in the 120 range, although he admits to not losing weight and on his recent trip was not exercising as regularly.

17022	  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.
17023	History of present illness
17024	  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.
17025	Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.
17026	He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.
17027	At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.
17028	He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.
17029	He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.
17030	He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.
17031	He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.
17032	He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.
17033	He is here for a followup.
17034	Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.
17035	His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

17265	Reactions to Medicines: None
17266	Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness
17267	History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.
17268	He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
17269	In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
17270	He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
17271	On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.
17272	He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.
17273	He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.
17274	ROS:Const.-Negative
17275	Eyes -Negative
17276	ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss
17277	CV: See above
17278	Respiratory: Sleep apnea
17279	GI -.
17280	Recent constipation  
17281	GU -Impotence.
17282	Urgency and incontinence  
17283	MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.
17284	Considering knee replacement
17285	Skin - Negative
17286	Neuro -CVA in past.
17287	Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.
17288	Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa
17289	Endocrine -  Diabetes
17290	Heme-No blood problems
17291	Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye
17292	Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
17293	He has no other major illnesses.
17294	He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.
17295	Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.
17296	Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
17297	Two sisters are living without diabetes.
17298	Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.
17299	He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.
17300	His significant other works as an optician.
17301	She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.
17302	Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
17303	BP 100 50/65.
17304	His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.
17305	He has no rales.
17306	He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.
17307	He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
17308	EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA
17309	Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
17310	He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
17311	In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
17312	I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
17313	I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
17314	Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
17315	I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
17316	Of course the catheterization will determine that.
17317	He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

17477	HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.
17478	He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.
17479	He was free of disease since then until May 2073.
17480	He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).
17481	His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.
17482	He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.
17483	His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.
17484	It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.

17487	In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.
17488	In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.
17489	On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.
17490	CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.

17556	      IMPRESSION: Chest PA and lateral views are compared to prior  done on 9/18/2073.
17557	Paramediastinal opacification is changed.
17558	Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable.
17559	Nodular opacity in the  left perihilar region appears less apparent.
17560	No new consolidations are seen.
17561	There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC.
17562	No pneumothorax is seen .
17563	Impression:
17564	66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.
17565	The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.
17566	Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.
17567	However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.
17568	Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.
17569	While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.
17570	I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.
17571	My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.
17572	An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).
17573	Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.
17574	We recommend the following work-up:
17575	-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
17576	-Induced sputum for
17577	-PCP
17578	-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
17579	-Fungal stain and culture
17580	-Urine histo antigen
17581	-Serum cryptococcal antigen
17582	-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
17583	-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture
17584	If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.
17585	It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).
17586	Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.
17587	Thank you for this consult.
17588	Our team will follow with you

17603	HPI:
17604	Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with a history non-Hodgkins's lymphoma (spinal mass, s/p CHOP, radiation, in long term remission) and secondary MDS s/p reduced intensity allo-HSCT 12/73.
17605	His post-tx course was unremarkable.
17606	Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology.
17607	Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening, and post transplant a tree &amp; bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation.
17608	Per the patient, he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 73 and resolved on their own.
17609	He had several courses of quinolones (and other abx) during this period without significant relief, but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own.
17610	His immune suppression was d/c'd 7/74.
17611	He deveoloped iron overload (Ferritin 1356) and started phlebotomy 9/74.
17612	Mr. Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 11/74 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks.
17613	At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1-2days and be associated with malaise.
17614	He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning (not necessarily lying flat).
17615	By the end of November, the fevers were a bit higher (100.5).
17616	He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA.
17617	He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin (5d).
17618	His fevers improved.
17619	In early December, he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea.

17621	"He got another CXR which showed some ""fluid"" and was strated on lasix."
17622	He was also referred for echocardiogram, PFTs, and chest CT.  On arrival, he was found to be in AFB w/RVR.
17623	He was admitted from 12/21-01/02.
17624	He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis.
17625	Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis.
17626	Right &amp; left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically.
17627	He had 1 temperature to 101.4, and given his history he was seen by our service.

17632	CMV VL, glucan, and galactomannan were also negative.
17633	He improved w/regard to SOB but cough persisted.
17634	He was seen by Dr. Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions &amp; question of pericarditis.
17635	He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved.
17636	On February 19th, he noticed the onset of low-grade temps (100.0-100.5) with malaise and mild chills.

17747	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.
17748	In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.
17749	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.
17750	She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.
17751	She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.
17752	Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.
17753	At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.
17754	She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.
17755	She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.
17756	She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.
17757	Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.
17758	An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.
17759	She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.
17760	The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.
17761	Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.
17762	Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.
17763	She denies dysuria.
17764	The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.
17765	At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.
17766	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.
17767	Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.
17768	Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
17769	Random fingerstick glucose is 202.
17770	Extraocular movements are full.
17771	The thyroid is not enlarged.
17772	The neck veins are flat.
17773	The chest is clear to auscultation.
17774	The breasts are free of masses.
17775	There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
17776	The heart sounds are regular.
17777	There are no rubs or gallops.
17778	There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.
17779	There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.
17780	No other masses are palpable.
17781	The lower extremities are free of edema.
17782	I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.
17783	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
17784	She has not been compliant with her medications.
17785	She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.
17786	She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.
17787	She continues to consume three or four beers a day.
17788	The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.
17789	Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.
17790	Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.
17791	I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.
17792	I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
17793	q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
17794	q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
17795	q.d.
17796	She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.
17797	I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.
17798	I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.
17799	She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.
17800	An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

17812	Mrs. Trent is a pleasant 69 y/o woman with type 2 DM insulin treated.
17813	She has acknowledged difficulty following her regimen, per notes should be taking insulin BID but only takes it in am - prescribed dose NPH 30 in am and 8 at HS.
17814	Reports BG at home near 150.
17815	She is s/p L SFA and doing well from that standopoint, however developed N&V today and required NG tube placement, now better but remaoins NPO.
17816	She has been on NPH 30 in am and BG's have been 126- low 200's.

17869	- While NPO please use 1/2 day time NPH but her usual prescribed bed time dose - for now 15 nph in am and 8 at hs
17870	- Once eating can resume usual doses, may need addition of rapid action insulin with meals as well
17871	Thank you, please page Internal Medicine # 42721 with any questions.

17874	Neurology Resident ED Consult Note
17875	Patient Name:  Trent, Shirley
17876	MRN:  99210914
17877	Date:  12/08/94
17878	PCP:   Dr. Rose Irvin-Ly
17879	CC:  right sided weakness
17880	HPI:  The patient is a 70 year-old right-handed Dutch-speaking female with history of DM, PVD presenting to ED with right-sided weakness which started yesterday morning.
17881	The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.
17882	The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.
17883	She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.
17884	She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.
17885	She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.
17886	She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.
17887	She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.
17888	She has had no facial weakness.
17889	She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.
17890	She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.
17891	Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.
17892	She has had SOB today.
17893	She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.

17995	IMAGING:
17996	CT head without contrast 12/08/94:
17997	Prelim:  Mulitple regions of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, and in bilateral capsulothalamic regions as well as the left caudate/periventricular region.
17998	MRI/MRA head and neck:
17999	Not yet completed.
18000	Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:
18001	The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are
18002	"	intact."
18003	Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at
18004	"	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere."
18005	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.
18006	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.
18007	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not
18008	"	associated with significant stenosis."
18009	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum
18010	"	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the"
18011	"	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen."
18012	There is narrowing
18013	"	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of"
18014	"	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as"
18015	"	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence."
18016	Old CT brain 6/16/89:
18017	Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are
18018	"	not uncommon for a patient of this age."
18019	There are no regions of
18020	"	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction."
18021	Basal
18022	"	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar"
18023	"	infarction."
18024	No significant periventricular white matter changes are
18025	"	evident."
18026	_______________________________________________________________
18027	IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.
18028	She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).
18029	She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.
18030	Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.
18031	While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.
18032	She had persistent nausea and vomiting.
18033	Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.
18034	She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.
18035	Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.
18036	She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.
18037	She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.
18038	She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.
18039	While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.
18040	Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.
18041	RECOMMENDATIONS:
18042	1.
18043	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms
18044	2.
18045	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).
18046	3.
18047	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.
18048	Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.
18049	4.
18050	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen
18051	5.
18052	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s
18053	6.
18054	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).
18055	7.
18056	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.
18057	This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

18069	Milbank, MN 49757   
18070	Dear Dr. Pearson: 
18071	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning.
18072	Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis.
18073	She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent.
18074	Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.
18075	Interval History
18076	Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago.
18077	She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair.
18078	She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties.
18079	Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy.
18080	According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year.
18081	Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96.
18082	Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months.
18083	A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma.
18084	This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent.
18085	"She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters."
18086	Her other children have not maintained close contact.
18087	Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time.
18088	Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094.
18089	Past Medical History
18090	type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin

18133	Mild right UMN facial weakness.
18134	Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
18135	MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg.
18136	Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension).
18137	5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg.
18138	SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left.
18139	DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left.
18140	Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally.

18143	MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 
18144	CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.
18145	CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel
18146	Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.

18148	Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094.
18149	Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque.
18150	She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now.
18151	Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression.
18152	Plan
18153	1.
18154	We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
18155	2.
18156	We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control.
18157	Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
18158	3.
18159	Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy.
18160	Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl.
18161	I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time.
18162	4.
18163	I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep.
18164	After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
18165	5.
18166	Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.
18167	It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you.
18168	Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues.
18169	Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.
18170	Sincerely,

18394	Patient on Keppra in past-needed now?
18395	Will ask neurology
18396	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.
18397	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative
18398	4.
18399	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.
18400	5.

18419	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
18420	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
18421	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
18422	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
18423	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
18424	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
18425	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
18426	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
18427	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
18428	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
18429	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
18430	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
18431	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
18432	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
18433	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
18434	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
18435	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
18436	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
18437	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
18438	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
18439	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
18440	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
18441	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
18442	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
18443	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
18444	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
18445	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
18446	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
18447	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
18448	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
18449	Her abdomen is benign.
18450	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
18451	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
18452	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
18453	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
18454	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
18455	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
18456	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
18457	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
18458	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
18459	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
18460	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
18461	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
18462	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
18463	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
18464	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
18465	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
18466	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
18467	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
18468	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
18469	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
18470	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
18471	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
18472	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
18473	Sincerely,

18491	HPI: Ms. Hendricks is a 52yoF with a history of PVD and non-healing wounds of the LLE s/p redo left femoral-tibial bypass with arm vein on 5/3/78 who was discharged to home yesterday and now returns after she noted a gush of blood from her left groin wound while coughing earlier today.
18492	She was doing well until this morning when she coughed and immediately noted that her left pant leg was soaked with blood from the left groin down the left leg.
18493	When she took off her pants there was no active bleeding from the wound and she denies any light-headedness or dizziness.
18494	There has been no further bleeding from the wound and she is otherwise without complaints.

18530	She was doing well until April 2078, when she presented with a non-healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L fem-anterior tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on 5/3/78.
18531	On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.
18532	However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.
18533	On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.
18534	She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.
18535	She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.

18604	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
18605	52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.
18606	On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.
18607	In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.
18608	The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.
18609	- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin
18610	- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan
18611	- NPO from midnight, pepcid
18612	- check chem7, CBC, coags
18613	- has an insulin pump
18614	- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

18640	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.
18641	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic
18642	vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial
18643	bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity
18644	cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.
18645	She was recently treated
18646	at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,
18647	had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex.
18648	She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48
18649	hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.
18650	She has
18651	also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not
18652	had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or
18653	other symptomatology.
18654	She has also not noticed any urinary
18655	symptoms of frequency.
18656	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,
18657	hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
18658	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and
18659	fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in
18660	2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.
18661	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies
18662	tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.
18663	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,
18664	respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on
18665	room air.
18666	General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no
18667	apparent distress.
18668	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation
18669	bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
18670	Cardiovascular: 
18671	Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
18672	GI:  The
18673	abdomen is soft.
18674	The patient does have insulin pump in place,
18675	but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.
18676	Skin is warm,
18677	dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,
18678	which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the
18679	right lower extremity.
18680	This erythema stops at the ankle and does
18681	not extend up above the knee.
18682	The patient also has an open
18683	chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot
18684	as well.
18685	There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:
18686	 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased
18687	sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.
18688	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated
18689	by me and the resident.
18690	I confirm that I have seen and evaluated
18691	the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the
18692	patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
18693	disposition with the patient as well as the resident.
18694	The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.
18695	CBC showed white
18696	count of 14 with shift.
18697	LFTs were within normal limits.
18698	X-ray
18699	of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray
18700	of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.
18701	Given the
18702	erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this
18703	vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of
18704	vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed
18705	outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting
18706	her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.
18707	The patient's
18708	erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be
18709	extremely atypical for a DVT.
18710	We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is
18711	followed closely by Surgery and this notification was
18712	made at 8:30 p.m.
18713	Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point
18714	we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she
18715	does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she
18716	needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on
18717	maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the
18718	hospital.
18719	DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
18720	CONDITION:  Stable.
18721	DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

18745	3.
18746	Hyperparathyroidism.
18747	PTH level one year ago was 143.
18748	He is on calcium replacement.
18749	4.
18750	IgG monoclonal gammopathy.
18751	This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis.
18752	It was at very low levels.
18753	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Nephrocaps one q.d., and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d.
18754	by his report.
18755	REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis.
18756	No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.
18757	ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.
18758	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.
18759	Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular.
18760	Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.
18761	Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.

18770	I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.
18771	Secondary to chronic renal failure.
18772	Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy.
18773	Will recheck values and follow.
18774	5.
18775	Hypertension.
18776	A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy.
18777	He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however.
18778	I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o.
18779	q.d.

18791	KEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE
18792	NAME: Marsh, Carl
18793	MRN: 99579205
18794	Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy
18795	Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney
18796	Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T
18797	Estimated dry weight: 61 kg
18798	Dialysis access: left AVF
18799	Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night
18800	HPI: 
18801	74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.
18802	The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.
18803	The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.
18804	Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.
18805	He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.
18806	It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.
18807	The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.
18808	He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).
18809	It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.
18810	He has been symptom-free since that time.
18811	He reports no other new events.
18812	He denies any new medications.
18813	Past Medical History:

18902	ASSESSMENT:
18903	74 year old male who presents with:
18904	Myoclonus   unclear etiology without obvious precipitants; the last time this happened, it was in the setting of not getting dialyzed after three days.
18905	While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.
18906	In addition, he says that his dialysis center has been taking him off    early    a few times in the past week, though he notes that he got a full run yesterday (3    hours)
18907	chronic HD
18908	h/o MGUS   shoulder fat pads
18909	PLAN:
18910	Admit to Renal Medicine service, Dr. Tierney attending
18911	Will plan on dialysis tomorrow for two reasons: (1) high potassium, (2) see if this helps with myoclonus
18912	Will contact dialysis center tomorrow to see if any problems with his runs, and what his most recent URR or Kt/V was
18913	continue Phos-Lo 2001 tid with meals
18914	5.)
18915	Kayexalate 30 po tonight for elevated potassium
18916	Discussed with Dr. Tierney

19981	77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.
19982	At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.
19983	This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.
19984	In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.

20074	A/P: 77 yo F w/h/o DM and HTN who presented with several weeks of worsening bilateral LE burning pain exacerbated by movement and pressure.
20075	She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.
20076	Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.
20077	This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).
20078	Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.
20079	However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.

20082	- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks
20083	- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
20084	- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)
20085	Procedure: R knee aspiration
20086	Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent.
20087	The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach.
20088	1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella.
20089	A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn.
20090	A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.
20091	Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.
20092	Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

20171	Record date: 2088-02-18
20172	Reason for Visit
20173	Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.
20174	We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.
20175	He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.
20176	He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.
20177	Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.
20178	He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.
20179	His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.
20180	I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.
20181	He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.
20182	He is worried about his remaining vision.
20183	He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.
20184	She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.
20185	He also is having trouble sleeping.
20186	He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.
20187	He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.
20188	He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

20250	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
20251	reevaluate Coumadin.
20252	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
20253	77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
20254	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.
20255	Last
20256	week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
20257	It was a very very windy day.
20258	Afterwards she was outside and a
20259	huge gust of wind knocked her over.
20260	Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
20261	her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
20262	the wind blew.
20263	There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
20264	of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode.
20265	She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
20266	left eyebrow.
20267	She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
20268	CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
20269	lateral edge of her left eyebrow.
20270	She had films of her wrist and
20271	hips both of which were fine.
20272	She has bruising in these areas.
20273	Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
20274	back to normal.
20275	She had marked hypertension up to 250.
20276	She was treated with
20277	hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
20278	some hematuria.
20279	Her blood pressure at home since then has been
20280	180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.
20281	She
20282	is not on a beta-blocker currently.
20283	She has not had any episodes
20284	of chest pain.
20285	She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.
20286	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o.
20287	b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
20288	q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
20289	lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
20290	p.r.n., levothyroxine
20291	100 mg p.o.
20292	q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.
20293	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas.
20294	She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.
20295	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
20296	weight 148 pounds.
20297	GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
20298	HEENT: PERRL.
20299	Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
20300	eyebrow is easily removed.
20301	No evidence of any infection.
20302	Her
20303	left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
20304	shoulder.
20305	Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
20306	bony step-offs.
20307	She walks well with no pain in her left hip.
20308	There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
20309	bursa.
20310	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
20311	bruising but no more serious complications.
20312	Fortunately she did
20313	not have intracranial bleeding.
20314	I am not sure why her blood
20315	pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
20316	falls verses independent causes.
20317	Given that the high blood
20318	pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
20319	q.d.,
20320	and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
20321	see how well this is working.
20322	Goal BP 140-160 systolic.
20323	urine was checked today.
20324	Hematuria has resolved.
20325	She has 2+
20326	proteinuria.
20327	I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
20328	her hypertension.
20329	We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
20330	and benefits of Coumadin therapy.
20331	Although she is at risk for
20332	falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
20333	Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke.
20334	She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
20335	that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke.
20336	I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
20337	hemorrhage and its consequences.
20338	I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
20339	month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
20340	working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
20341	increased risk for falls.
20342	It seems to me that she is in a gray
20343	area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
20344	for Coumadin for her.
20345	She feels very strongly that she wishes to
20346	continue.
20347	This was discussed in detail with her and her
20348	daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.
20349	I
20350	encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
20351	strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall.
20352	More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
20353	counseling and education.

20362	"Betty has been doing ""okay"" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability."
20363	She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.
20364	Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.
20365	She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.
20366	She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.

20376	>90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.
20377	70-75% LICA.
20378	The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.

20426	Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.
20427	She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.
20428	Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.
20429	Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.
20430	Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.
20431	This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.
20432	Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.
20433	Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.
20434	She is unable to tandem gait.
20435	Impression:
20436	Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
20437	She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.
20438	Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.
20439	My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.
20440	I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.
20441	I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.
20442	I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.
20443	I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.
20444	I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.
20445	Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.
20446	I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.
20447	This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.
20448	While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

20729	DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
20730	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
20731	The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
20732	In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
20733	There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
20734	This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.
20735	The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
20736	She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.
20737	The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
20738	She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
20739	The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
20740	Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
20741	Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.
20742	There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
20743	On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.
20744	MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
20745	The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
20746	MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
20747	Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
20748	Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
20749	It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
20750	Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
20751	Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
20752	There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
20753	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
20754	The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
20755	There are no medication allergies reported.
20756	PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.
20757	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.
20758	Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.
20759	She uses alcohol occasionally.
20760	She has a 12th grade education.
20761	She lives alone and is a widow.
20762	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.
20763	The patient is overweight.
20764	Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
20765	Weight is 217 pounds.
20766	Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.
20767	Poor neck posture is noted.
20768	Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
20769	Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.
20770	Temporal arteries are normal.
20771	Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
20772	Romberg is negative.
20773	Tandem gait is normal.
20774	The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
20775	There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
20776	This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
20777	There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
20778	NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.
20779	Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.
20780	Extraocular movements are full.
20781	Visual fields are intact.
20782	There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.
20783	Hearing is intact.
20784	Oropharynx is normal.
20785	Palate elevates well.
20786	Tongue is midline.
20787	Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
20788	Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
20789	There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
20790	Coordination testing today seemed intact.
20791	Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
20792	Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.
20793	Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.
20794	IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.
20795	Comment.
20796	I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
20797	I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
20798	Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
20799	In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
20800	It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
20801	PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
20802	She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
20803	We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
20804	We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
20805	It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.
20806	For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
20807	I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
20808	She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
20809	We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

22912	HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.
22913	In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.
22914	After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.
22915	Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.
22916	Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.
22917	He received 21 days of flagyl.
22918	After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.
22919	Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.
22920	He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.
22921	One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.
22922	At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.
22923	Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.
22924	He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.

23083	Quick
23084	"ATCH: 		655-75-45"
23085	Dear Harry and Yair:
23086	My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
23087	As you know, she is just 52 years of age.
23088	Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.
23089	She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
23090	She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
23091	She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
23092	On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.
23093	This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.
23094	In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
23095	There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
23096	She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
23097	By last spring, i.e.
23098	a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
23099	She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
23100	Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
23101	Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.
23102	Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???
23103	length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
23104	Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
23105	She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
23106	She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
23107	On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.
23108	Pulse was 70 and regular.
23109	Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
23110	She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.
23111	There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
23112	She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
23113	This is of course a very unhappy situation.
23114	Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
23115	However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
23116	I would suggest the following.
23117	Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.
23118	Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
23119	She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
23120	If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
23121	I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
23122	My thanks once again.
23123	With every best wish.
23124	Sincerely,
23125	Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

23309	cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg
23310	HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.
23311	Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.
23312	Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.
23313	She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.
23314	She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.
23315	She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.
23316	Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.
23317	She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.
23318	She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).
23319	She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).
23320	She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

23447	Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine
23448	693-31-18-1
23449	I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.
23450	The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.
23451	He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.
23452	In August he suffered a stroke.
23453	He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.
23454	He recalls no problem with his vision.
23455	He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.
23456	He does no know the extent of the evaluation.
23457	He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.
23458	He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.
23459	His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.
23460	He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.
23461	He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.
23462	The dizziness is worst in the morning.
23463	He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.
23464	He has DM and HTN.
23465	He is a nonsmoker.
23466	I don't have cholesterol information.
23467	There is no history of cardiac disease.
23468	There is no history of alcohol abuse.
23469	He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.
23470	He has no known allergies.
23471	He is aware of no significant family history.
23472	He is married.
23473	He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.
23474	He came to america from Honduras in 2073.
23475	He worked nights in construction until his stroke.
23476	Pulse 66, regular.
23477	BP 186/110.
23478	There are no cranial bruits.
23479	The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.
23480	The lungs are clear.
23481	The heart is regular with no murmur.
23482	The abdomen is benign.
23483	The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.
23484	He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.
23485	His fluency in his native language is probably normal.
23486	Cranial nerves are intact.
23487	There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.
23488	(He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)
23489	Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.
23490	The tone is only mildly increased.
23491	Sensation is intact.
23492	Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).
23493	The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.
23494	Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.
23495	He wears a right AFO.
23496	He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.
23497	His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.
23498	This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.
23499	He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.
23500	Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.
23501	To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.
23502	I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.
23503	He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.
23504	He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.
23505	I asked him to return here in a month to review this.
23506	Sincerely,
23507	Patrick Winn, M.D.

23650	CXR: clear
23651	CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts
23652	"CTA: pending	"
23653	"MRI/MRA:	pending"
23654	Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms.
23655	Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait.
23656	Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits.
23657	However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.
23658	Plan:   
23659	-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis
23660	Check MRI brain stroke protocol
23661	Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180
23662	Control hyperglycemia
23663	If stroke present, admit to Neurology.
23664	R/O MI
23665	Discussed with Dr. Costello.
23666	Thank you for this interesting consult.

23674	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.
23675	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
23676	woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
23677	hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
23678	06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.
23679	She
23680	presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
23681	normal.
23682	Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.
23683	She was admitted to
23684	the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.
23685	Her imaging studies
23686	showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
23687	of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
23688	in addition to a left ICA occlusion.
23689	She was taken to angiogram
23690	for interventional neuroradiology.
23691	She had an angiogram.
23692	Radiology felt they were unable to access the
23693	cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
23694	admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
23695	hypertensive therapy.
23696	She remained stable anti-coagulated on
23697	heparin.
23698	During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
23699	to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
23700	be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
23701	remain anti-coagulated.
23702	She was discharged to rehab and
23703	subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.
23704	At home, she
23705	had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
23706	feeling O.K.
23707	VNA sees her once a week.
23708	At rehab, for unclear
23709	reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
23710	discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
23711	done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
23712	unaware of any such problems.
23713	She continues to get PT and
23714	occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
23715	remains poor.
23716	According to the family member and her daughter
23717	who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
23718	to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
23719	decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
23720	to communicate well with her.
23721	Since her discharge, she has not
23722	had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
23723	changes.
23724	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
23725	chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
23726	claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
23727	heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
23728	diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
23729	rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
23730	or bleeding problems.
23731	Review of neurological systems as above.

23739	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
23740	rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.
23741	General:  Pleasant woman in
23742	no acute distress.
23743	HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
23744	anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.
23745	There is no thyromegaly.
23746	Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.
23747	Heart:  Regular rate
23748	and rhythm.
23749	Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
23750	Abdomen:  Has good
23751	bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
23752	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
23753	Skin:  No rashes
23754	or ulcers.
23755	Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
23756	interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.
23757	She is attentive.
23758	is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.
23759	She has
23760	decreased naming and decreased comprehension.
23761	She does not have
23762	any neglect or apraxia.
23763	Registration is 3/4.
23764	Short-term memory
23765	is 0/4 in 5 minutes.
23766	Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
23767	Fundi are normal.
23768	Extraocular movements are intact with
23769	nystagmus.
23770	Visual fields are full to confrontation.
23771	She has a
23772	right facial droop.
23773	Facial sensation is intact.
23774	Hearing is
23775	Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
23776	arm and leg.
23777	She has strength on the left is normal.
23778	On the
23779	right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
23780	left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.
23781	reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm.
23782	There is no ataxia on the left.
23783	Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
23784	and so conducts the right leg.
23785	Her reflexes are brisker on the
23786	right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.
23787	IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
23788	acute stroke or hemorrhage.
23789	On the CT, there was a question of a
23790	left MI cutoff.
23791	CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
23792	stenosis with minimal distal interflow.
23793	MRI of the brain showed
23794	a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
23795	the caudate basal ganglia.
23796	She has had mild to moderate chronic
23797	small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.
23798	Echo showed a normal
23799	EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.
23800	IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
23801	vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
23802	with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
23803	infarct.
23804	On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
23805	comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.
23806	It
23807	is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
23808	stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
23809	during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
23810	anti-coagulation therapy.
23811	I have asked her to get a follow up
23812	PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
23813	any contraindications to anti-coagulation.
23814	If there are no such
23815	contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.
23816	In addition,
23817	her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
23818	her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d.
23819	and to maintain a
23820	blood pressure diary.
23821	RECOMMENDATIONS:
23822	1.
23823	Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
23824	t.i.d.
23825	2.
23826	Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
23827	3.
23828	Continue risk factor modification with the management of
23829	blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
23830	4.
23831	PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
23832	stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
23833	per the PCP.
23834	5.
23835	Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
23836	training and language rehab.
23837	6.
23838	Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
23839	problems.
23840	More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
23841	and counseling.

23934	72 year-old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow-up.
23935	She has had a significant recovery.
23936	Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.
23937	Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them.
23938	She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well.
23939	She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this.

24264	Roger L. Albright, M.D.
24265	Columbia Kingwood Medical Center
24266	57 Wood St, Q6-24
24267	North Andover, KY  41454
24268	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.
24269	The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.
24270	In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.
24271	The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.
24272	There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
24273	The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.
24274	Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.
24275	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.
24276	She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.
24277	MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
24278	She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.
24279	SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.
24280	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.
24281	Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.
24282	The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
24283	Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.
24284	There is no murmur.
24285	The abdomen is soft and nontender.
24286	The liver is not palpably enlarged.
24287	The extremities are warm without edema.
24288	Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.
24289	There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
24290	There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.
24291	Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.
24292	Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.
24293	In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.
24294	Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.
24295	We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.
24296	There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.
24297	Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.
24298	Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.
24299	Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

24598	"Chief Complaint	"
24599	Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 
24600	"History of Present Illness	"
24601	I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM.
24602	BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD
24603	Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it.
24604	The pharmacy didn't give it to her.
24605	Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.
24606	Feels well.
24607	Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.
24608	Denies CP, SOB, palpitations
24609	Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her.
24610	Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.
24611	Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass.
24612	Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI.
24613	She had it done few 9/86.

24827	I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.
24828	I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.
24829	Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.
24830	I would only add/emphasize the following:
24831	Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 
24832	h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
24833	Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
24834	Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
24835	Pneumonia several times in the past 
24836	Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
24837	Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
24838	Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
24839	Elevated lipids - on statin 
24840	Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.)
24841	Kidney stones 
24842	Patent foramen ovale
24843	He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.
24844	He has improved with heart rate control.
24845	Exam
24846	VS - as noted
24847	General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.
24848	Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.
24849	CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
24850	Lungs - clear
24851	Abdomen - obese
24852	Extremities - minimal edema
24853	Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.
24854	Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.
24855	Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.
24856	Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.
24857	"I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission."
24858	Recommendations:  
24859	Increase metoprolol dose.
24860	May need Toprol XL 100 BID.
24861	Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.
24862	Filter all IVs (PFO)
24863	PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
24864	Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

24894	He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load.
24895	Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help.
24896	Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic.
24897	EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec).

24970	The heart rate is 90
24971	and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds
24972	less than last year.
24973	Random blood glucose was 224.
24974	The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071.
24975	She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms
24976	suggestive of TIA.
24977	The patient has a past history of
24978	hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.
24979	She has
24980	not been hypothyroid since then.
24981	In fact, the last TSH
24982	level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her
24983	departure to Ghana.
24984	She denies heat intolerance as well
24985	as palpitations.
24986	On physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute
24987	distress.
24988	The neck veins are flat.
24989	The extraocular
24990	movements are full.
24991	There are no symptoms of
24992	hyperthyroidism.
24993	The chest is clear to auscultation.
24994	The
24995	heart sounds are regular.
24996	There are no rubs or gallops.
24997	The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are
24998	free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require
24999	attention.
25000	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
25001	history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131
25002	with good results who, last year before she left the
25003	country, had a subnormal TSH.
25004	She does not have obvious
25005	symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
25006	repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.
25007	Diabetes continues to be a problem.
25008	Glycemic control
25009	continues to be difficult to achieve.
25010	Today, I have
25011	reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o.
25012	q.d.
25013	The son is going
25014	to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
25015	is not taking this medicine at this point.
25016	The other
25017	medications were continued.
25018	It is indeed possible that she
25019	will need insulin in the near future.
25020	I plan close followup
25021	and will see her again in six weeks' time.
25022	If she is
25023	hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in
25024	achieving glycemic control.
25025	Against this is the high
25026	cholesterol.
25027	She used to be on Lipitor, which was
25028	discontinued during her trip to Ghana.
25029	I have
25030	reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o.
25031	I have also
25032	added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o.
25033	to protect
25034	her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

25107	Pt was seen last week by Dr.Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna.
25108	I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed Glyburide, Actos and Insulin.
25109	The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  Metformin because of GI intolerance and her regimen was Insulin only.
25110	She did not keep subsequent appointments.
25111	She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis/UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin.
25112	She has now completed the treatment.
