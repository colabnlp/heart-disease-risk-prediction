149	0	a	Past medical records.
150	0	a	History of Present Illness  
151	0	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
152	0	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
153	0	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
154	0	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
155	0	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
156	0	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
157	0	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
158	0	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
159	0	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
160	0	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
161	0	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
162	0	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
163	0	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
164	0	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.

166	0	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
167	0	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
168	0	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
169	0	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
170	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
171	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
172	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
173	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
174	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
175	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
176	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
177	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
178	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
179	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
180	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
181	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
182	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
183	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).

370	0	a	I/P: 
371	0	a	73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
372	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
373	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
374	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
375	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
376	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
377	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
378	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
379	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
380	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

389	0	a	"g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea."
390	0	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
391	0	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
392	0	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
393	0	a	hypoglycemia).
394	0	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
395	0	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
396	0	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
397	0	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
398	0	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
399	0	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
400	0	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
401	0	a	b.
402	0	a	Check orthostatics daily.
403	0	a	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.

513	0	a	Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:
514	0	a	NPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast
515	0	a	Regular 10+ scale qPM before  supper
516	0	a	NPH 30 at bedtime
517	0	a	QID Regular sliding scale
518	0	a	These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
519	0	a	I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
520	0	a	I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
521	0	a	Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
522	0	a	He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency.
523	0	a	If you agree, would start iron repletion.
524	0	a	(Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)

830	0	a	Reason for visit:
831	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
832	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
833	0	a	Interval History:
834	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
835	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
836	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
837	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
838	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
839	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
840	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
841	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
842	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
843	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
844	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
845	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
846	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
847	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
848	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
849	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
850	0	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
851	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
852	0	a	Lasix 20mg
853	0	a	Toprol XL 50mg
854	0	a	ASA 325mg
855	0	a	Zestril 20mg
856	0	a	Lantus 10 units hs
857	0	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
858	0	a	Multivitamin
859	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
860	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
861	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

877	0	a	   She and her husband are doing well.
878	0	a	She has retired.
879	0	a	Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.
880	0	a	Review of systems:
881	0	a	   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.
882	0	a	Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.
883	0	a	Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.
884	0	a	Physical examination:

899	0	a	EKG:
900	0	a	   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.
901	0	a	Impression:
902	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
903	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
904	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
905	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
906	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
907	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
908	0	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
909	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.

1110	0	a	Dear Dr. Mcmahon:
1111	0	a	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.
1112	3	a	He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.
1113	0	a	Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.
1114	0	a	The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.
1115	0	a	The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.
1116	0	a	There were no complications.
1117	0	a	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.
1118	0	a	His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.
1119	0	a	Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.
1120	0	a	Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.
1121	0	a	He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
1122	0	a	He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.
1123	0	a	His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.
1124	0	a	He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.
1125	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.
1126	0	a	Please call if you have questions.

1681	0	a	MRN: 9190908
1682	0	a	Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    
1683	0	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
1684	0	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
1685	0	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
1686	0	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
1687	0	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
1688	0	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
1689	0	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
1690	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
1691	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
1692	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
1693	0	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
1694	0	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
1695	0	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
1696	0	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
1697	0	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
1698	0	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
1699	0	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
1700	0	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
1701	0	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
1702	0	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
1703	0	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
1704	0	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
1705	0	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
1706	0	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
1707	0	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
1708	0	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
1709	0	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
1710	0	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
1711	0	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
1712	0	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
1713	0	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
1714	0	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
1715	0	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
1716	0	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
1717	0	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
1718	0	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
1719	0	a	He is unable to work.
1720	0	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
1721	0	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
1722	0	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
1723	0	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
1724	0	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
1725	0	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
1726	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
1727	0	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
1728	0	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
1729	0	a	His hair has now grown back.
1730	0	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
1731	0	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
1732	0	a	Eye contact is good.
1733	0	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
1734	0	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
1735	0	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
1736	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
1737	0	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
1738	0	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
1739	0	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
1740	0	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
1741	0	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
1742	0	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
1743	0	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
1744	0	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
1745	0	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
1746	0	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
1747	0	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
1748	0	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
1749	0	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
1750	0	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
1751	0	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
1752	0	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
1753	0	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
1754	0	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
1755	0	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
1756	0	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
1757	0	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
1758	0	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
1759	0	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
1760	0	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
1761	0	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

1851	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective.
1852	0	a	She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years.
1853	0	a	She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago.
1854	0	a	"She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved."

1925	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
1926	0	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
1927	0	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
1928	0	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
1929	0	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
1930	0	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
1931	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

2351	0	a	Imaging:
2352	0	a	Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.
2353	0	a	No acute intracranial process.
2354	0	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
2355	3	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
2356	0	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
2357	0	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
2358	0	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
2359	0	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
2360	0	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
2361	0	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
2362	0	a	Recommendations:
2363	0	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
2364	0	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
2365	0	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
2366	0	a	-Continue statin.
2367	0	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

2687	0	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
2688	0	a	History of Present Illness
2689	0	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
2690	0	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
2691	0	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
2692	0	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
2693	0	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
2694	0	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
2695	0	a	There was no PCI option available.
2696	0	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
2697	0	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
2698	0	a	He now presented for cath.
2699	0	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
2700	0	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
2701	0	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
2702	0	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
2703	0	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
2704	0	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
2705	0	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
2706	0	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
2707	0	a	He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

2998	0	a	CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.
2999	0	a	He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).

3104	0	a	Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.
3105	0	a	I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies.
3106	0	a	Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment.
3107	0	a	For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.
3108	0	a	Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.
3109	0	a	At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

3562	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
3563	3	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
3564	0	a	She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.
3565	0	a	##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
3566	0	a	Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.
3567	0	a	A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
3568	0	a	Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.
3569	0	a	Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
3570	0	a	Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.
3571	0	a	Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
3572	0	a	Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
3573	0	a	Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
3574	0	a	Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion
3575	0	a	Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
3576	0	a	##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
3577	0	a	Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.
3578	0	a	Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
3579	0	a	Check orthostatics
3580	0	a	Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.
3581	0	a	Monitor on telemetry.
3582	0	a	Physical therapy consult.
3583	0	a	##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.
3584	0	a	Fe, TIBC, ferritin
3585	0	a	Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia
3586	0	a	##: Elevated anion gap.
3587	0	a	Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.
3588	0	a	Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.
3589	0	a	There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.
3590	0	a	pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.
3591	0	a	AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).
3592	0	a	Check lactate
3593	0	a	Repeat AG
3594	0	a	##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.
3595	0	a	UA and CXR were negative.
3596	0	a	If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.
3597	0	a	Repeat CBC
3598	0	a	##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide
3599	0	a	Finger sticks AC with RISS
3600	0	a	##: Schizophrenia &#8211; continue trilafon
3601	0	a	##: Insomnia &#8211; continue seroquel, ambient

4175	0	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
4176	0	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
4177	0	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
4178	0	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
4179	0	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
4180	0	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
4181	0	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
4182	0	a	Will discuss with Drs.
4183	0	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
4184	0	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
4185	0	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
4186	0	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
4187	0	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
4188	0	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
4189	0	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
4190	0	a	Follow sugars while in house
4191	0	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

4479	0	a	Dear Fitzgerald:
4480	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
4481	0	a	As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
4482	0	a	At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.
4483	0	a	The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
4484	0	a	The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.
4485	0	a	There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
4486	0	a	He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
4487	0	a	At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
4488	0	a	That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.
4489	0	a	The right side was patent.
4490	0	a	With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.
4491	0	a	The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
4492	0	a	The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.
4493	0	a	Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
4494	0	a	There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
4495	0	a	The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
4496	0	a	He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.
4497	0	a	The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
4498	0	a	He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
4499	0	a	Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.
4500	0	a	This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
4501	0	a	The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
4502	0	a	He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.
4503	0	a	Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
4504	0	a	He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
4505	0	a	He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.
4506	0	a	The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
4507	0	a	His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
4508	0	a	He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
4509	0	a	He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.
4510	0	a	Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
4511	0	a	He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
4512	0	a	He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.
4513	0	a	Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
4514	0	a	"Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
4515	0	a	At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.
4516	0	a	Past medical history:
4517	0	a	   As above.

4589	0	a	Other Data:
4590	0	a	   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
4591	0	a	Assessment and plan:
4592	0	a	   1.
4593	0	a	Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.
4594	0	a	This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
4595	0	a	I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.
4596	0	a	Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
4597	0	a	We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
4598	0	a	I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.
4599	0	a	Impression:
4600	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.
4601	0	a	We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.
4602	0	a	Right leg has not been examined in the past.
4603	0	a	Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.
4604	0	a	Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
4605	0	a	Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
4606	0	a	Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
4607	0	a	If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.
4608	0	a	He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.
4609	0	a	Coronary artery disease - stable.
4610	0	a	Diabetes.
4611	0	a	Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

5090	0	a	He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.
5091	0	a	He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped.
5092	0	a	He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages.
5093	0	a	During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious.
5094	0	a	He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication.
5095	0	a	Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
5096	0	a	Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.
5097	0	a	Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.

5223	0	a	ASSESSMENT
5224	0	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
5225	0	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
5226	0	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
5227	0	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
5228	0	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
5229	0	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
5230	0	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
5231	0	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
5232	0	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
5233	0	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
5234	3	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
5235	0	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
5236	0	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
5237	0	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
5238	0	a	PLAN
5239	0	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
5240	0	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
5241	0	a	-D/c naproxen use.
5242	0	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
5243	0	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
5244	0	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.

5246	0	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

5333	0	a	Rule out 
5334	0	a	osteoporosis.
5335	0	a	HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
5336	0	a	diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.
5337	0	a	At 
5338	0	a	the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
5339	0	a	Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
5340	0	a	but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
5341	0	a	approximately 26 weeks.
5342	0	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
5343	0	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
5344	0	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
5345	0	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
5346	0	a	Subsequently he 
5347	0	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
5348	0	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
5349	0	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.
5350	0	a	He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
5351	0	a	100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
5352	0	a	Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.
5353	0	a	The patient's 
5354	0	a	complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.
5355	0	a	There is 
5356	0	a	no peripheral neuropathy.
5357	0	a	There is no autonomic neuropathy.
5358	0	a	No retinal 
5359	0	a	disease.
5360	0	a	However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
5361	0	a	creatinine currently of 2.4.
5362	0	a	Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
5363	0	a	symptoms in the early 80s.
5364	0	a	By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
5365	0	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
5366	0	a	2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
5367	0	a	infarctions.
5368	0	a	In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
5369	0	a	transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.
5370	0	a	Since 
5371	0	a	that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
5372	0	a	with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
5373	0	a	degree of symptoms.
5374	0	a	The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
5375	0	a	day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.
5376	0	a	Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
5377	0	a	twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
5378	0	a	mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.
5379	0	a	Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
5380	0	a	was from a trauma some years ago.
5381	0	a	Other past medical history includes

5470	0	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
5471	0	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
5472	0	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
5473	0	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
5474	0	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
5475	0	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
5476	0	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
5477	0	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
5478	0	a	patients.
5479	0	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
5480	0	a	this makes sense.
5481	0	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
5482	0	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
5483	0	a	reasons.
5484	0	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
5485	0	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
5486	0	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
5487	0	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
5488	0	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
5489	0	a	We would be a little 
5490	0	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
5491	0	a	without more information about this patient.
5492	0	a	The patient's diabetes 
5493	0	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
5494	0	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
5495	0	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
5496	0	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
5497	0	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
5498	0	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
5499	0	a	situation.
5500	0	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

5565	3	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
5566	0	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
5567	0	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
5568	0	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
5569	0	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
5570	0	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
5571	0	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
5572	0	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
5573	0	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
5574	0	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
5575	0	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
5576	0	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
5577	0	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
5578	0	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
5579	0	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
5580	0	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
5581	0	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.

5770	0	a	PLAN:
5771	0	a	1.
5772	0	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
5773	0	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
5774	0	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
5775	0	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
5776	0	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
5777	0	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
5778	0	a	2.
5779	0	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
5780	0	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
5781	0	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
5782	0	a	3.
5783	0	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
5784	0	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
5785	0	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
5786	0	a	4.
5787	0	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
5788	0	a	5.
5789	0	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
5790	0	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

5795	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
5796	0	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
5797	0	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
5798	0	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
5799	0	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
5800	0	a	His options are:
5801	0	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
5802	0	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
5803	0	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
5804	0	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

5891	0	a	Reason for Visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
5892	0	a	Stage IVB 
5893	0	a	Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 
5894	0	a	Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 
5895	0	a	History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.
5896	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
5897	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
5898	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
5899	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
5900	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
5901	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
5902	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
5903	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
5904	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
5905	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
5906	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
5907	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
5908	0	a	He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.

5963	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
5964	0	a	72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer.
5965	0	a	He is doing quite well.
5966	0	a	Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss.
5967	0	a	After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging.
5968	0	a	If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment.
5969	0	a	If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards.
5970	0	a	He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.
5971	0	a	RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

5981	0	a	To Whom It May Concern:
5982	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
5983	0	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
5984	0	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
5985	0	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
5986	0	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
5987	0	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
5988	0	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
5989	0	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
5990	0	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
5991	0	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
5992	0	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
5993	0	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
5994	0	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
5995	3	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.
5996	0	a	Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
5997	0	a	daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
5998	0	a	daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
5999	0	a	daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o.
6000	0	a	daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
6001	0	a	daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o.
6002	0	a	daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
6003	0	a	daily.
6004	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
6005	0	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
6006	0	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
6007	0	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
6008	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
6009	0	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
6010	0	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
6011	0	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
6012	0	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
6013	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
6014	0	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
6015	0	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
6016	0	a	He has good distal pulsations.
6017	0	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
6018	0	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
6019	0	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
6020	0	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
6021	0	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
6022	0	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
6023	0	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
6024	0	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
6025	0	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
6026	0	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
6027	0	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
6028	0	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
6029	0	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
6030	0	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
6031	0	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
6032	0	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
6033	0	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
6034	0	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
6035	0	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
6036	0	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
6037	0	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
6038	0	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
6039	0	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
6040	0	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
6041	0	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
6042	0	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
6043	0	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
6044	0	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
6045	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
6046	0	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
6047	0	a	Thank you.
6048	0	a	Sincerely,

6633	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
6634	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
6635	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
6636	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
6637	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
6638	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
6639	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

6687	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
6688	3	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
6689	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
6690	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
6691	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
6692	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
6693	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
6694	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
6695	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
6696	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
6697	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
6698	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
6699	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
6700	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
6701	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
6702	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
6703	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
6704	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
6705	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

7466	0	a	man who I have not seen since November of 2088.
7467	0	a	Approximately
7468	0	a	four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.
7469	0	a	He saw colored
7470	0	a	spots floating in his visual field.
7471	0	a	He has been noting some
7472	0	a	decreased depth perception and visual acuity.
7473	0	a	At the same time,
7474	0	a	he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he
7475	0	a	believes were migraines.
7476	0	a	He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.

7478	0	a	Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits.
7479	0	a	However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which
7480	0	a	came back at 10.2.
7481	0	a	Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I
7482	0	a	had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

7485	0	a	never returned for that testing.

7527	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
7528	0	a	1.
7529	0	a	Diabetes.
7530	0	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
7531	0	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
7532	0	a	diabetes.
7533	0	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to
7534	0	a	start him on metformin 500 mg p.o.

7536	0	a	were reviewed.
7537	0	a	He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and
7538	0	a	fasting lipid profile checked today.
7539	0	a	Unfortunately, he was not
7540	0	a	actually fasting.
7541	0	a	He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and
7542	0	a	Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education.
7543	0	a	He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.
7544	0	a	He is asked
7545	0	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
7546	0	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens
7547	0	a	swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.
7548	0	a	I assume that this
7549	0	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.
7550	0	a	was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job
7551	0	a	until his symptoms clear.
7552	0	a	2.
7553	0	a	Migraines.
7554	0	a	The patient does sound as if he is also having
7555	0	a	migraines.
7556	0	a	We will address this at future visits.

8008	0	a	PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.
8009	0	a	We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.
8010	0	a	Will check ESR today.
8011	0	a	Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.
8012	0	a	Depression:  She seems better.
8013	0	a	Continue Effexor.
8014	0	a	Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.
8015	0	a	Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.
8016	0	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.
8017	0	a	Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.
8018	0	a	Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.
8019	0	a	Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
8020	0	a	Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
8021	0	a	Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
8022	0	a	Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
8023	0	a	DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
8024	3	a	Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
8025	0	a	Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
8026	0	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
8027	0	a	Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.
8028	0	a	11.
8029	0	a	Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

8294	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4
8295	0	a	Dear Usha:
8296	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in
8297	0	a	my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary
8298	0	a	artery bypass surgery.
8299	0	a	As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a
8300	0	a	terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest
8301	0	a	discomfort.
8302	0	a	One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was
8303	0	a	fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.
8304	0	a	Both of
8305	0	a	these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.
8306	0	a	I
8307	0	a	am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier
8308	0	a	Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her
8309	0	a	test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.
8310	0	a	Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.
8311	0	a	She
8312	0	a	continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking
8313	0	a	corticosteroid shots for that.
8314	0	a	On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly
8315	0	a	woman.
8316	0	a	Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.
8317	0	a	Jugular venous
8318	0	a	pulse is not observed.
8319	0	a	She has bilateral carotid bruits.
8320	0	a	Chest
8321	0	a	exam is clear.
8322	0	a	Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a
8323	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
8324	0	a	sternal border.
8325	0	a	Abdominal exam is benign.
8326	0	a	Peripheral exam shows
8327	0	a	trace pedal edema.
8328	0	a	EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute.
8329	0	a	There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old
8330	0	a	anterolateral MI.
8331	0	a	The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared
8332	0	a	with previous tracings.
8333	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085
8334	0	a	IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a
8335	0	a	Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.
8336	0	a	If she can
8337	0	a	exercise on this test, that would be even better.
8338	0	a	When the
8339	0	a	results are back, I will get back you regarding further
8340	0	a	recommendations.
8341	0	a	My hope is that we will not have to
8342	0	a	revascularize her again.
8343	0	a	If we do, I am hoping to do so with
8344	0	a	potential angioplasty and stenting.
8345	0	a	In the meantime, I have
8346	0	a	switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes
8347	0	a	of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100.
8348	1	a	Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.
8349	0	a	I also suggested to her in
8350	0	a	the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know
8351	0	a	the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of
8352	0	a	her steroid injection for her back.
8353	0	a	Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
8354	0	a	regarding this patient.
8355	0	a	Again, thank you for referring her to
8356	0	a	our clinic.
8357	0	a	With warm regards,

8371	0	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
8372	0	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
8373	0	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
8374	0	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
8375	0	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
8376	0	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
8377	0	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
8378	0	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
8379	0	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
8380	0	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
8381	0	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
8382	0	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
8383	3	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
8384	0	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
8385	0	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
8386	0	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
8387	0	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
8388	0	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
8389	0	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
8390	0	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
8391	0	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
8392	0	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
8393	0	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
8394	0	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
8395	0	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
8396	0	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
8397	0	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
8398	0	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
8399	0	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
8400	0	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
8401	0	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
8402	0	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
8403	0	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
8404	0	a	Chest is clear.
8405	0	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
8406	0	a	PMI is normal.
8407	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
8408	0	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
8409	0	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
8410	0	a	The abdomen is obese.
8411	0	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
8412	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
8413	0	a	Distal pulses are normal.
8414	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
8415	0	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
8416	0	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
8417	0	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
8418	0	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
8419	0	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
8420	0	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
8421	0	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
8422	0	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
8423	0	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
8424	0	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
8425	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
8426	0	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
8427	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
8428	0	a	Kindest personal regards.

8958	0	a	NAME:     Wilson, Gabriel
8959	0	a	MRN:     8514931
8960	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian
8961	0	a	female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness.
8962	0	a	Her daughter,
8963	0	a	who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today.
8964	0	a	Apparently, for
8965	0	a	"many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled"""
8966	0	a	when she walks.
8967	0	a	This never occurs when lying down or sitting.
8968	0	a	It is only when she is
8969	0	a	walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or
8970	0	a	backward.
8971	0	a	At times, she does visibly veer when she walks.
8972	0	a	She has had one fall a
8973	0	a	number of months ago when she broke her wrist.
8974	0	a	She has not had any subsequent
8975	0	a	falls.
8976	0	a	There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,
8977	0	a	numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache.
8978	0	a	She actually
8979	0	a	feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it
8980	0	a	was a little more severe.
8981	0	a	Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.
8982	0	a	Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.
8983	0	a	Review of other systems notable for general fatigue.
8984	0	a	Otherwise unremarkable.
8985	0	a	No
8986	0	a	chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
8987	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

8991	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.
8992	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece.
8993	0	a	She neither drinks nor
8994	0	a	smokes.
8995	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,
8996	0	a	72-year-old female.
8997	0	a	BP 140/84.
8998	0	a	Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,
8999	0	a	except for decreased hearing on the left.
9000	0	a	On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift.
9001	0	a	Good
9002	0	a	power throughout upper and lower extremities.
9003	0	a	She does, however, seem mildly
9004	0	a	bradykinetic diffusely.
9005	0	a	Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric.
9006	0	a	Amplitude
9007	0	a	is normal for finger tapping.
9008	0	a	Power in the lower extremities 5/5.
9009	0	a	Sensory exam with
9010	0	a	mild vibratory loss in the toes.
9011	0	a	Finger-to-nose testing intact.
9012	0	a	Foot-tapping decreased
9013	0	a	bilaterally.
9014	0	a	Romberg sway.
9015	0	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to
9016	0	a	either side.
9017	0	a	She is unable to perform tandem.
9018	0	a	DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+
9019	0	a	ankle jerks.
9020	0	a	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
9021	0	a	DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter
9022	0	a	hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral
9023	0	a	pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right
9024	0	a	internal capsule and bilateral thalami.
9025	0	a	Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the
9026	0	a	anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the
9027	0	a	posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment
9028	0	a	stenosis of the basilar artery.
9029	0	a	Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134.
9030	0	a	8/30
9031	0	a	bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits.
9032	0	a	LFT's normal except SGOT
9033	0	a	elevated at 46.
9034	0	a	IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and
9035	0	a	hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady.
9036	0	a	She is
9037	0	a	symptomatic only when she walks.
9038	0	a	Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
9039	0	a	toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the
9040	0	a	wide-based, at times veering gait.
9041	0	a	It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are
9042	0	a	multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.
9043	0	a	It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given
9044	0	a	that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she
9045	0	a	is concerned about.
9046	0	a	However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,
9047	0	a	she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she
9048	0	a	became hypotensive.
9049	0	a	As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding
9050	0	a	Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she
9051	0	a	can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine.
9052	0	a	I will see her in follow up in two
9053	0	a	months to see how she is doing.
9054	0	a	May also consider checking CBC, given her
9055	0	a	symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

9069	0	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
9070	0	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
9071	0	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
9072	0	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
9073	0	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
9074	0	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
9075	0	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
9076	0	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
9077	0	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
9078	0	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
9079	0	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
9080	0	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
9081	0	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
9082	0	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
9083	0	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
9084	0	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
9085	0	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
9086	3	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
9087	0	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
9088	0	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
9089	0	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
9090	0	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
9091	0	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
9092	0	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
9093	0	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
9094	0	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
9095	0	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
9096	0	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
9097	0	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
9098	0	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
9099	0	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
9100	0	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
9101	0	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
9102	0	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
9103	0	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
9104	0	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
9105	0	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
9106	0	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
9107	0	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
9108	0	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
9109	0	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
9110	0	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
9111	0	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
9112	0	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
9113	0	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
9114	0	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
9115	0	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
9116	0	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
9117	0	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
9118	0	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
9119	0	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
9120	0	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
9121	0	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
9122	0	a	Sincerely,
9123	0	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

9604	0	a	Assessment and plan:
9605	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.
9606	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
9607	0	a	Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.
9608	0	a	We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.
9609	0	a	If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.
9610	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

10425	0	a	HPI: 
10426	3	a	79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI.
10427	0	a	It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday.
10428	0	a	She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV.
10429	0	a	She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress.
10430	0	a	ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection.
10431	0	a	Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.
10432	0	a	On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow.
10433	0	a	Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most.
10434	0	a	LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.
10435	0	a	A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.
10436	0	a	On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr.
10437	0	a	Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012.
10438	0	a	Her Temp.
10439	0	a	was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission.
10440	0	a	She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K.
10441	0	a	Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP.
10442	0	a	Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr.
10443	0	a	When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin.
10444	0	a	The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

11165	0	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
11166	0	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
11167	0	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
11168	0	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
11169	0	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
11170	0	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
11171	0	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
11172	0	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
11173	0	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

11224	0	a	HPI: 
11225	0	a	This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain.
11226	0	a	The first episode started this AM (10AM).
11227	0	a	It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic.
11228	0	a	Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v.
11229	0	a	Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.
11230	0	a	He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case.
11231	0	a	He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.
11232	0	a	Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain.
11233	0	a	On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain.
11234	0	a	He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker.
11235	0	a	His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3.
11236	0	a	First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

11354	0	a	  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency.
11355	0	a	The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant.
11356	0	a	In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out.
11357	0	a	Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it.
11358	0	a	Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.
11359	0	a	Major Problems
11360	0	a	Diabetes mellitus

11368	0	a	The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension.
11369	0	a	Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS.
11370	0	a	BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.
11371	0	a	Erectile dysfunction
11372	0	a	The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.
11373	0	a	For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.
11374	0	a	Anemia
11375	0	a	The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.
11376	0	a	He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.
11377	0	a	Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.

11738	0	a	33 y.o.
11739	0	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
11740	3	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
11741	0	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
11742	0	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
11743	0	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
11744	0	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
11745	0	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
11746	0	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
11747	0	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
11748	0	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
11749	0	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
11750	0	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
11751	0	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
11752	0	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
11753	0	a	No concentrated sweets diet
11754	0	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
11755	0	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
11756	0	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
11757	0	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
11758	0	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
11759	0	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

12168	0	a	This is relieved by sitting.
12169	0	a	It will happen when walking as well.
12170	0	a	This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
12171	0	a	He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.
12172	0	a	Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.

12191	0	a	Pulse of 60 and regular.
12192	0	a	Carotids 2+ without bruits.
12193	0	a	Mental status:  Unremarkable.

12197	0	a	Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
12198	0	a	Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
12199	0	a	Rapid alternating movements intact.
12200	0	a	Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
12201	0	a	Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
12202	0	a	The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.

12207	0	a	DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
12208	0	a	Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
12209	0	a	The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
12210	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  
12211	0	a	1.
12212	0	a	Neuropathy.
12213	0	a	The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
12214	0	a	He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
12215	0	a	He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.
12216	0	a	There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
12217	0	a	I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.
12218	0	a	I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
12219	0	a	He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
12220	0	a	I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
12221	0	a	Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.
12222	0	a	The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
12223	0	a	DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

12231	0	a	MRN:      7194334
12232	0	a	This patient is here for a follow-up.
12233	0	a	She was seen with a very complete evaluation 
12234	0	a	by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.
12235	0	a	She submitted a
12236	0	a	urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her
12237	0	a	urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.
12238	0	a	A fair amount retained
12239	0	a	as postvoid residual.
12240	0	a	Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with
12241	0	a	resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor
12242	0	a	and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
12243	0	a	She
12244	0	a	has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent
12245	0	a	infections.
12246	0	a	She is most concerned about having cancer.
12247	0	a	She is scheduled to see Dr.
12248	0	a	Quezada March 24th.
12249	0	a	The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
12250	0	a	been issues going around the housing projects.
12251	0	a	A 14-year-old girl was raped and
12252	0	a	one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
12253	0	a	She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
12254	0	a	She did not file a
12255	0	a	police report.
12256	0	a	As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
12257	0	a	reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix
12258	0	a	approximately one week ago.
12259	0	a	She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet
12260	0	a	sporadically but not on a regular basis.
12261	0	a	She denies any chest pressure or
12262	0	a	palpitations.
12263	0	a	She denies any shortness of breath.
12264	0	a	She denies any problems with
12265	0	a	pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.
12266	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.
12267	0	a	Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
12268	0	a	No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
12269	0	a	UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.
12270	0	a	Her
12271	0	a	ankle reveals trace edema on the left.
12272	0	a	Her right extremity is warm to palpation.
12273	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
12274	0	a	(1)  Hypertension.
12275	0	a	Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
12276	0	a	This
12277	0	a	     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.
12278	0	a	I have
12279	0	a	     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d.
12280	0	a	on a regular
12281	0	a	     basis.
12282	0	a	(2)  Anxiety.
12283	0	a	I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try
12284	0	a	     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.
12285	0	a	(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
12286	0	a	She had a urine culture submitted today.
12287	0	a	She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.
12288	0	a	     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
12289	0	a	I attempted to
12290	0	a	     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current
12291	0	a	     recurrent infections.
12292	0	a	It is more likely due to her cystocele.
12293	0	a	(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.
12294	0	a	This appears stable.
12295	0	a	She remains off the
12296	0	a	     cigarettes.
12297	0	a	(5)  ASCVD.
12298	0	a	She remains without symptoms.
12299	0	a	(6)  GERD.
12300	0	a	She remains on the Prilosec.
12301	3	a	(7)  Hyperlipidemia.
12302	0	a	She remains on Lipitor.
12303	0	a	She should have a repeat
12304	0	a	     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.
12305	0	a	(8)  Borderline high sugar.
12306	0	a	The patient should also have this rechecked with the
12307	0	a	     new physician in the fall.

12414	0	a	MRN:26649180
12415	0	a	Dear Dr. Short:
12416	0	a	Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr.
12417	0	a	Craft for the 
12418	0	a	possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
12419	0	a	As you know, he 
12420	0	a	is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
12421	0	a	history for a rheumatological disease.
12422	0	a	His past medical history, 
12423	0	a	briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
12424	0	a	time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
12425	0	a	he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
12426	0	a	characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
12427	0	a	stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.
12428	0	a	All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
12429	0	a	He was 
12430	0	a	treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
12431	0	a	that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
12432	0	a	symptoms and seizures went away.
12433	0	a	Since that time, he has had a 
12434	0	a	recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
12435	0	a	neck, pressure within his head.
12436	0	a	He considers himself to have 
12437	0	a	vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
12438	0	a	numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
12439	0	a	salivation and increased appetite.
12440	0	a	In describing his headache, he 
12441	0	a	noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
12442	0	a	has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
12443	0	a	quality.
12444	0	a	It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
12445	0	a	associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.
12446	0	a	There is no 
12447	0	a	family history of migraines as well.
12448	0	a	Also during his headache 
12449	0	a	events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
12450	0	a	nausea or vomiting.
12451	0	a	Past medical history:  As per above.
12452	0	a	Medicval issues include 
12453	0	a	bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
12454	0	a	gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
12455	0	a	migraine headaches.
12456	0	a	His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
12457	0	a	chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n.
12458	0	a	and 
12459	0	a	prednisone p.r.n.
12460	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.
12461	0	a	There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
12462	0	a	use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
12463	0	a	remission.

12466	0	a	Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
12467	0	a	mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.
12468	0	a	Social history:  He is a former stage manager.
12469	0	a	Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.
12470	0	a	Attention 
12471	0	a	was normal.
12472	0	a	Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
12473	0	a	errors.
12474	0	a	There is no memory deficit or agnosia.
12475	0	a	The patient gave 
12476	0	a	a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
12477	0	a	status testing was performed.
12478	0	a	Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
12479	0	a	fields were full.
12480	0	a	Disks were sharp.
12481	0	a	Fundus was clear.
12482	0	a	Extraocular movements were intact.
12483	0	a	There was no nystagmus.
12484	0	a	He 
12485	0	a	had normal facial sensation and symmetry.
12486	0	a	Hearing was grossly 
12487	0	a	normal.
12488	0	a	Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.
12489	0	a	Motor examination 
12490	0	a	revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.
12491	0	a	Deep tendon 
12492	0	a	reflexes were symmetrical.
12493	0	a	There was no upper motor neuron sign.
12494	0	a	Coordination and gait were normal.
12495	0	a	Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
12496	0	a	of lupus in the past.
12497	0	a	His recent blood work shows that his

12499	0	a	Taking into consideration his 
12500	0	a	current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
12501	0	a	evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular

12509	0	a	a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and

12567	0	a	Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec).
12568	0	a	1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired.
12569	0	a	Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day.
12570	0	a	Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made.
12571	0	a	STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed.
12572	0	a	Chest pain did not occur.
12573	0	a	REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.
12574	0	a	Sinus bradycardia 56/min.
12575	0	a	First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
12576	0	a	Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
12577	0	a	However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.
12578	0	a	SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size.
12579	0	a	There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
12580	0	a	The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study.
12581	0	a	Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
12582	0	a	CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.
12583	0	a	The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

13308	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
13309	0	a	She has been doing very well.
13310	0	a	She has been exercising and has lost from 
13311	0	a	200 to 170 pounds.
13312	0	a	She is feeling very well.
13313	0	a	Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.
13314	0	a	He did not find the 
13315	0	a	first ETT acceptable.
13316	0	a	The second ETT was grossly positive.
13317	0	a	As a result 
13318	0	a	of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
13319	0	a	atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
13320	0	a	nitrate.
13321	0	a	She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
13322	0	a	pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
13323	3	a	She did have hyperlipidemia.
13324	0	a	We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
13325	0	a	provided some control.
13326	1	a	However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
13327	0	a	is not an excellent ratio.
13328	0	a	Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
13329	0	a	limits.
13330	0	a	She also has right shoulder lipoma.
13331	0	a	This has become apparent since she 
13332	0	a	lost so much weight.
13333	0	a	She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
13334	0	a	recommended Dr. Dawson.
13335	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
13336	0	a	120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.
13337	0	a	Neck is supple.
13338	0	a	There 
13339	0	a	is no lymphadenopathy.
13340	0	a	Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
13341	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
13342	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
13343	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
13344	0	a	Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.
13345	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  None today.
13346	0	a	Page 2
13347	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
13348	0	a	1.
13349	0	a	CAD.
13350	0	a	We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.
13351	0	a	I also 
13352	0	a	gave her nitroglycerine.
13353	0	a	We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
13354	0	a	continue her atenolol.
13355	0	a	She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
13356	0	a	Premarin and Synthroid.
13357	0	a	2.
13358	0	a	Weight loss.
13359	0	a	She will continue to exercise.
13360	0	a	I suspect she is going 
13361	0	a	to lose more weight.
13362	0	a	This is excellent.
13363	0	a	3.
13364	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
13365	0	a	Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
13366	0	a	cardiac catheterization.
13367	0	a	It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
13368	0	a	this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
13369	0	a	She is going to 
13370	0	a	delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
13371	0	a	done on this variety of medical issues.

13512	0	a	Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week.
13513	0	a	The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain.
13514	0	a	He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder.
13515	0	a	No fevers/chills.
13516	0	a	Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

13523	0	a	Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.
13524	0	a	Medical Decision Making ED Course
13525	0	a	75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED.
13526	0	a	The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance.
13527	0	a	Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well.
13528	0	a	Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications).
13529	0	a	Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.
13530	0	a	Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

13742	0	a	ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
13743	0	a	Impression:  
13744	0	a	Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
13745	0	a	His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
13746	0	a	His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
13747	0	a	He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
13748	0	a	Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
13749	0	a	Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.
13750	0	a	Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
13751	0	a	He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
13752	0	a	His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
13753	0	a	He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
13754	0	a	Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
13755	0	a	His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

13785	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
13786	0	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
13787	0	a	The patient does relate that
13788	0	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
13789	0	a	worse several years ago.
13790	0	a	However, with the treatment of his
13791	0	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
13792	0	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
13793	0	a	Since that
13794	0	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
13795	0	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
13796	0	a	At the same
13797	0	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
13798	0	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
13799	0	a	Lasix.
13800	0	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
13801	0	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
13802	0	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
13803	0	a	At the current time,
13804	0	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
13805	0	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
13806	0	a	months ago.
13807	0	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
13808	0	a	supplemental oxygen.
13809	0	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
13810	0	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
13811	0	a	coughing.
13812	0	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
13813	0	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
13814	0	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
13815	3	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
13816	0	a	upper GI bleed.

13818	0	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
13819	0	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
13820	0	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
13821	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
13822	0	a	He discontinued cigarette
13823	0	a	smoking years ago.
13824	0	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
13825	0	a	His pulse was
13826	0	a	56, afebrile.
13827	0	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
13828	0	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
13829	0	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
13830	0	a	He is in no
13831	0	a	respiratory distress at rest.
13832	0	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
13833	0	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
13834	0	a	His neck had no
13835	0	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
13836	0	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
13837	0	a	left base with crackles.
13838	0	a	His right lung was clear.
13839	0	a	His heart
13840	0	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
13841	0	a	murmur.
13842	0	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
13843	0	a	His
13844	0	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
13845	0	a	Pulmonary
13846	0	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
13847	0	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
13848	0	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
13849	0	a	His current
13850	0	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
13851	0	a	December.
13852	0	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
13853	0	a	I took Mr. Joshi
13854	0	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
13855	0	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
13856	0	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
13857	0	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
13858	0	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
13859	0	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
13860	0	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
13861	0	a	Mr. Joshi had several
13862	0	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
13863	0	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
13864	0	a	I do
13865	0	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
13866	0	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
13867	0	a	I do recommend that he get
13868	0	a	daily exercise.
13869	0	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
13870	0	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
13871	0	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
13872	0	a	I have also
13873	0	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
13874	0	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
13875	0	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
13876	0	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
13877	0	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

13880	0	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
13881	0	a	his initial work-up.
13882	0	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
13883	0	a	patient.
13884	0	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

13901	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
13902	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
13903	0	a	As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.
13904	0	a	At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.
13905	0	a	No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.
13906	0	a	Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
13907	0	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
13908	0	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
13909	0	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.
13910	0	a	He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.
13911	0	a	At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.
13912	0	a	Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.
13913	0	a	He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.
13914	0	a	He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
13915	0	a	He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.
13916	0	a	He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.
13917	0	a	"He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well."
13918	0	a	He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.
13919	0	a	He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.
13920	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
13921	0	a	His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.
13922	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.
13923	0	a	His past medical history includes:
13924	0	a	  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
13925	0	a	  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
13926	0	a	  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
13927	0	a	  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
13928	3	a	  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
13929	0	a	  hypothyroid
13930	0	a	  basal cell skin CA
13931	0	a	  nephrolithiasis
13932	0	a	His medications include:
13933	0	a	  Lipitor 80 mg
13934	0	a	  Plavix 150 mg
13935	0	a	  ASA 325 mg po QD
13936	0	a	  Toprol 200 mg po BID
13937	0	a	  Levoxyl
13938	0	a	  Omega-3-fatty acids
13939	0	a	  Multivitamin
13940	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
13941	3	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
13942	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.
13943	0	a	He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.
13944	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
13945	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
13946	0	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
13947	0	a	He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.
13948	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.
13949	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
13950	0	a	His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.
13951	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
13952	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
13953	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
13954	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
13955	0	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
13956	0	a	In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.
13957	0	a	He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.
13958	0	a	Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.
13959	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
13960	0	a	His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.
13961	0	a	I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.
13962	0	a	As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.
13963	0	a	We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.
13964	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
13965	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
13966	0	a	Regards,

14260	0	a	CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.
14261	0	a	IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP.
14262	0	a	His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
14263	0	a	His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke.
14264	0	a	The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification.
14265	0	a	Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis.
14266	0	a	Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely.
14267	0	a	Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported.
14268	0	a	The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP.
14269	0	a	The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.

14491	0	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
14492	0	a	was positive.
14493	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
14494	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
14495	0	a	She had 1mm 
14496	0	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
14497	0	a	disease.
14498	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
14499	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
14500	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
14501	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
14502	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
14503	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
14504	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
14505	0	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
14506	0	a	She 
14507	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
14508	0	a	for taking it.
14509	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
14510	0	a	on atenolol.
14511	0	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
14512	0	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
14513	0	a	I will continue to work 
14514	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
14515	0	a	Her other risk 
14516	3	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
14517	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
14518	0	a	Her 
14519	0	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
14520	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
14521	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
14522	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
14523	0	a	hospital.

15283	0	a	Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C
15284	0	a	antibody with normal LFT's.
15285	0	a	Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA
15286	0	a	level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the
15287	0	a	lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody
15288	0	a	positive.
15289	0	a	If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than
15290	0	a	she requires no further workup.
15291	0	a	However, if she is RNA positive
15292	0	a	than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of
15293	0	a	inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for
15294	0	a	treatment with interferon/ribavirin.
15295	0	a	She is amenable to this and
15296	0	a	we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of

15457	3	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
15458	0	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
15459	0	a	Although, there were no 
15460	0	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
15461	0	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
15462	0	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
15463	0	a	However, Pt 
15464	0	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
15465	0	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
15466	0	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
15467	0	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
15468	0	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
15469	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
15470	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
15471	0	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
15472	0	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
15473	0	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
15474	0	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
15475	0	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
15476	0	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
15477	0	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
15478	0	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
15479	0	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
15480	0	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.

15490	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
15491	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
15492	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
15493	0	a	Briefly:
15494	3	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
15495	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
15496	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
15497	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
15498	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
15499	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
15500	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
15501	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
15502	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

15757	0	a	HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.
15758	3	a	He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking.
15759	0	a	He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
15760	0	a	He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
15761	0	a	He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
15762	0	a	He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.
15763	0	a	He has not had any rest pain.
15764	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
15765	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
15766	0	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
15767	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
15768	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
15769	0	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
15770	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
15771	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
15772	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
15773	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
15774	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
15775	0	a	Chest was clear.
15776	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
15777	0	a	No S3 or S4.
15778	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
15779	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
15780	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
15781	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
15782	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
15783	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
15784	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
15785	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
15786	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

15800	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
15801	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.
15802	0	a	She continues to
15803	0	a	complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
15804	0	a	secondary to exertion.
15805	0	a	These episodes occur on a roughly once a
15806	0	a	month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes.
15807	0	a	Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
15808	0	a	effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
15809	0	a	not take Nitroglycerin for it.
15810	0	a	A stress test performed last
15811	0	a	January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
15812	0	a	of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
15813	0	a	blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.
15814	0	a	She had no ischemic
15815	0	a	EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
15816	0	a	scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
15817	0	a	surrounding area of transient ischemia.
15818	0	a	In addition, there was a
15819	0	a	moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
15820	0	a	infarct mild ischemia.
15821	2	a	Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
15822	1	a	with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192.
15823	0	a	She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.

15854	0	a	and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
15855	0	a	nonspecific ST and T wave changes.
15856	0	a	Compared to his last
15857	0	a	electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
15858	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
15859	0	a	angina.
15860	0	a	I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
15861	0	a	q h.s.
15862	3	a	for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
15863	0	a	more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
15864	0	a	aerobic activity level.
15865	0	a	In addition, I have asked her to obtain
15866	0	a	her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
15867	0	a	ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
15868	0	a	140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
15869	0	a	antihypertensive therapy.
15870	0	a	In addition, as long as she remains
15871	0	a	active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
15872	0	a	stress test in one to one and a half years time.
15873	0	a	Beyond this I
15874	0	a	have not altered her present regimen.
15875	0	a	Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.

15888	0	a	ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections
15889	0	a	HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.
15890	0	a	Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.
15891	0	a	The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.
15892	0	a	Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.
15893	0	a	Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.
15894	0	a	He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.
15895	0	a	Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.
15896	0	a	His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.
15897	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
15898	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
15899	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
15900	0	a	The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.
15901	0	a	The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.
15902	0	a	He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
15903	0	a	His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.
15904	0	a	Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.
15905	0	a	The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.
15906	0	a	This may represent abscess.
15907	0	a	Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.
15908	0	a	Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.
15909	0	a	Patient denies fever or chills.
15910	0	a	He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.
15911	0	a	This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.
15912	0	a	Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.
15913	0	a	He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.
15914	0	a	His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.
15915	0	a	He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.
15916	0	a	His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.
15917	0	a	While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.
15918	0	a	He cries when he tells me about this.
15919	0	a	A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.
15920	0	a	He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.
15921	0	a	His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.
15922	0	a	There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.
15923	0	a	He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.
15924	0	a	An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.
15925	0	a	He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.
15926	0	a	Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.
15927	0	a	They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses.

16298	0	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
16299	0	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
16300	0	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
16301	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
16302	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
16303	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
16304	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
16305	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
16306	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
16307	0	a	Cultures were negative.
16308	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
16309	0	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
16310	0	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
16311	0	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
16312	0	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
16313	0	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
16314	0	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
16315	0	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
16316	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
16317	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
16318	0	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
16319	0	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
16320	0	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
16321	0	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
16322	0	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
16323	3	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
16324	0	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
16325	0	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
16326	0	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
16327	0	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.

16337	0	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
16338	0	a	Pulse 126, regular.
16339	0	a	BP 126/66.
16340	0	a	She is obese.
16341	0	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
16342	0	a	There are no cranial bruits.
16343	0	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.

16345	0	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
16346	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
16347	0	a	The extremities are normal.
16348	0	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
16349	0	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
16350	0	a	She is oriented to place.
16351	0	a	She is inattentive.
16352	0	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
16353	0	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
16354	0	a	There is no aphasia.
16355	0	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
16356	0	a	The visual fields are full.
16357	0	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
16358	0	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
16359	0	a	.
16360	0	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
16361	0	a	Facial sensation is intact.
16362	0	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
16363	0	a	Hearing is grossly intact.

16371	0	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
16372	0	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
16373	0	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
16374	0	a	Coordination is intact.
16375	0	a	Romberg is negative.
16376	0	a	Gait and station are normal.
16377	0	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
16378	0	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
16379	0	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
16380	0	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
16381	0	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
16382	0	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
16383	0	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
16384	0	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
16385	0	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
16386	0	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
16387	0	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
16388	0	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
16389	0	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
16390	0	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
16391	0	a	Thank you for this consultation.
16392	0	a	Sincerely,

16962	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and
16963	0	a	intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
16964	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after
16965	0	a	her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
16966	0	a	October.
16967	0	a	Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
16968	0	a	persistent pleural effusion.
16969	0	a	We will reevaluate today with a
16970	0	a	repeat chest x-ray.
16971	0	a	In the meantime, I think that we should
16972	0	a	continue her oral diuretic regimen.
16973	0	a	It is possible that her
16974	0	a	persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
16975	0	a	Although not certain to
16976	0	a	be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today
16977	0	a	in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
16978	0	a	resolve.
16979	0	a	I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
16980	0	a	We
16981	0	a	will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for
16982	0	a	secondary prevention.
16983	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in
16984	0	a	approximately eight to twelve weeks.
16985	0	a	In addition, she will follow-
16986	0	a	up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
16987	0	a	persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
16988	0	a	symptoms.
16989	0	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078
16990	0	a	It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.
16991	0	a	Please do
16992	0	a	not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

17524	0	a	After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.
17525	0	a	He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent.
17526	0	a	He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen.
17527	0	a	He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent.
17528	0	a	He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.
17529	0	a	The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.
17530	0	a	He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.

18088	0	a	To Dr. Estep:
18089	0	a	I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.
18090	0	a	Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
18091	0	a	Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.
18092	0	a	We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
18093	0	a	In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
18094	0	a	She recalls having only V2 clinical events.
18095	0	a	She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.
18096	0	a	She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
18097	0	a	This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
18098	0	a	There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.
18099	0	a	She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.
18100	0	a	She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.
18101	0	a	She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.
18102	0	a	She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
18103	0	a	Moreover, she does not have claudication.
18104	0	a	Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.
18105	0	a	She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

18146	0	a	Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.
18147	0	a	Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.
18148	0	a	She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.
18149	0	a	Social History:  This woman is single.
18150	0	a	She is a retired Secretary.
18151	0	a	She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.
18152	0	a	She has no other history of substance abuse.
18153	0	a	Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.
18154	0	a	She has no other new symptoms.
18155	0	a	There is no recent GI bleeding.
18156	0	a	She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.
18157	0	a	On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.
18158	0	a	Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.
18159	0	a	Head and neck exam is unremarkable.
18160	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
18161	0	a	She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
18162	0	a	Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
18163	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
18164	0	a	Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
18165	0	a	Her apex beat is within normal limits.
18166	0	a	Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
18167	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
18168	0	a	There are no obvious masses.
18169	0	a	Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
18170	0	a	Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.
18171	0	a	They are symmetrical.
18172	0	a	Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.
18173	0	a	A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
18174	0	a	Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
18175	0	a	We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
18176	0	a	(It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).
18177	0	a	Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.
18178	0	a	If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.
18179	0	a	Her hypertension is controlled today.
18180	0	a	Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
18181	0	a	However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o.
18182	0	a	We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.
18183	0	a	It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
18184	0	a	She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
18185	0	a	We recommend.
18186	0	a	We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
18187	0	a	We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
18188	0	a	daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
18189	0	a	We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
18190	0	a	We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.
18191	0	a	We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

18550	0	a	Normal RV function with RVSP 44.
18551	0	a	Impression:
18552	0	a	Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history.
18553	0	a	Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure.
18554	0	a	Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital.
18555	0	a	Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history.
18556	0	a	This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.
18557	0	a	Recommendations:
18558	0	a	-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100
18559	0	a	-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively
18560	0	a	-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID
18561	0	a	-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery.
18562	0	a	Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive
18563	0	a	Thank you for this interesting consult.
18564	0	a	To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

18817	0	a	       MR #631-90-33-7
18818	0	a	Dear Dr. Patton:
18819	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
18820	0	a	his coronary artery
18821	0	a	disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.
18822	0	a	As you know, this is a 
18823	0	a	63-year-old male with a
18824	0	a	long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 
18825	0	a	peripheral vascular
18826	3	a	disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 
18827	0	a	diagnosed
18828	0	a	esophageal carcinoma.
18829	0	a	He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 
18830	0	a	Landers, for the last nine
18831	0	a	years.
18832	0	a	Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
18833	0	a	artery disease which is
18834	0	a	documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
18835	0	a	The 
18836	0	a	catheterization demonstrated
18837	0	a	right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 
18838	0	a	and a 30%
18839	0	a	marginal 1 lesion.
18840	0	a	There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
18841	0	a	PDA and from the
18842	0	a	septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.
18843	0	a	procedure was
18844	0	a	performed through the right radial artery without complications.
18845	0	a	Patient 
18846	0	a	also has peripheral
18847	0	a	vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
18848	0	a	vein bypass graft in
18849	0	a	2088.
18850	0	a	He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
18851	0	a	femoral to posterior
18852	0	a	tibial graft.
18853	0	a	He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.
18854	0	a	His activity level is 
18855	0	a	limited by his claudication.
18856	3	a	He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 
18857	0	a	treatment.
18858	0	a	At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.
18859	0	a	He gets 
18860	0	a	chest pressure one to
18861	0	a	two times a month.
18862	0	a	However, his activity is extremely limited.
18863	0	a	He reports 
18864	0	a	that he has had a
18865	0	a	positive stress test.
18866	0	a	Further information is not available.
18867	0	a	understands he has coronary
18868	0	a	disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.
18869	0	a	On 
18870	0	a	catheterization he had
18871	0	a	preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
18872	0	a	He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
18873	0	a	after receiving
18874	0	a	chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
18875	0	a	Patient states he will be

18881	0	a	therapy.
18882	0	a	On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.
18883	0	a	His blood 
18884	0	a	pressure is 100/72,
18885	0	a	heart rate is 57 bpm.
18886	0	a	HEENT: oropharynx benign.
18887	0	a	Neck: carotids intact 
18888	0	a	bilaterally without
18889	0	a	audible bruits.
18890	0	a	Lungs: distant breath sounds.
18891	0	a	Cor: without obvious jugular 
18892	0	a	venous distention.
18893	0	a	Heart sounds distant.
18894	0	a	Normal S1 and S2.
18895	0	a	No appreciable murmurs.
18896	0	a	Abdomen: 
18897	0	a	unable to palpate
18898	0	a	firm masses or aortic aneurysm.
18899	0	a	Bowel sounds present.
18900	0	a	Extremities: status 
18901	0	a	post surgery to the

18903	0	a	Distal pulses are absent.
18904	0	a	Neuro: 
18905	0	a	intact.
18906	0	a	EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.
18907	0	a	IMI with age undetermined.
18908	0	a	Nonspecific STT
18909	0	a	wave abnormalities present.
18910	0	a	No previous EKG for comparison.
18911	0	a	Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 
18912	0	a	artery disease and
18913	0	a	peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
18914	0	a	He 
18915	0	a	clearly has ischemia
18916	0	a	on a positive stress test.
18917	0	a	I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
18918	0	a	check ischemic
18919	0	a	threshold.
18920	0	a	He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
18921	0	a	event.
18922	0	a	However, given
18923	0	a	his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 
18924	0	a	surgery even
18925	0	a	understanding possible complications.
18926	0	a	Plan:
18927	0	a	1.
18928	0	a	Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
18929	0	a	2.
18930	0	a	Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
18931	0	a	control of
18932	0	a	     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 
18933	0	a	dobutamine
18934	0	a	     echocardiography.
18935	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael

20718	0	a	Interval History:
20719	0	a	   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today.
20720	0	a	His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test.
20721	0	a	He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.
20722	0	a	His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia.
20723	0	a	He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.
20724	0	a	Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.
20725	0	a	Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.
20726	0	a	"He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol."
20727	0	a	The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week.
20728	0	a	He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different.
20729	0	a	He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.
20730	0	a	He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.

20760	0	a	   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath.
20761	0	a	I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise.
20762	0	a	We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.
20763	0	a	We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.
20764	0	a	The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

21209	0	a	myocardial infarction.
21210	0	a	There has been no diagnostic change since
21211	0	a	July 18, 2086.
21212	0	a	Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,
21213	0	a	2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
21214	0	a	and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
21215	0	a	The
21216	0	a	velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
21217	0	a	calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
21218	0	a	2086.
21219	0	a	Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left
21220	0	a	femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
21221	0	a	velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
21222	0	a	thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.
21223	0	a	The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent

21275	0	a	Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
21276	0	a	blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.
21277	0	a	I have been 
21278	0	a	readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
21279	0	a	several months ago.
21280	0	a	His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
21281	0	a	q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d.
21282	0	a	and atenolol 25mg q.d.
21283	0	a	He apparently went 
21284	0	a	to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
21285	0	a	to have high blood pressure.
21286	0	a	She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
21287	0	a	from 25mg to 50mg.
21288	0	a	He has not yet completed that prescription.
21289	0	a	Mr. 
21290	0	a	Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.
21291	0	a	He denies any recent chest 
21292	0	a	pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.
21293	0	a	Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
21294	0	a	elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.
21295	0	a	His 
21296	1	a	current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  
21297	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
21298	0	a	headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
21299	0	a	diarrhea, dysuria.
21300	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.
21301	0	a	His weight is 184.
21302	0	a	His heart rate is 80.
21303	0	a	Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
21304	0	a	The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
21305	0	a	murmurs.
21306	0	a	Abdominal exam is benign.
21307	0	a	Extremities show no evidence of 
21308	0	a	edema.
21309	0	a	Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
21310	0	a	chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.
21311	0	a	He has a 
21312	0	a	normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.
21313	0	a	His T4 is 
21314	0	a	normal at 10.3.
21315	0	a	His THBR is normal at 0.98.
21316	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
21317	0	a	1.
21318	0	a	Hypertension.
21319	0	a	Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
21320	0	a	     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.
21321	0	a	He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.
21322	0	a	I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
21323	0	a	     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
21324	0	a	     few weeks for blood pressure check.
21325	0	a	2.
21326	3	a	Cholesterol.
21327	0	a	The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.
21328	0	a	Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
21329	0	a	     130.
21330	0	a	Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.
21331	0	a	His current 
21332	0	a	     liver function tests are normal.

21336	0	a	Health maintenance.
21337	0	a	I have recommended to him losing some weight.
21338	0	a	He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.
21339	0	a	He attributes 
21340	0	a	     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of 
21341	0	a	     exercise.
21342	0	a	I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.
21343	0	a	He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last

21431	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a complicated 72-year-old woman who has a history significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in January of 2080 at Madison Medical Center for aortic stenosis.
21432	0	a	She also has a history of interstitial lung disease, maintained on prednisone slow taper.
21433	3	a	She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
21434	0	a	She had been residing at a nursing home and complained of chest pain, jaw pain and bilateral shoulder pain for approximately 1 week.
21435	0	a	Eventually, the patient was transferred to Wheeling Clinic.
21436	0	a	Here in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, which improved to the 90s with volume and blood resuscitation.
21437	0	a	She also found to be tachycardic and have a hematocrit of 25%.
21438	0	a	The patient was also found to be guaiac positive on stool occult blood.
21439	0	a	Her troponin was mildly elevated.
21440	0	a	The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and her chest discomfort has improved.
21441	0	a	She also underwent echocardiography on 03/26/80, which was a fair quality study with a mildly dilated left ventricle, mild LVH, septal flattening consistent with RV pressure overload and an estimated ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
21442	0	a	Diastolic dysfunction was also noted.
21443	0	a	There was dilatation of both atria and the right ventricle with mildly reduced RV systolic function.
21444	0	a	The aortic valve could not be well visualized.
21445	0	a	There was reduced cusp excursion with severe aortic stenosis.
21446	0	a	There was mild tricuspid regurgitation and estimated PASP of 60 to 65 mmHg plus RA pressure.

21454	0	a	She also notes peripheral edema that seems worse now than it did back in September.
21455	0	a	She denies any fevers, chills or cough.
21456	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in 2078, BOOP, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and congestive heart failure.
21457	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Her discharge medications from Wheeling Clinic were prednisone 25 mg p.o.
21458	0	a	once daily, Humalog insulin sliding scale, metoprolol 6.25 mg p.o.

21470	0	a	ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.
21471	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home.
21472	0	a	She typically ambulates with a walker, though she has become dyspneic even ambulating a few feet.
21473	0	a	She quit smoking 40 years ago.
21474	0	a	There is no alcohol use.
21475	0	a	She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer.
21476	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.
21477	0	a	Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6.
21478	0	a	JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.
21479	0	a	Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right.
21480	0	a	Air movement is fair.
21481	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
21482	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.
21483	0	a	On heart exam, PMI could not be felt.
21484	0	a	There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.
21485	0	a	There are no rubs or gallops.
21486	0	a	Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
21487	0	a	There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.
21488	0	a	EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG.
21489	0	a	Lab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose.
21490	0	a	Magnesium and calcium were normal.
21491	0	a	Albumin is low at 2.6.
21492	0	a	Liver function tests are normal.
21493	0	a	Creatinine kinase is 15, troponin is 0.7 and B-natriuretic peptide is 2510.
21494	0	a	Thyroid studies are pending.
21495	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7.
21496	0	a	CBC shows mild anemia with hematocrit of 35.8% with normal hemoglobin of 12.2, elevated white count at 13.32 and platelet count of 305,000.
21497	0	a	Coagulation studies are normal.
21498	0	a	IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved.
21499	0	a	The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.
21500	0	a	I think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.
21501	0	a	On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology.
21502	0	a	Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation.
21503	0	a	If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery.
21504	0	a	In addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray.
21505	0	a	Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it.
21506	0	a	Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure.
21507	0	a	Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.

21824	0	a	Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.
21825	0	a	I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.

21835	0	a	She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.
21836	0	a	4.
21837	0	a	Fatigue.
21838	0	a	This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40.
21839	0	a	This is what the patient and her daughter believe.
21840	0	a	She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this.

21842	0	a	Check cbc.
21843	0	a	5.

21861	0	a	Lichen simplex chronicus.

21865	0	a	13.
21866	0	a	Osteopenia.
21867	0	a	She will continue calcium and vitamin D.  I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.

22150	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
22151	0	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
22152	0	a	depression.
22153	0	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
22154	0	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
22155	0	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
22156	0	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
22157	0	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
22158	0	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
22159	0	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
22160	0	a	study.
22161	0	a	She is scheduled later this month.
22162	0	a	She has no new complaints, 
22163	0	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
22164	0	a	it over the past two days.
22165	0	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
22166	0	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
22167	0	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
22168	0	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
22169	0	a	the morning.
22170	0	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
22171	0	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
22172	0	a	that she has been taking them.
22173	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
22174	0	a	this is true or not.
22175	0	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
22176	0	a	She says 
22177	0	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
22178	0	a	She was recently started on 
22179	0	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
22180	0	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
22181	0	a	a month.
22182	0	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
22183	0	a	She says overall 
22184	0	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
22185	0	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
22186	0	a	We again discussed the 
22187	0	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
22188	0	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
22189	0	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
22190	0	a	frequency.
22191	0	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
22192	0	a	rest.

22194	0	a	Page 2
22195	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
22196	0	a	Her 
22197	0	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
22198	0	a	Her weight today is 
22199	0	a	249lb.
22200	0	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.
22201	0	a	Her JVP is not visible at 90 
22202	0	a	degrees.
22203	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
22204	0	a	Her lungs are clear to 
22205	0	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
22206	0	a	positive S1, S2.
22207	0	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
22208	0	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
22209	0	a	Her finger stick 
22210	0	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
22211	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
22212	0	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
22213	0	a	Diabetes.
22214	0	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
22215	0	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
22216	0	a	Finger stick in the 
22217	0	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
22218	0	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
22219	0	a	     over the past couple of months.
22220	0	a	In any event, she most likely need 
22221	0	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
22222	0	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
22223	0	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
22224	0	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
22225	0	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
22226	3	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
22227	0	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
22228	0	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
22229	0	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
22230	0	a	Coronary disease.
22231	0	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
22232	0	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
22233	0	a	as she did have room to go 
22234	0	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
22235	0	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
22236	0	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
22237	0	a	Again, reinforced the 
22238	0	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
22239	0	a	     again as I have in the past.
22240	0	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
22241	0	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
22242	0	a	I told her she should take the 
22243	0	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
22244	0	a	Health maintenance.
22245	0	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
22246	0	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
22247	0	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
22248	0	a	Additionally, I 
22249	0	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
22250	0	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
22251	0	a	I also stressed the

22253	0	a	Page 3
22254	0	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
22255	0	a	She says she is scheduled 
22256	0	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
22257	0	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

22527	0	a	 Attending Note
22528	0	a	I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.
22529	0	a	I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.
22530	3	a	The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.
22531	0	a	Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.
22532	0	a	CTA was also normal.
22533	0	a	He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past.
22534	0	a	Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.
22535	0	a	His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.
22536	0	a	It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;
22537	0	a	The exam today showed:
22538	0	a	Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
22539	0	a	Left APD
22540	0	a	Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
22541	0	a	Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.
22542	0	a	Was not in UMN fashion.
22543	0	a	Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.
22544	0	a	Assessment:  
22545	0	a	Status post TIA possibly related to AF
22546	0	a	Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
22547	0	a	The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
22548	0	a	Plan:
22549	0	a	Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
22550	0	a	Continue 
22551	0	a	ASA and coumadin and statin

22567	0	a	  RE:  Adler, Imogene
22568	0	a	  MRN: 618-13-82-6
22569	0	a	  Dear Dr. Yingling:
22570	0	a	  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,
22571	0	a	  for her problem of coronary ischemia.
22572	0	a	As you know, Ms.
22573	0	a	  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of
22574	3	a	  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is
22575	0	a	  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest
22576	0	a	  tightness associated with exertion.
22577	0	a	A stress MIBI SPECT
22578	0	a	  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and
22579	0	a	  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex
22580	0	a	  distribution.
22581	0	a	The details of the study include an exercise
22582	0	a	  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and
22583	0	a	  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from
22584	0	a	  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and
22585	0	a	  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a
22586	0	a	  rate pressure product of 33,390).
22587	0	a	The test was stopped due
22588	0	a	  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.
22589	0	a	EKG
22590	0	a	  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and
22591	0	a	  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.
22592	0	a	Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her
22593	0	a	  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and
22594	0	a	  verapamil 240mg q.d.
22595	0	a	A recent lipid panel demonstrated a
22596	1	a	  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.
22597	0	a	On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing
22598	0	a	  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute
22599	0	a	  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.
22600	0	a	Jugular
22601	0	a	  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.
22602	0	a	Carotids
22603	0	a	  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.
22604	0	a	Chest
22605	0	a	  examination was clear to auscultation.
22606	0	a	Heart examination
22607	0	a	  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split
22608	0	a	  S2, no murmurs or rubs.
22609	0	a	Abdominal examination was 
22610	0	a	  Page 2
22611	0	a	  unremarkable.
22612	0	a	Peripheral examination demonstrated no
22613	0	a	  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
22614	0	a	EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
22615	0	a	  EKG.
22616	0	a	I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
22617	0	a	  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
22618	0	a	  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
22619	0	a	  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
22620	0	a	We reviewed the
22621	0	a	  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
22622	0	a	  angiography and possible angioplasty.
22623	0	a	I made no solid
22624	0	a	  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty
22625	0	a	  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
22626	0	a	  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
22627	0	a	  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and
22628	0	a	  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
22629	0	a	  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
22630	0	a	  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
22631	0	a	  tolerance.
22632	0	a	She and her husband are going to reflect on
22633	0	a	  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the

23049	0	a	Impression:
23050	0	a	Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
23051	0	a	Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality

23055	0	a	Recs:
23056	0	a	Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
23057	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
23058	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
23059	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.

23308	0	a	The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia.
23309	0	a	Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out.
23310	0	a	The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable.
23311	0	a	Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms.
23312	0	a	ECG warrants following.
23313	0	a	Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.

24185	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.
24186	0	a	ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.
24187	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.
24188	0	a	In general, he is in no acute distress.

24196	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
24197	0	a	The extremities show no edema.
24198	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
24199	0	a	1.
24200	0	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
24201	0	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
24202	0	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
24203	0	a	2.
24204	0	a	BPH.
24205	0	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
24206	0	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
24207	0	a	3.
24208	0	a	Hypertension.
24209	0	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
24210	0	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
24211	0	a	4.
24212	0	a	COPD.
24213	0	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
24214	0	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
24215	0	a	5.
24216	0	a	Elevated cholesterol.
24217	0	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
24218	0	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
24219	0	a	6.
24220	0	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
24221	0	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
24222	0	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
24223	0	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

24244	0	a	She does not note that this is 
24245	0	a	associated with exertion.
24246	0	a	She does have diaphoresis associated with it.
24247	0	a	She does not have any shortness of breath.

24256	0	a	She has just had a hysterectomy.
24257	0	a	needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.
24258	0	a	However, today I am most 
24259	0	a	concerned about her chest heaviness.
24260	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
24261	0	a	20 and pulse is 68.
24262	0	a	Neck is supple.

24276	0	a	We 
24277	0	a	sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
24278	0	a	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
24279	0	a	We also sent her for an exercise 
24280	0	a	tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
24281	0	a	maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
24282	0	a	seconds.
24283	0	a	She had no evidence of ischemia.
24284	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
24285	0	a	1.
24286	0	a	Chest heaviness.
24287	0	a	I am not sure what is causing this.
24288	0	a	She may have a 
24289	0	a	primary pulmonary problem.
24290	0	a	She will be following up with us in one 
24291	0	a	week.

24414	0	a	Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.
24415	0	a	ASSESSMENT & PLAN
24416	0	a	87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.
24417	0	a	The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
24418	0	a	Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.
24419	0	a	Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
24420	0	a	However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.
24421	0	a	Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
24422	0	a	As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
24423	0	a	LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
24424	0	a	One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.
24425	0	a	A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
24426	0	a	Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly.
24427	0	a	However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
24428	0	a	Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative.
24429	0	a	CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
24430	0	a	Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
24431	0	a	will d/w attending
24432	0	a	consider psychiatric consult
24433	0	a	Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
24434	0	a	Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH
24435	0	a	H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.
24436	0	a	NIDDM: Will start RISS
24437	3	a	Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD
24438	0	a	HTN: metoprolol
24439	0	a	Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

25872	0	a	Dear Dr.  Morgan:
25873	0	a	  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.
25874	0	a	She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago.
25875	3	a	She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD.
25876	0	a	She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine.
25877	0	a	She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler.
25878	0	a	With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.
25879	0	a	She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time.
25880	0	a	These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week.
25881	0	a	She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.
25882	0	a	To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
25883	0	a	This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery.
25884	0	a	There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery.
25885	0	a	She was then referred to me for further evaluation.
25886	0	a	Past medical history:
25887	0	a	   Hypertension.

25927	0	a	-Pulse:   70
25928	0	a	-BP: 142/70  
25929	0	a	-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest
25930	0	a	-Skin:   Free of rashes
25931	0	a	-Heent:   benign
25932	0	a	-Neck:   JVP was at 5.

25940	0	a	"			EKG:"
25941	0	a	    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.
25942	0	a	Assessment and plan:
25943	3	a	   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past.
25944	0	a	She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy.
25945	0	a	Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm.
25946	0	a	I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan.
25947	0	a	She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.
25948	0	a	Plan: 
25949	0	a	1.
25950	0	a	Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.
25951	0	a	2.
25952	0	a	Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.
25953	0	a	3.
25954	0	a	I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
25955	0	a	4.
25956	0	a	I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

26111	0	a	She then follows with a long discussion of the difficulties in securing 
26112	0	a	diabetic supplies.
26113	0	a	Her home blood glucoses have been variable, reportedly 
26114	0	a	due to poorly functioning glucose meter.
26115	0	a	The Neurology Consultant has added lisinopril and Plavix to her regimen.
26116	0	a	Had what appears to have been an injection of epidural steroids for treatment 
26117	0	a	of symptoms referable to spinal stenosis per Dr. Jaeger, to good effect.
26118	0	a	Her 
26119	0	a	back pain has now begun to recrudesce, and she is considering another such 
26120	0	a	injection.

26200	0	a	Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 
26201	0	a	Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 
26202	0	a	s/p XRT to esophagus
26203	0	a	Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 
26204	0	a	History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
26205	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
26206	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
26207	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
26208	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
26209	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
26210	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
26211	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
26212	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
26213	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
26214	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
26215	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
26216	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
26217	0	a	He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.
26218	0	a	He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
26219	0	a	He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.
26220	0	a	No bleeding.
26221	0	a	He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest.
26222	0	a	He is fatigued.
26223	0	a	Dizziness is improved with decrease in hypertension meds

26591	0	a	Nixon.
26592	0	a	He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
26593	0	a	thinks that this should get better.
26594	0	a	We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
26595	0	a	range.
26596	0	a	We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
26597	0	a	that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
26598	0	a	dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
26599	0	a	He has remained on digoxin status 
26600	0	a	post his myocardial infarction.
26601	0	a	We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
26602	0	a	We also have been concerned 
26603	0	a	that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
26604	0	a	about his wife's situation with breast cancer.
26605	0	a	We had a long discussion 
26606	0	a	about this.
26607	0	a	Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.
26608	0	a	His blood pressure was 178/80.
26609	0	a	The follow-up was 170/80.
26610	0	a	His neck was

26613	0	a	Cardiac 
26614	0	a	exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
26615	0	a	Abdomen

26629	0	a	Status post TURP.
26630	0	a	He appears to be recovering well.
26631	0	a	He has had 
26632	0	a	     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
26633	0	a	2.
26634	0	a	Thrombocytopenia.
26635	0	a	This was very relative.
26636	0	a	It now appears to have

26639	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
26640	0	a	As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
26641	0	a	     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.
26642	0	a	At 
26643	0	a	     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
26644	0	a	     Lasix.
26645	0	a	However, it may be that he would benefit from further

26654	0	a	He continues on Ambien.
26655	0	a	He has some discretion about

27193	0	a	Imp/Plan:
27194	0	a	Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature.
27195	0	a	The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.
27196	0	a	He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow.

27198	0	a	He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM.
27199	0	a	We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out.
27200	0	a	Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.
27201	0	a	In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically.
27202	0	a	Is any of this TB?
27203	0	a	Recommend:
27204	0	a	-- skeletal survey
27205	0	a	-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas
27206	0	a	-- beta-2 microglobulin
27207	0	a	-- reticulocyte count
27208	0	a	-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco
27209	0	a	-- guaiac all stools
27210	0	a	-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential
27211	0	a	-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today.

27356	0	a	HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar strokes who presents with L arm numbness.
27357	0	a	Patient was sitting on her couch this morning between 9-10 AM when she began to have L arm numbness.
27358	0	a	She initially thought it was from leaning on her arm but it did not improve when she moved.
27359	0	a	She also noted that it was not in any particular nerve distribution.
27360	0	a	Aside from this deficit, she denies any H/A, LOC, dizziness, blurry vision, facial droop, weakness, or aphasia.
27361	0	a	Her symptoms persisted for about 12 hours and then spontaneously resolved.
27362	0	a	Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.

27514	0	a	While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke.
27515	0	a	These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli.
27516	0	a	Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

27531	0	a	HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
27532	0	a	who presents for routine follow up.
27533	0	a	CURRENT ISSUES:
27534	0	a	1.
27535	0	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
27536	0	a	The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
27537	0	a	     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.
27538	0	a	We discussed 
27539	0	a	     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
27540	0	a	     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
27541	0	a	     tighter control.
27542	0	a	He states he has been following his finger 
27543	0	a	     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this.
27544	0	a	His 
27545	0	a	     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
27546	0	a	     regular.
27547	0	a	At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
27548	0	a	     regular at dinnertime.
27549	0	a	He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
27550	0	a	2.
27551	3	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
27552	0	a	Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
27553	0	a	     rash to his simvastatin.
27554	0	a	This resolved on the discontinuation of 
27555	0	a	     the simvastatin.
27556	2	a	Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
27557	0	a	     January, 2067.
27558	0	a	He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
27559	0	a	     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
27560	0	a	     fats.
27561	0	a	3.
27562	0	a	Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
27563	0	a	The 
27564	0	a	     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
27565	0	a	     Jobst stocking.
27566	0	a	He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
27567	0	a	     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
27568	0	a	     compliant with the stocking.
27569	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.
27570	0	a	Heart rate:  76.
27571	0	a	Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.
27572	0	a	Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and

27578	0	a	the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.
27579	0	a	Foot

27581	0	a	IMPRESSION:                         
27582	0	a	We will increase the patient's 
27583	0	a	     morning NPH dose to 40 units.
27584	0	a	He will once again try to become

27620	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
27621	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in
27622	0	a	transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively
27623	0	a	worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated
27624	0	a	with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday.
27625	0	a	He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,
27626	0	a	progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal
27627	0	a	exertion.
27628	0	a	He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which
27629	0	a	did radiate to his left shoulder.
27630	0	a	This seemed to resolve
27631	0	a	spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind
27632	0	a	of exertion at all.
27633	0	a	The shortness of breath was exclusively
27634	0	a	exertional.
27635	0	a	He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
27636	0	a	presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.
27637	0	a	No fevers.
27638	0	a	He does have a
27639	0	a	slight cough that is nonproductive.
27640	0	a	He was seen at a local
27641	0	a	Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as
27642	0	a	well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states
27643	0	a	he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.
27644	0	a	He was
27645	0	a	cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his
27646	0	a	cardiologist at SAH.
27647	0	a	Additionally, at the outside Emergency
27648	0	a	Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,
27649	0	a	but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.
27650	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally
27651	3	a	controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter.
27652	0	a	He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.
27653	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of
27654	0	a	smoking.
27655	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,
27656	0	a	otherwise negative.
27657	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,
27658	0	a	glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.
27659	0	a	ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.
27660	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate
27661	0	a	20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
27662	0	a	HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
27663	0	a	Pleasant, calm.
27664	0	a	Neck is
27665	0	a	supple.
27666	0	a	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for
27667	0	a	scattered rales in the left lower lung field.
27668	0	a	Cardiovascular: 
27669	0	a	Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
27670	0	a	Abdomen is soft and
27671	0	a	nontender.
27672	0	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
27673	0	a	Extremities:  He has
27674	0	a	got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is
27675	0	a	symmetric.
27676	0	a	Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities
27677	0	a	equally.
27678	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave
27679	0	a	progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.
27680	0	a	Chest x-ray
27681	0	a	shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural
27682	0	a	effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild
27683	0	a	pulmonary edema.
27684	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with
27685	0	a	creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.
27686	0	a	BNP is still pending.
27687	0	a	INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on
27688	0	a	Coumadin.
27689	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency
27690	0	a	Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2
27691	0	a	liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic
27692	0	a	improvement in his dyspnea.
27693	0	a	He has no further episodes of chest
27694	0	a	pain or pressure.
27695	0	a	I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,
27696	0	a	the SAH cardiologist on-call.
27697	0	a	I believe this patient has CHF
27698	0	a	exacerbation.
27699	0	a	He also was recently cardioverted, which ____
27700	0	a	explain his troponin elevation.
27701	0	a	Additionally, his CHF
27702	0	a	exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I
27703	0	a	doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
27704	0	a	At this point,
27705	0	a	the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on
27706	0	a	We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at
27707	0	a	this time.
27708	0	a	However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will
27709	0	a	be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for
27710	0	a	further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart
27711	0	a	failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.
27712	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin
27713	0	a	elevation, and diabetes.
27714	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

27796	0	a	Dear Dr. Keller,
27797	0	a	Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
27798	0	a	Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
27799	0	a	We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.

27894	0	a	Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.
27895	0	a	At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
27896	0	a	Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.
27897	0	a	We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.
27898	0	a	She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.
27899	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
27900	0	a	We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

29071	0	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
29072	0	a	It would be useful to know 
29073	0	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
29074	0	a	It is, of course, also 
29075	0	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
29076	0	a	Their symmetry and 
29077	0	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
29078	0	a	The ACE 
29079	0	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
29080	0	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
29081	0	a	Her loss of appetite and 
29082	0	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
29083	0	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
29084	0	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
29085	0	a	hyperlipidemia.
29086	0	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
29087	0	a	It think it 
29088	0	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
29089	0	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
29090	0	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
29091	0	a	If, of course, shortness of 
29092	0	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
29093	0	a	reasonable.
29094	0	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
29095	0	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
29096	0	a	requirement for Lasix.
29097	0	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
29098	0	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
29099	0	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
29100	0	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
29101	0	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
29102	0	a	Aranesp).
29103	0	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
29104	0	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
29105	0	a	If so, the 
29106	0	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
29107	0	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
29108	0	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
29109	0	a	It would 
29110	0	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
29111	0	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
29112	0	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
29113	0	a	a need for it arises.
29114	0	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
29115	0	a	done in the next few months.
29116	0	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
29117	0	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
29118	0	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
29119	0	a	these measures as necessary.
29120	0	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
29121	0	a	Wanda
29122	0	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
29123	0	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
29124	0	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
29125	0	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

29238	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
29239	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
29240	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
29241	3	a	Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
29242	0	a	She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.
29243	0	a	This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.
29244	0	a	Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
29245	0	a	Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.
29246	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
29247	0	a	She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.
29248	0	a	She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.
29249	0	a	Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.
29250	0	a	She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.
29251	0	a	Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.
29252	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
29253	0	a	Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
29254	0	a	However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.
29255	0	a	She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.
29256	0	a	She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.
29257	0	a	She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.
29258	0	a	She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.
29259	0	a	She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
29260	0	a	"She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

29331	3	a	58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
29332	0	a	She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.
29333	0	a	We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
29334	0	a	The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.
29335	0	a	If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.
29336	3	a	However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.
29337	0	a	Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.
29338	0	a	Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
29339	0	a	Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.
29340	0	a	I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.
29341	0	a	She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
29342	0	a	If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.
29343	0	a	Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.
29344	0	a	Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.
29345	0	a	Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
29346	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
29347	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
29348	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.

29575	0	a	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.
29576	0	a	Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.
29577	0	a	Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.
29578	0	a	I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.
29579	0	a	His murmur is quite impressive.
29580	0	a	Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
29581	0	a	Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors.
29582	0	a	He is also a smoker.
29583	0	a	Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.

29966	0	a	For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible.
29967	0	a	As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27.
29968	0	a	Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy.
29969	0	a	On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
29970	0	a	The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed.

31156	0	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
31157	0	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
31158	0	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
31159	0	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
31160	0	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
31161	0	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
31162	0	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
31163	0	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
31164	0	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

31955	0	a	Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
31956	0	a	Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
31957	0	a	A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 
31958	0	a	""" Hematoma around right subclavian artery."
31959	0	a	Narrowing of the artery.
31960	0	a	Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.
31961	0	a	"If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained."""
31962	0	a	On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
31963	0	a	His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses.
31964	0	a	There are no thrills or bruits.
31965	0	a	My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:
31966	0	a	1).
31967	0	a	Hematoma- to be expected
31968	0	a	2).
31969	0	a	Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
31970	0	a	3).
31971	0	a	Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
31972	0	a	4).
31973	0	a	Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
31974	0	a	Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
31975	0	a	This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
31976	0	a	If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it.
31977	0	a	He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
31978	0	a	There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

32240	0	a	Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811
32241	0	a	Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098
32242	0	a	ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
32243	0	a	Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
32244	0	a	History of Present Illness:
32245	0	a	"	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery."
32246	0	a	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.
32247	0	a	If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
32248	0	a	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
32249	0	a	Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
32250	0	a	His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.
32251	0	a	A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
32252	0	a	There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
32253	0	a	The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).
32254	0	a	An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
32255	0	a	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
32256	0	a	He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
32257	0	a	He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.
32258	0	a	He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
32259	0	a	He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.
32260	0	a	His lasix dose has not changed.
32261	0	a	He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
32262	0	a	He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.
32263	0	a	A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

32349	0	a	Impression and Plan:
32350	0	a	This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
32351	0	a	The issues include:
32352	0	a	Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
32353	0	a	I would consider:
32354	0	a	increasing his diuretic (eg.
32355	0	a	Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
32356	0	a	Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
32357	0	a	He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
32358	0	a	consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
32359	0	a	consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
32360	0	a	Prevention of periperative MI
32361	0	a	He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
32362	0	a	No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
32363	0	a	Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
32364	0	a	Prevention of perioperative AF
32365	0	a	Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
32366	0	a	Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
32367	0	a	Endocarditis prophylaxis
32368	0	a	He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
32369	0	a	We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.
