197	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.
198	0	a	This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
199	0	a	At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
200	0	a	Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
201	0	a	She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
202	0	a	I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
203	0	a	She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
204	0	a	She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
205	0	a	Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.
206	0	a	If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

781	3	a	HPI: Mr. Jain is a 67 year old male with a h/o DM, HTN, HL, Chronic Afib, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneurysm s/p R popliteal thrombosis w/ resultant RLE ischemia and dry gangrene of heel, toes and forefoot.
782	0	a	He has since undergone a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w/ saphenous vein graft and 8mm PTFE w/ angioplasty to the R PTA.
783	0	a	In March of this year he underwent a distal bpg from the R posterior tibial artery to the plantar artery and then a R TMA later that month.
784	0	a	His R TMA has healed well since then.
785	0	a	He is also s/p L fem-pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm.
786	0	a	He saw Dr. Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left, however on the right he appears to have a high-grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft.
787	0	a	The more distal graft on the right, which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent.
788	0	a	He denies recent h/o fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal pain, or neurological sx.

1519	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
1520	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.
1521	0	a	While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.
1522	0	a	He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.
1523	0	a	MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.
1524	0	a	He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.
1525	0	a	After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.
1526	0	a	Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
1527	0	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
1528	0	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
1529	0	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.
1530	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
1531	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.
1532	0	a	He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.
1533	0	a	He feels well, and has had no problems.
1534	0	a	He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.
1535	0	a	He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.
1536	0	a	He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.
1537	0	a	His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.
1538	0	a	His past medical history includes:
1539	0	a	 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
1540	0	a	 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
1541	0	a	 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
1542	0	a	 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
1543	3	a	 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
1544	0	a	 hypothyroid
1545	0	a	 basal cell skin CA
1546	0	a	 nephrolithiasis
1547	0	a	His medications include:
1548	3	a	 Lipitor 80 mg
1549	0	a	 Plavix 75 mg
1550	0	a	 ASA 325 mg po QD
1551	0	a	 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
1552	0	a	 Prilosec 20 mg
1553	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
1554	3	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
1555	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.
1556	0	a	He is now back at work.
1557	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
1558	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
1559	0	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
1560	0	a	He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.
1561	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.
1562	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
1563	0	a	His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.
1564	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
1565	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
1566	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
1567	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
1568	0	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
1569	0	a	He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.
1570	0	a	His recent cardiac tests include: 
1571	0	a	 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
1572	0	a	 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 
1573	0	a	In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.
1574	0	a	He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.
1575	0	a	Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.
1576	0	a	Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.
1577	0	a	Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.
1578	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
1579	0	a	I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.
1580	0	a	We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.
1581	0	a	Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.
1582	0	a	Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.
1583	0	a	At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.
1584	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
1585	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
1586	0	a	Regards,

1879	0	a	Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.

1881	0	a	The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.
1882	0	a	Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.
1883	0	a	They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.

1885	0	a	His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.
1886	0	a	His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.
1887	0	a	They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady.
1888	0	a	About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.
1889	0	a	Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.
1890	0	a	They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.
1891	0	a	Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.
1892	0	a	They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.
1893	0	a	They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.
1894	0	a	In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.

2882	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
2883	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
2884	0	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
2885	0	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
2886	3	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
2887	0	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
2888	0	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
2889	0	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
2890	0	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
2891	0	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
2892	0	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2893	0	a	daily lifelong.
2894	0	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
2895	0	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
2896	0	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
2897	0	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
2898	0	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
2899	0	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
2900	0	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
2901	0	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
2902	0	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
2903	0	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
2904	0	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2905	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
2906	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
2907	0	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
2908	0	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
2909	0	a	b.i.d.
2910	0	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
2911	0	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
2912	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
2913	0	a	There are no bruits.
2914	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
2915	0	a	He was not clubbed.
2916	0	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
2917	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
2918	0	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
2919	0	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
2920	0	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
2921	0	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
2922	0	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
2923	0	a	TSH was also normal.
2924	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
2925	1	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
2926	0	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
2927	0	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
2928	0	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
2929	0	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
2930	0	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
2931	0	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
2932	0	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
2933	0	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
2934	0	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
2935	0	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
2936	0	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
2937	0	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
2938	0	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
2939	0	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
2940	0	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
2941	0	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
2942	0	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
2943	0	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
2944	0	a	Yours sincerely,

3245	0	a	The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF.
3246	0	a	The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear.
3247	0	a	More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI.
3248	0	a	Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT.
3249	0	a	Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion.
3250	0	a	Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
3251	0	a	If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
3252	0	a	Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles.
3253	0	a	Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.
3254	0	a	Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

3599	0	a	Dear Dr. Feldman:
3600	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
3601	0	a	today in the Cardiology clinic.
3602	0	a	As you know, she is a
3603	0	a	very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
3604	3	a	dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
3605	0	a	disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
3606	0	a	echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
3607	0	a	She
3608	0	a	last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
3609	0	a	appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
3610	0	a	Oregon.
3611	0	a	Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
3612	0	a	been doing quite well.
3613	0	a	She states that she has episodes of
3614	0	a	palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
3615	0	a	minutes.
3616	0	a	She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
3617	0	a	no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
3618	0	a	She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.
3619	0	a	Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
3620	0	a	continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.
3621	0	a	states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
3622	0	a	Cessation Program.
3623	0	a	Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
3624	0	a	q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
3625	0	a	q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
3626	0	a	Protonix, and Allegra.
3627	0	a	On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress.
3628	0	a	Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
3629	0	a	beats per minute.
3630	0	a	Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
3631	0	a	edema.
3632	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
3633	0	a	JVP is 8 cm of water.
3634	0	a	Chest is clear to auscultation and
3635	0	a	percussion bilaterally.
3636	0	a	PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
3637	0	a	physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.
3638	0	a	Abdomen
3639	0	a	is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
3640	0	a	Pulse examination is
3641	0	a	normal.
3642	1	a	Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
3643	0	a	ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
3644	0	a	minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
3645	0	a	467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.
3646	0	a	There is a nonspecific Q-wave
3647	0	a	abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
3648	0	a	compared to prior.
3649	0	a	In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.
3650	0	a	Her palpitations and
3651	0	a	likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
3652	0	a	quite acceptable for her.
3653	0	a	Therefore, she wishes no consideration
3654	0	a	of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
3655	0	a	has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
3656	0	a	Regarding
3657	0	a	her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
3658	0	a	well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
3659	0	a	diabetes.
3660	0	a	However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
3661	0	a	LDL.
3662	0	a	Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
3663	0	a	to 40 mg q.h.s.
3664	0	a	I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
3665	0	a	Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
3666	0	a	cardiovascular issues.
3667	0	a	Thank you very much for referring this
3668	0	a	very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
3669	0	a	Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
3670	0	a	preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

3993	0	a	Re:  Verna Cantu
3994	0	a	ESH #:033-98-74
3995	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.
3996	3	a	As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.
3997	0	a	We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.
3998	0	a	She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.
3999	0	a	She is walking each day.
4000	0	a	Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.
4001	0	a	She has no complaints of pain.
4002	0	a	She is eating well.
4003	0	a	She is sleeping well.
4004	0	a	Her incisions have healed nicely.
4005	0	a	Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.
4006	0	a	Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.
4007	0	a	I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.
4008	0	a	Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.
