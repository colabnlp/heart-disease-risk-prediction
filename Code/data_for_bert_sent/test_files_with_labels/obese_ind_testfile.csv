6603,The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.,Other,349-01.xml
6604,"In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.",Other,349-01.xml
6605,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.,Other,349-01.xml
6606,"This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.",Other,349-01.xml
6607,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.,Other,349-01.xml
6608,"She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.",Other,349-01.xml

6611,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.,Other,349-01.xml

6621,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.,Other,349-01.xml
6622,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.,Other,349-01.xml
6623,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.,Other,349-01.xml
6624,There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.,Other,349-01.xml

6669,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.,Other,349-01.xml
