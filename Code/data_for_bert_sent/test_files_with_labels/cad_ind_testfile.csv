3071,Dear Dr. Barron:,Other,138-04.xml
3072,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.,Other,138-04.xml
3073,I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.,event,138-04.xml
3074,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.,Other,138-04.xml
3075,"Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.",Other,138-04.xml
3076,"It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.",symptom,138-04.xml
3077,"On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.",Other,138-04.xml
3078,She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.,event,138-04.xml

3080,"Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.",Other,138-04.xml

3117,"In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.",event,138-04.xml
3118,She did receive drug-eluting stents.,Other,138-04.xml
3119,The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.,event,138-04.xml
3120,"What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.",mention,138-04.xml

3122,"She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.",Other,138-04.xml
3123,I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.,Other,138-04.xml
3124,"To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.",Other,138-04.xml
3125,We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.,Other,138-04.xml

3128,"In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.",Other,138-04.xml
3129,"Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.",Other,138-04.xml
3130,"After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.",Other,138-04.xml
3131,"However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.",Other,138-04.xml
3132,"She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.",Other,138-04.xml
3133,"The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.",Other,138-04.xml
3134,This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.,Other,138-04.xml
3135,"I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.",Other,138-04.xml

3155,We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.,Other,138-05.xml
3156,We utilized the right radial artery for access.,Other,138-05.xml
3157,We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.,event,138-05.xml
3158,This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.,Other,138-05.xml
3159,We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.,event,138-05.xml
3160,The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.,Other,138-05.xml
3161,The final angiographic result was excellent.,Other,138-05.xml
3162,The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.,Other,138-05.xml

7039,"The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.",Other,198-02.xml

11092,We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.,Other,209-01.xml
11093,This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.,Other,209-01.xml
11094,"After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.",Other,209-01.xml
11095,I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.,Other,209-01.xml

11983,Dear Dr. Ussery:,Other,211-02.xml
11984,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.,Other,211-02.xml
11985,"As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.",Other,211-02.xml
11986,He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.,Other,211-02.xml
11987,"By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.",Other,211-02.xml
11988,"He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.",event,211-02.xml
11989,"That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.",Other,211-02.xml
11990,He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.,Other,211-02.xml
11991,"The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.",Other,211-02.xml
11992,Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.,test,211-02.xml
11993,He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.,test,211-02.xml
11994,"This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.",event,211-02.xml
11995,A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.,Other,211-02.xml
11996,He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.,event,211-02.xml
11997,"A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.",Other,211-02.xml
11998,This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.,Other,211-02.xml
11999,His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.,mention,211-02.xml
12000,"Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.",Other,211-02.xml
12001,He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.,Other,211-02.xml
12002,"Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.",event,211-02.xml

12040,Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.,Other,211-02.xml
12041,"He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.",Other,211-02.xml
12042,His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.,Other,211-02.xml
12043,His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.,event,211-02.xml
12044,There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.,Other,211-02.xml
12045,His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.,Other,211-02.xml
12046,"In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.",event,211-02.xml
12047,"Also, his systolic function has improved over time.",Other,211-02.xml
12048,I think there are two processes going on.,Other,211-02.xml
12049,One is coronary artery disease.,mention,211-02.xml
12050,"Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.",event,211-02.xml
12051,The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.,mention,211-02.xml
12052,"Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.",Other,211-02.xml
12053,"He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.",Other,211-02.xml
12054,I suspect that this is myocarditis.,Other,211-02.xml
12055,"Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.",Other,211-02.xml
12056,It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.,Other,211-02.xml
12057,"From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.",mention,211-02.xml
12058,"He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.",Other,211-02.xml
12059,"For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.",Other,211-02.xml
12060,His LDL goal will be less than 100.,Other,211-02.xml
12061,"He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.",Other,211-02.xml
12062,His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.,Other,211-02.xml
12063,I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.,Other,211-02.xml
12064,I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.,Other,211-02.xml

16962,It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.,Other,237-01.xml

21138,She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.,Other,317-01.xml
21139,"However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.",mention,317-01.xml
21140,"As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.",Other,317-01.xml
21141,"Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.",Other,317-01.xml

21143,"During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.",Other,317-01.xml
21144,I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.,Other,317-01.xml

21147,I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.,Other,317-01.xml

21150,It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.,Other,317-01.xml
