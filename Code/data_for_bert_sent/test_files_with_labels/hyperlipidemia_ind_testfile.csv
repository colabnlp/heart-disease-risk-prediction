188,"The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.",Other,112-02.xml

191,His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.,Other,112-02.xml

197,His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.,Other,112-02.xml
198,There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.,Other,112-02.xml
199,"However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.",Other,112-02.xml
200,"Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.",Other,112-02.xml
201,I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.,Other,112-02.xml

3814,Dear Dr. Barron:,Other,138-04.xml
3815,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.,Other,138-04.xml
3816,I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.,Other,138-04.xml
3817,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.,Other,138-04.xml
3818,"Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.",mention,138-04.xml
3819,"It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.",Other,138-04.xml
3820,"On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.",Other,138-04.xml
3821,She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.,Other,138-04.xml
3822,I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.,Other,138-04.xml
3823,"Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.",Other,138-04.xml
3824,"Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.",Other,138-04.xml
3825,"Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.",Other,138-04.xml

3838,"Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.",Other,138-04.xml
3839,Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.,Other,138-04.xml

3842,Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.,Other,138-04.xml
3843,Her weight is 213 pounds.,Other,138-04.xml
3844,Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.,Other,138-04.xml
3845,There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.,Other,138-04.xml
3846,The carotid upstrokes are full.,Other,138-04.xml
3847,Her lungs are clear to auscultation.,Other,138-04.xml
3848,"The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.",Other,138-04.xml
3849,The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.,Other,138-04.xml
3850,"The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.",Other,138-04.xml
3851,Her extremities show no edema.,Other,138-04.xml
3852,Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.,Other,138-04.xml
3853,She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.,Other,138-04.xml
3854,I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.,Other,138-04.xml
3855,"On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.",Other,138-04.xml
3856,She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.,Other,138-04.xml
3857,She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.,Other,138-04.xml
3858,There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.,Other,138-04.xml
3859,She has only mild mitral regurgitation.,Other,138-04.xml
3860,"In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.",Other,138-04.xml
3861,She did receive drug-eluting stents.,Other,138-04.xml
3862,The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.,Other,138-04.xml
3863,"What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.",Other,138-04.xml
3864,"From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.",Other,138-04.xml
3865,"She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.",Other,138-04.xml
3866,I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.,Other,138-04.xml
3867,"To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.",Other,138-04.xml
3868,We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.,Other,138-04.xml
3869,"In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.",Other,138-04.xml
3870,The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.,Other,138-04.xml
3871,"In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.",Other,138-04.xml
3872,"Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.",Other,138-04.xml
3873,"After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.",Other,138-04.xml
3874,"However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.",Other,138-04.xml
3875,"She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.",Other,138-04.xml
3876,"The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.",Other,138-04.xml
3877,This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.,Other,138-04.xml
3878,"I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.",Other,138-04.xml

7817,"The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.",Other,198-02.xml

7819,The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.,Other,198-02.xml
7820,"Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.",Other,198-02.xml

7822,"Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).",Other,198-02.xml

11503,Dear Dr. Ussery:,Other,211-02.xml
11504,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.,Other,211-02.xml
11505,"As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.",Other,211-02.xml
11506,He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.,Other,211-02.xml
11507,"By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.",Other,211-02.xml
11508,"He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.",Other,211-02.xml
11509,"That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.",Other,211-02.xml
11510,He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.,Other,211-02.xml
11511,"The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.",Other,211-02.xml
11512,Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.,Other,211-02.xml
11513,He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.,Other,211-02.xml
11514,"This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.",Other,211-02.xml
11515,A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.,Other,211-02.xml
11516,He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.,Other,211-02.xml
11517,"A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.",Other,211-02.xml
11518,This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.,Other,211-02.xml
11519,His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.,Other,211-02.xml
11520,"Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.",Other,211-02.xml
11521,He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.,Other,211-02.xml
11522,"Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.",Other,211-02.xml
11523,He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.,Other,211-02.xml
11524,"He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.",Other,211-02.xml
11525,He has felt very well.,Other,211-02.xml
11526,"He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.",Other,211-02.xml
11527,His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.,Other,211-02.xml
11528,"Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.",Other,211-02.xml
11529,He was evaluated and released.,Other,211-02.xml
11530,He never had any further testing.,Other,211-02.xml
11531,"He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.",Other,211-02.xml
11532,"Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.",mention,211-02.xml
11533,"His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.",mention,211-02.xml
11534,He has no known drug allergies.,Other,211-02.xml
11535,"Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.",Other,211-02.xml

20731,The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.,Other,349-01.xml
20732,"In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.",Other,349-01.xml
20733,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.,Other,349-01.xml
20734,"This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.",Other,349-01.xml
20735,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.,Other,349-01.xml
20736,"She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.",Other,349-01.xml
20737,The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.,Other,349-01.xml

20739,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.,Other,349-01.xml

20748,"Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.",Other,349-01.xml
20749,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.,Other,349-01.xml
20750,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.,Other,349-01.xml
20751,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.,Other,349-01.xml

20797,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.,Other,349-01.xml

23085,Dear Harry and Yair:,Other,377-01.xml
23086,My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.,Other,377-01.xml
23087,"As you know, she is just 52 years of age.",Other,377-01.xml
23088,"Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.",mention,377-01.xml
23089,She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.,Other,377-01.xml
23090,She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.,Other,377-01.xml
23091,She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.,Other,377-01.xml
23092,On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.,Other,377-01.xml
23093,"This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.",Other,377-01.xml
23094,In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.,Other,377-01.xml
23095,There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.,Other,377-01.xml
23096,She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.,Other,377-01.xml
23097,"By last spring, i.e.",Other,377-01.xml
23098,a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.,Other,377-01.xml
23099,She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.,Other,377-01.xml
23100,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.,Other,377-01.xml
23101,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.,Other,377-01.xml
23102,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???,Other,377-01.xml
23103,length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.,Other,377-01.xml
23104,Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.,Other,377-01.xml
23105,She has sought an opinion here in this regard.,Other,377-01.xml
23106,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.,Other,377-01.xml
23107,On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.,Other,377-01.xml
23108,Pulse was 70 and regular.,Other,377-01.xml
23109,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.,Other,377-01.xml
23110,"She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.",Other,377-01.xml
23111,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.,Other,377-01.xml
23112,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.,Other,377-01.xml
23113,This is of course a very unhappy situation.,Other,377-01.xml
23114,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.,Other,377-01.xml
23115,However I am not absolutely ruling this out.,Other,377-01.xml
23116,I would suggest the following.,Other,377-01.xml
23117,"Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.",Other,377-01.xml
23118,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.,Other,377-01.xml
23119,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.,Other,377-01.xml
23120,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.,Other,377-01.xml
23121,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.,Other,377-01.xml
23122,My thanks once again.,Other,377-01.xml
