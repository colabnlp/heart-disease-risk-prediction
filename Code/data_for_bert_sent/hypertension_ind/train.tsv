176	0	a	76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.
177	0	a	Source of bleeding not clear.
178	0	a	Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.

180	0	a	No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.
181	0	a	Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.
182	0	a	Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.

337	0	a	ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.
338	0	a	Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.
339	0	a	Past medical records.
340	0	a	History of Present Illness  
341	0	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
342	0	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
343	0	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
344	0	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
345	0	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
346	0	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
347	0	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
348	0	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
349	0	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
350	0	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
351	0	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
352	0	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
353	0	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
354	0	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.
355	0	a	He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.
356	0	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
357	0	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
358	0	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
359	0	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
360	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
361	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
362	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
363	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
364	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
365	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
366	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
367	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
368	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
369	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
370	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
371	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
372	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
373	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).

562	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
563	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
564	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
565	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
566	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
567	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
568	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
569	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
570	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

580	0	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
581	0	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
582	0	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
583	0	a	hypoglycemia).
584	0	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
585	0	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
586	0	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
587	0	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
588	0	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
589	0	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
590	0	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."

856	0	a	NPH 30 at bedtime
857	0	a	QID Regular sliding scale
858	0	a	These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
859	0	a	I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
860	0	a	I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
861	0	a	Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
862	0	a	He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency.
863	0	a	If you agree, would start iron repletion.

932	0	a	He had no chest pain.
933	0	a	Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct.
934	0	a	LV function was normal.
935	0	a	EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.
936	0	a	Assessment and plan:
937	0	a	   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.
938	0	a	He underwent stenting of his LAD.
939	0	a	Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.
940	0	a	He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.
941	0	a	Blood pressure is fine today.
942	0	a	Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.
943	0	a	He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.
944	0	a	He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.
945	0	a	He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.
946	0	a	As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

954	0	a	The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.
955	0	a	I confirmed her history
956	0	a	and physical.
957	0	a	I also interviewed and examined the patient.
958	0	a	Please see the note for more details.
959	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with
960	2	a	a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2
961	0	a	weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with
962	0	a	stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.
963	0	a	The
964	0	a	patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this
965	0	a	ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest
966	0	a	discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous
967	0	a	episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with
968	0	a	activity.
969	0	a	He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented
970	0	a	for further evaluation and treatment.
971	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and
972	0	a	Altace.
973	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,
974	0	a	chest pain free.
975	0	a	Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,
976	0	a	and O2 saturation 98% on room air.
977	0	a	His lungs are clear to
978	0	a	auscultation.
979	0	a	Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
980	0	a	Abdomen is soft
981	0	a	and nontender.
982	0	a	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
983	0	a	No
984	0	a	elevated JVP.
985	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right
986	0	a	bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic
987	0	a	changes.
988	0	a	IV access was established.
989	0	a	Labs were sent revealing
990	0	a	essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.
991	0	a	Initial troponin was
992	0	a	less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was
993	0	a	normal.
994	0	a	The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival.
995	0	a	Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional
996	0	a	beta-blockade was given to the patient.
997	0	a	However, based on his
998	0	a	story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given
999	0	a	Lovenox in the emergency room.
1000	0	a	I spoke to the Cardiology B
1001	0	a	attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his
1002	0	a	service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future.
1003	0	a	With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a
1004	0	a	diagnosis of unstable angina.
1005	0	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

1195	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1196	0	a	(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.
1197	0	a	This is probably due to her
1198	0	a	     spinal stenosis.
1199	0	a	However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
1200	2	a	     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
1201	0	a	We will check lower extremity noninvasive
1202	0	a	     arterial studies to rule out claudication.
1203	0	a	She can take the Vioxx p.r.n.
1204	0	a	for her
1205	0	a	     foot pain which I do not think is related.
1206	0	a	(2)  Type 2 diabetes.
1207	0	a	She needs a hemoglobin A1c.
1208	0	a	Her blood pressure ideally
1209	0	a	     should be under 130/85.
1210	0	a	She reports that it is consistently below that level
1211	0	a	     when her daughter checks it.
1212	0	a	She needs as chem-7.

1214	0	a	     neuropathy at this time.
1215	0	a	(3)  Health maintenance.
1216	0	a	She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today.
1217	0	a	Will check stool guaiacs x 3.
1218	0	a	We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.
1219	0	a	She will follow
1220	0	a	up in six months and p.r.n.
1221	0	a	She was given a
1222	0	a	tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

1329	0	a	Record date: 2071-11-20
1330	0	a	Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
1331	0	a	Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D.
1332	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.
1333	0	a	HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.
1334	0	a	"The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand."
1335	0	a	This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
1336	0	a	Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
1337	0	a	He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.
1338	0	a	Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
1339	0	a	He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
1340	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.
1341	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.
1342	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
1343	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.
1344	0	a	Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
1345	0	a	There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
1346	0	a	very weak opponens.
1347	0	a	He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.
1348	0	a	His interossei and extensors are full.
1349	0	a	Sensation is intact throughout.
1350	0	a	EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.
1351	0	a	IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
1352	0	a	At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
1353	0	a	Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
1354	0	a	possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
1355	0	a	We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
1356	0	a	We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
1357	0	a	We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

1369	0	a	PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
1370	0	a	Reason for visit:
1371	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
1372	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
1373	0	a	Interval History:
1374	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
1375	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
1376	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
1377	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
1378	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
1379	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
1380	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
1381	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
1382	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
1383	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
1384	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
1385	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
1386	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
1387	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
1388	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
1389	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
1390	0	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
1391	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
1392	0	a	Lasix 20mg
1393	0	a	Toprol XL 50mg
1394	0	a	ASA 325mg
1395	0	a	Zestril 20mg
1396	0	a	Lantus 10 units hs
1397	0	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
1398	0	a	Multivitamin
1399	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
1400	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
1401	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

1439	0	a	EKG:
1440	0	a	   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.
1441	0	a	Impression:
1442	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
1443	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
1444	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
1445	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
1446	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
1447	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
1448	0	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
1449	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.

1650	0	a	Dear Dr. Mcmahon:
1651	0	a	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.
1652	2	a	He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.
1653	0	a	Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.
1654	0	a	The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.
1655	0	a	The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.
1656	0	a	There were no complications.
1657	0	a	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.
1658	0	a	His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.
1659	0	a	Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.
1660	0	a	Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.
1661	0	a	He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
1662	0	a	He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.
1663	0	a	His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.
1664	0	a	He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.
1665	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.
1666	0	a	Please call if you have questions.

2510	0	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
2511	0	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
2512	0	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
2513	0	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
2514	0	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
2515	0	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
2516	0	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
2517	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
2518	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
2519	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
2520	0	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
2521	0	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
2522	0	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
2523	0	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
2524	0	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
2525	0	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
2526	0	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
2527	0	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
2528	0	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
2529	0	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
2530	0	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
2531	0	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
2532	0	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
2533	0	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
2534	0	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
2535	0	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
2536	0	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
2537	0	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
2538	0	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
2539	0	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
2540	0	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
2541	0	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
2542	0	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
2543	0	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
2544	0	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
2545	0	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
2546	0	a	He is unable to work.
2547	0	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
2548	0	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
2549	0	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
2550	0	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
2551	0	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
2552	0	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
2553	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
2554	0	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
2555	0	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
2556	0	a	His hair has now grown back.
2557	0	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
2558	0	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
2559	0	a	Eye contact is good.
2560	0	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
2561	0	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
2562	0	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
2563	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
2564	0	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
2565	0	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
2566	0	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
2567	0	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
2568	0	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
2569	0	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
2570	0	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
2571	0	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
2572	0	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
2573	0	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
2574	0	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
2575	0	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
2576	0	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
2577	0	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
2578	0	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
2579	0	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
2580	0	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
2581	0	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
2582	0	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
2583	0	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
2584	0	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
2585	0	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
2586	0	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
2587	0	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
2588	0	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

3275	0	a	Dear Dr. Yancy: 
3276	0	a	  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
3277	2	a	Her history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia.
3278	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective.
3279	0	a	She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years.
3280	0	a	She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago.
3281	0	a	"She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved."

3352	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
3353	0	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
3354	0	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
3355	0	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
3356	0	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
3357	0	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
3358	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

3859	0	a	Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.
3860	0	a	No acute intracranial process.
3861	0	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
3862	2	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
3863	0	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
3864	0	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
3865	0	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
3866	0	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
3867	0	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
3868	0	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
3869	0	a	Recommendations:
3870	0	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
3871	0	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
3872	0	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
3873	0	a	-Continue statin.
3874	0	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

4360	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  
4361	0	a	The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.
4362	0	a	To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.
4363	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
4364	0	a	1.
4365	0	a	Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
4366	0	a	This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
4367	0	a	I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
4368	0	a	I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
4369	0	a	This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
4370	0	a	These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
4371	0	a	I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.
4372	0	a	The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.
4373	0	a	However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.
4374	0	a	I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
4375	0	a	However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.
4376	0	a	I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
4377	0	a	2.
4378	0	a	Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
4379	0	a	If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.
4380	0	a	He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
4381	0	a	The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
4382	0	a	In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.
4383	0	a	At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.
4384	0	a	At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.
4385	0	a	The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
4386	0	a	Sincerely,

4417	0	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
4418	0	a	History of Present Illness
4419	0	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
4420	0	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
4421	0	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
4422	0	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
4423	0	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
4424	0	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
4425	0	a	There was no PCI option available.
4426	0	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
4427	0	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
4428	0	a	He now presented for cath.
4429	0	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
4430	0	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
4431	0	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
4432	0	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
4433	0	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
4434	0	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
4435	0	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
4436	0	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
4437	0	a	He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

4544	0	a	He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).
4545	0	a	He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.
4546	0	a	His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.

4625	0	a	   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.

4627	0	a	He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.

4630	0	a	Plan.
4631	0	a	1.
4632	0	a	CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.
4633	0	a	He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).
4634	0	a	2.
4635	0	a	LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.
4636	0	a	3.
4637	0	a	DM-followed by Dr. Orton.

4640	0	a	Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.

4800	0	a	Sed     one cast with dense pigmented inclusion (?cells),otherwise bland.
4801	0	a	Impression and Plan
4802	0	a	Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy.
4803	0	a	Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration.
4804	0	a	However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration.
4805	0	a	Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.
4806	0	a	I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies.
4807	0	a	Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment.
4808	0	a	For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.
4809	0	a	Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.
4810	0	a	At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

4817	0	a	He RTC.
4818	0	a	HPI: This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb. 02 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr. Yamaguchi.
4819	0	a	However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril.
4820	0	a	I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 100 mg BID.
4821	0	a	Despite some confusion I believe he has done this.
4822	0	a	He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns.

4883	0	a	     MRN: 948-59-58-0
4884	0	a	Dear Miles:
4885	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.
4886	0	a	This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
4887	2	a	history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
4888	0	a	prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
4889	0	a	post total knee replacement.
4890	0	a	He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
4891	0	a	coronary artery disease.
4892	0	a	His history of coronary artery disease
4893	0	a	begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
4894	0	a	in June of 2091.
4895	0	a	In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
4896	0	a	and sat down.
4897	0	a	He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
4898	0	a	consciousness or edema.
4899	0	a	Workup at that time included a thallium
4900	0	a	test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
4901	0	a	echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.
4902	0	a	He began therapy
4903	0	a	at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
4904	0	a	Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.
4905	0	a	He had
4906	0	a	been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
4907	0	a	nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
4908	0	a	until this past spring.
4909	0	a	He actually had done very well with risk
4910	0	a	factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
4911	0	a	following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
4912	0	a	weight.
4913	0	a	In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
4914	0	a	up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
4915	0	a	discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.
4916	0	a	He stopped
4917	0	a	working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
4918	0	a	nitrate therapy.
4919	0	a	Since that time he has noted that he has had
4920	0	a	significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
4921	0	a	actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
4922	0	a	taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.
4923	0	a	He does note
4924	0	a	fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
4925	0	a	night.
4926	0	a	He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
4927	0	a	dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
4928	0	a	Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
4929	0	a	Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.
4930	0	a	He has no known drug
4931	0	a	allergies.
4932	0	a	On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
4933	1	a	noted to be 220/100.
4934	1	a	At the present time it is 180/100 with a
4935	0	a	Vicente, Kadeem F.
4936	0	a	MRN: 948-59-58-0
4937	0	a	Page Two
4938	0	a	heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.
4939	0	a	There is no
4940	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
4941	0	a	His carotids are free of
4942	0	a	bruits.
4943	0	a	His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
4944	0	a	and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
4945	0	a	physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.
4946	0	a	Abdominal
4947	0	a	exam is notable for a ventral hernia.
4948	0	a	There is no organomegaly and
4949	0	a	neither are there bruits present.
4950	0	a	Lower extremities are notable
4951	0	a	for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
4952	0	a	pulses with no edema.
4953	0	a	Skin exam is notable only for the senile
4954	0	a	angioma.
4955	0	a	Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
4956	0	a	is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.
4957	0	a	MIBI was
4958	0	a	notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
4959	0	a	significant ischemia on 5/6/94.
4960	0	a	The ejection fraction on a gated
4961	0	a	spect was 57%.
4962	0	a	In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
4963	0	a	myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
4964	0	a	March of 2094.
4965	0	a	He could, however, also have developed his
4966	0	a	progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
4967	0	a	his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.
4968	0	a	I will
4969	0	a	be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.
4970	0	a	In
4971	0	a	either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
4972	0	a	regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
4973	0	a	pressure.
4974	0	a	I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
4975	0	a	and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
4976	0	a	increase to 60 mg p.o.
4977	0	a	q.d.
4978	0	a	I also would consider further decrease
4979	0	a	of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
4980	0	a	assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program.
4981	0	a	Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
4982	0	a	activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route.
4983	0	a	I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
4984	0	a	hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
4985	0	a	risk factor reduction.
4986	0	a	I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you.
4987	0	a	It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
4988	0	a	Sincerely,

5093	0	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
5094	0	a	MRN: 453-39-84-4
5095	0	a	Dear Dr.
5096	0	a	Craft:
5097	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.
5098	0	a	This lovely gentleman continues to see
5099	0	a	both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.
5100	0	a	I have discussed this with Dr.
5101	0	a	Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all
5102	0	a	would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.
5103	0	a	He notes that
5104	0	a	his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed
5105	0	a	closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium
5106	0	a	chloride doses.
5107	0	a	He has had no shortness of breath at rest.
5108	0	a	He
5109	0	a	has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema.
5110	0	a	He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
5111	0	a	His
5112	0	a	medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO
5113	0	a	b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,
5114	0	a	Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5
5115	0	a	mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d.
5116	0	a	in
5117	0	a	addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.
5118	1	a	His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right
5119	0	a	and left arm seated.
5120	0	a	After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right
5121	0	a	His heart rate is 70 and regular.
5122	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
5123	0	a	His room air saturation is 95%.
5124	0	a	lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are
5125	0	a	somewhat distant.
5126	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for
5127	0	a	nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.
5128	0	a	abdomen is soft and nontender.
5129	0	a	Extremities are notable for edema
5130	0	a	to his knees bilaterally.
5131	0	a	MRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 
5132	0	a	Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14
5133	0	a	and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
5134	0	a	No
5135	0	a	change from prior electrocardiograms.
5136	0	a	In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing
5137	0	a	congestive heart failure.
5138	0	a	His pulmonary evaluation here was
5139	0	a	notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive
5140	0	a	pulmonary dysfunction.
5141	0	a	I would certainly concur with continued
5142	0	a	diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and
5143	0	a	creatinine.
5144	0	a	If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.
5145	0	a	Sincerely,
5146	0	a	Corrine James-Wagner, M.D.

5661	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
5662	2	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
5663	0	a	She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.
5664	0	a	##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
5665	0	a	Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.
5666	0	a	A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
5667	0	a	Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.
5668	0	a	Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
5669	0	a	Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.
5670	0	a	Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
5671	0	a	Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
5672	0	a	Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
5673	0	a	Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion
5674	0	a	Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
5675	0	a	##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
5676	0	a	Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.
5677	0	a	Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
5678	0	a	Check orthostatics
5679	0	a	Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.
5680	0	a	Monitor on telemetry.
5681	0	a	Physical therapy consult.
5682	0	a	##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.
5683	0	a	Fe, TIBC, ferritin
5684	0	a	Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia
5685	0	a	##: Elevated anion gap.
5686	0	a	Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.
5687	0	a	Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.
5688	0	a	There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.
5689	0	a	pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.
5690	0	a	AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).
5691	0	a	Check lactate
5692	0	a	Repeat AG
5693	0	a	##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.
5694	0	a	UA and CXR were negative.
5695	0	a	If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.
5696	0	a	Repeat CBC
5697	0	a	##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide

5901	0	a	DATE OF Consultation: 3/08/76
5902	0	a	PATIENT ID: Mr. Quin is a 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 met with pain who is seen for consideration of radiation therapy.
5903	0	a	HPI:  
5904	0	a	Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).
5905	0	a	He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.
5906	0	a	His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.
5907	0	a	The patient recalls 37 treatments.
5908	0	a	The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.
5909	0	a	He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5.
5910	0	a	In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.
5911	0	a	He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.
5912	0	a	His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.
5913	0	a	He is incontinent from his surgery.
5914	0	a	In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).
5915	0	a	The patient's LLP worsened.
5916	0	a	He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.
5917	0	a	On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.
5918	0	a	The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room.

6688	0	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
6689	0	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
6690	0	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
6691	0	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
6692	0	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
6693	1	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
6694	2	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
6695	0	a	Will discuss with Drs.
6696	0	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
6697	0	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
6698	0	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
6699	0	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
6700	0	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
6701	0	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
6702	0	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
6703	0	a	Follow sugars while in house
6704	0	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

6718	0	a	Dear Quin,
6719	0	a	Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.
6720	2	a	As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083.
6721	0	a	She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.
6722	0	a	She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.
6723	0	a	An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.
6724	0	a	Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.
6725	0	a	At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.
6726	0	a	Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.
6727	0	a	Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.
6728	0	a	There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
6729	0	a	After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.
6730	0	a	"She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s."
6731	0	a	She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.
6732	0	a	She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.
6733	0	a	It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.
6734	0	a	A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.
6735	0	a	With best regards.
6736	0	a	Sincerely yours,

7423	0	a	Dear Fitzgerald:
7424	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
7425	0	a	As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
7426	0	a	At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.
7427	0	a	The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
7428	0	a	The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.
7429	0	a	There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
7430	0	a	He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
7431	0	a	At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
7432	0	a	That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.
7433	0	a	The right side was patent.
7434	0	a	With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.
7435	0	a	The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
7436	0	a	The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.
7437	0	a	Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
7438	0	a	There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
7439	0	a	The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
7440	0	a	He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.
7441	0	a	The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
7442	0	a	He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
7443	0	a	Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.
7444	0	a	This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
7445	0	a	The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
7446	0	a	He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.
7447	0	a	Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
7448	0	a	He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
7449	0	a	He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.
7450	0	a	The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
7451	0	a	His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
7452	0	a	He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
7453	0	a	He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.
7454	0	a	Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
7455	0	a	He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
7456	0	a	He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.
7457	0	a	Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
7458	0	a	"Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
7459	0	a	At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.
7460	0	a	Past medical history:

7533	0	a	Other Data:
7534	0	a	   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
7535	0	a	Assessment and plan:
7536	0	a	   1.
7537	0	a	Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.
7538	0	a	This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
7539	0	a	I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.
7540	0	a	Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
7541	0	a	We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
7542	0	a	I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.
7543	0	a	Impression:
7544	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.
7545	0	a	We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.
7546	0	a	Right leg has not been examined in the past.
7547	0	a	Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.
7548	0	a	Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
7549	0	a	Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
7550	0	a	Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
7551	0	a	If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.
7552	0	a	He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.
7553	0	a	Coronary artery disease - stable.
7554	0	a	Diabetes.
7555	0	a	Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

8363	0	a	ASSESSMENT
8364	2	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
8365	0	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
8366	0	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
8367	0	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
8368	0	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
8369	0	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
8370	0	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
8371	0	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
8372	0	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
8373	0	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
8374	0	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
8375	0	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
8376	0	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
8377	0	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
8378	0	a	PLAN
8379	0	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
8380	0	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
8381	0	a	-D/c naproxen use.
8382	0	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
8383	0	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
8384	0	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
8385	0	a	#) DM
8386	0	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

8580	0	a	Cardiology.
8581	0	a	Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant.
8582	0	a	Rule out 
8583	0	a	osteoporosis.
8584	0	a	HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
8585	0	a	diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.
8586	0	a	At 
8587	0	a	the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
8588	0	a	Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
8589	0	a	but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
8590	0	a	approximately 26 weeks.
8591	0	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
8592	0	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
8593	0	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
8594	0	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
8595	0	a	Subsequently he 
8596	0	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
8597	0	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
8598	0	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.
8599	0	a	He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
8600	0	a	100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
8601	0	a	Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.
8602	0	a	The patient's 
8603	0	a	complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.
8604	0	a	There is 
8605	0	a	no peripheral neuropathy.
8606	0	a	There is no autonomic neuropathy.
8607	0	a	No retinal 
8608	0	a	disease.
8609	0	a	However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
8610	0	a	creatinine currently of 2.4.
8611	0	a	Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
8612	0	a	symptoms in the early 80s.
8613	0	a	By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
8614	0	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
8615	0	a	2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
8616	0	a	infarctions.
8617	0	a	In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
8618	0	a	transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.
8619	0	a	Since 
8620	0	a	that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
8621	0	a	with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
8622	0	a	degree of symptoms.
8623	0	a	The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
8624	0	a	day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.
8625	0	a	Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
8626	0	a	twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
8627	0	a	mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.
8628	0	a	Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
8629	0	a	was from a trauma some years ago.
8630	0	a	Other past medical history includes 
8631	0	a	history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

8719	0	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
8720	0	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
8721	0	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
8722	0	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
8723	0	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
8724	0	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
8725	0	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
8726	0	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
8727	0	a	patients.
8728	0	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
8729	0	a	this makes sense.
8730	0	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
8731	0	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
8732	0	a	reasons.
8733	0	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
8734	0	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
8735	0	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
8736	0	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
8737	0	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
8738	0	a	We would be a little 
8739	0	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
8740	0	a	without more information about this patient.
8741	0	a	The patient's diabetes 
8742	0	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
8743	0	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
8744	0	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
8745	0	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
8746	0	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
8747	0	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
8748	0	a	situation.
8749	0	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

8814	2	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
8815	0	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
8816	0	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
8817	0	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
8818	0	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
8819	0	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
8820	0	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
8821	0	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
8822	0	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
8823	0	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
8824	0	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
8825	0	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
8826	0	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
8827	0	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
8828	0	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
8829	0	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
8830	0	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.
8831	0	a	Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

9031	0	a	Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides.
9032	0	a	Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty.
9033	0	a	He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.

9105	0	a	PLAN:
9106	0	a	1.
9107	0	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
9108	0	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
9109	0	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
9110	0	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
9111	0	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
9112	0	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
9113	0	a	2.
9114	0	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
9115	0	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
9116	0	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
9117	0	a	3.
9118	0	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
9119	0	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
9120	0	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
9121	0	a	4.
9122	0	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
9123	0	a	5.
9124	0	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
9125	0	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

9130	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
9131	0	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
9132	0	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
9133	0	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
9134	0	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
9135	0	a	His options are:
9136	0	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
9137	0	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
9138	0	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
9139	0	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

9353	0	a	To Whom It May Concern:
9354	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
9355	1	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
9356	0	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
9357	0	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
9358	0	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
9359	0	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
9360	0	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
9361	0	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
9362	0	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
9363	0	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
9364	1	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
9365	0	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
9366	0	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
9367	1	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.
9368	0	a	Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
9369	0	a	daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
9370	0	a	daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
9371	0	a	daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o.
9372	0	a	daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
9373	0	a	daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o.
9374	0	a	daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
9375	0	a	daily.
9376	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
9377	0	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
9378	0	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
9379	0	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
9380	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
9381	1	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
9382	0	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
9383	0	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
9384	0	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
9385	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
9386	0	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
9387	0	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
9388	0	a	He has good distal pulsations.
9389	0	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
9390	0	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
9391	0	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
9392	0	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
9393	0	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
9394	0	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
9395	1	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
9396	0	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
9397	0	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
9398	0	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
9399	1	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
9400	0	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
9401	0	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
9402	0	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
9403	0	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
9404	0	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
9405	0	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
9406	0	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
9407	0	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
9408	0	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
9409	0	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
9410	0	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
9411	1	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
9412	1	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
9413	0	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
9414	0	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
9415	0	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
9416	0	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
9417	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
9418	0	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
9419	0	a	Thank you.
9420	0	a	Sincerely,

10428	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
10429	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
10430	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
10431	2	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
10432	0	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
10433	0	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
10434	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
10435	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
10436	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
10437	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
10438	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
10439	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
10440	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

10486	0	a	Tandem gait intact.
10487	0	a	Romberg negative.
10488	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
10489	2	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
10490	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
10491	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
10492	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
10493	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
10494	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
10495	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
10496	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
10497	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
10498	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
10499	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
10500	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
10501	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
10502	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
10503	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
10504	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
10505	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
10506	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

11365	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
11366	2	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.
11367	0	a	Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.
11368	0	a	She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.
11369	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.
11370	0	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o.
11371	0	a	q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o.
11372	0	a	q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o.
11373	0	a	q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o.
11374	0	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o.
11375	0	a	q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o.
11376	0	a	q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.
11377	1	a	Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.
11378	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the exam table.
11379	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.
11380	0	a	There are very rare crackles at the bases.
11381	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.
11382	0	a	P2 is increased.
11383	0	a	There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.
11384	0	a	She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.
11385	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.
11386	0	a	There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.
11387	0	a	In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.
11388	0	a	She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.
11389	2	a	In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o.
11390	0	a	q.d.
11391	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.
11392	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.
11393	0	a	It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.
11394	0	a	Sincerely yours,

11769	0	a	He has been noting some
11770	0	a	decreased depth perception and visual acuity.
11771	0	a	At the same time,
11772	0	a	he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he

11778	0	a	came back at 10.2.
11779	0	a	Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I
11780	0	a	had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

11828	0	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
11829	0	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
11830	0	a	diabetes.
11831	0	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

11842	0	a	He is asked
11843	0	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
11844	0	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens
11845	0	a	swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.
11846	0	a	I assume that this
11847	0	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.

12464	0	a	   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.
12465	0	a	Interval History:
12466	0	a	   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097.
12467	0	a	At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion.
12468	0	a	Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization.
12469	0	a	Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD.
12470	0	a	He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation.
12471	0	a	Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease.
12472	0	a	He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer.
12473	0	a	His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch.
12474	0	a	He required re-exploration for bleeding.
12475	0	a	He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone.
12476	0	a	His IABP was removed a few days post operatively.
12477	0	a	He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%.
12478	0	a	He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab.
12479	0	a	Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV.
12480	0	a	The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD.
12481	0	a	He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents.
12482	0	a	His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function.
12483	0	a	He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability.
12484	0	a	He was followed by Dr. Hardin.
12485	0	a	His HIT assay was borderline negative.
12486	0	a	He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban.
12487	0	a	Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux.
12488	0	a	A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation.
12489	0	a	He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20.
12490	0	a	He was discharged from rehab on June 5th.

12710	0	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.

12720	0	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.

12817	0	a	On physical examination, he was obese.
12818	1	a	Blood pressure of 150/90
12819	0	a	with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
12820	0	a	5 pounds from September 21st.
12821	0	a	Chest was clear to auscultation and
12822	0	a	percussion.
12823	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-

12831	0	a	There is no hepatojugular reflux.

12842	0	a	Unfortunately, he did

12845	0	a	I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion

12934	0	a	HPI:  Patient is a 59-year old who has a history or active issues 
12935	2	a	significant for hypertension first diagnosed on visit of 10-74.
12936	0	a	She is 
12937	0	a	currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
12938	0	a	q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml.
12939	0	a	equivalents PO q.d.
12940	0	a	Patient comes in 
12941	0	a	today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
12942	0	a	baseline examinations.
12943	1	a	On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
12944	1	a	and on check today it was 150/90.
12945	0	a	We discussed the possibility that she 
12946	0	a	continue her salt-restricted diet.
12947	0	a	We also discussed that she continue 
12948	0	a	her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
12949	0	a	the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.
12950	0	a	She currently 
12951	0	a	weighs 199 lbs.
12952	0	a	"and stands approximately 4'9"" tall."
12953	0	a	As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
12954	0	a	pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
12955	0	a	time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
12956	0	a	XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
12957	0	a	gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.
12958	0	a	However, at 
12959	0	a	this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
12960	0	a	and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
12961	0	a	pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
12962	1	a	200s-190s.
12963	0	a	Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
12964	0	a	now appears to be much more stable.
12965	0	a	She is currently living with her 
12966	0	a	mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
12967	0	a	about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.
12968	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.
12969	0	a	Heart: RRR, no 
12970	0	a	murmurs.
12971	0	a	Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
12972	0	a	tenderness.
12973	0	a	She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
12974	0	a	swelling bilaterally at the ankles.
12975	0	a	Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
12976	0	a	or lumps.
12977	0	a	She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
12978	0	a	mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
12979	0	a	guaiacs.
12980	0	a	Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
12981	0	a	issue at this point.

13179	0	a	Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
13180	0	a	Background:
13181	2	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
13182	0	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
13183	0	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
13184	0	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
13185	0	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
13186	0	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
13187	0	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
13188	0	a	Slowly these lesions healed.
13189	0	a	Interim Issues:
13190	2	a	The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
13191	0	a	But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
13192	0	a	In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
13193	0	a	Recovering from surgery has been slow.
13194	0	a	But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
13195	0	a	She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home.
13196	0	a	She has had no recurrent chest pain.
13197	0	a	She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
13198	0	a	She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se.
13199	0	a	She healed well postoperatively.
13200	0	a	She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
13201	0	a	Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
13202	0	a	In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's.
13203	0	a	She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
13204	0	a	What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
13205	0	a	She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
13206	0	a	She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
13207	0	a	She has had no worsening swallowing.
13208	0	a	She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
13209	0	a	She sleeps on two pillows.
13210	0	a	She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
13211	0	a	She continues on omeprazole.
13212	0	a	Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.
13213	0	a	MEDS:
13214	0	a	Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
13215	0	a	Aspirin  325 MG QD  
13216	0	a	Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD

13236	0	a	She has telangiectasias over her face.
13237	0	a	She looks well to me.
13238	0	a	Her color is good and she smiles easily.
13239	0	a	She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes.
13240	0	a	Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here.
13241	0	a	Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well.
13242	0	a	But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma.
13243	0	a	The midline scar has healed beautifully.
13244	0	a	The respiratory excursions appear full.
13245	0	a	There is no splinting.
13246	0	a	There are some bilateral crackles.
13247	0	a	Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease.
13248	0	a	There are no nail bed infarcts.
13249	0	a	There is some peripheral pitting of digits.
13250	0	a	Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused.

13264	0	a	I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks.
13265	0	a	Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained.
13266	0	a	I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim.

13298	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4
13299	0	a	Dear Usha:
13300	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in
13301	0	a	my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary
13302	0	a	artery bypass surgery.
13303	0	a	As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a
13304	0	a	terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest
13305	0	a	discomfort.
13306	0	a	One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was
13307	0	a	fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.
13308	0	a	Both of
13309	0	a	these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.
13310	0	a	I
13311	0	a	am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier
13312	0	a	Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her
13313	0	a	test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.
13314	0	a	Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.
13315	0	a	She
13316	0	a	continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking
13317	0	a	corticosteroid shots for that.
13318	0	a	On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly
13319	0	a	woman.
13320	1	a	Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.
13321	0	a	Jugular venous
13322	0	a	pulse is not observed.
13323	0	a	She has bilateral carotid bruits.
13324	0	a	Chest
13325	0	a	exam is clear.
13326	0	a	Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a
13327	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
13328	0	a	sternal border.
13329	0	a	Abdominal exam is benign.
13330	0	a	Peripheral exam shows
13331	0	a	trace pedal edema.
13332	0	a	EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute.
13333	0	a	There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old
13334	0	a	anterolateral MI.
13335	0	a	The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared
13336	0	a	with previous tracings.
13337	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085
13338	0	a	IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a
13339	0	a	Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.
13340	0	a	If she can
13341	0	a	exercise on this test, that would be even better.
13342	0	a	When the
13343	0	a	results are back, I will get back you regarding further
13344	0	a	recommendations.
13345	0	a	My hope is that we will not have to
13346	0	a	revascularize her again.
13347	0	a	If we do, I am hoping to do so with
13348	0	a	potential angioplasty and stenting.
13349	0	a	In the meantime, I have
13350	0	a	switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes
13351	0	a	of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100.
13352	0	a	Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.
13353	0	a	I also suggested to her in
13354	0	a	the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know
13355	0	a	the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of
13356	0	a	her steroid injection for her back.
13357	0	a	Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
13358	0	a	regarding this patient.
13359	0	a	Again, thank you for referring her to
13360	0	a	our clinic.

13375	0	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
13376	0	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
13377	0	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
13378	0	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
13379	0	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
13380	0	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
13381	0	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
13382	0	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
13383	0	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
13384	0	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
13385	2	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
13386	0	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
13387	0	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
13388	0	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
13389	0	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
13390	0	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
13391	0	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
13392	0	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
13393	0	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
13394	0	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
13395	0	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
13396	0	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
13397	0	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
13398	0	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
13399	0	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
13400	0	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
13401	0	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
13402	0	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
13403	0	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
13404	0	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
13405	0	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
13406	1	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
13407	0	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
13408	0	a	Chest is clear.
13409	0	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
13410	0	a	PMI is normal.
13411	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
13412	0	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
13413	0	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
13414	0	a	The abdomen is obese.
13415	0	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
13416	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
13417	0	a	Distal pulses are normal.
13418	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
13419	0	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
13420	0	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
13421	0	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
13422	0	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
13423	0	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
13424	0	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
13425	0	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
13426	0	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
13427	0	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
13428	0	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
13429	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
13430	0	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
13431	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
13432	0	a	Kindest personal regards.

14186	0	a	MRN:     8514931
14187	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian
14188	0	a	female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness.
14189	0	a	Her daughter,
14190	0	a	who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today.
14191	0	a	Apparently, for
14192	0	a	"many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled"""
14193	0	a	when she walks.
14194	0	a	This never occurs when lying down or sitting.
14195	0	a	It is only when she is
14196	0	a	walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or
14197	0	a	backward.
14198	0	a	At times, she does visibly veer when she walks.
14199	0	a	She has had one fall a
14200	0	a	number of months ago when she broke her wrist.
14201	0	a	She has not had any subsequent
14202	0	a	falls.
14203	0	a	There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,
14204	0	a	numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache.
14205	0	a	She actually
14206	0	a	feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it
14207	0	a	was a little more severe.
14208	0	a	Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.
14209	0	a	Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.
14210	0	a	Review of other systems notable for general fatigue.
14211	0	a	Otherwise unremarkable.
14212	0	a	No
14213	0	a	chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
14214	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,
14215	0	a	hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts.
14216	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,
14217	0	a	Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx.
14218	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.
14219	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece.
14220	0	a	She neither drinks nor
14221	0	a	smokes.
14222	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,
14223	0	a	72-year-old female.
14224	1	a	BP 140/84.
14225	0	a	Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,
14226	0	a	except for decreased hearing on the left.
14227	0	a	On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift.
14228	0	a	Good
14229	0	a	power throughout upper and lower extremities.
14230	0	a	She does, however, seem mildly
14231	0	a	bradykinetic diffusely.
14232	0	a	Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric.
14233	0	a	Amplitude
14234	0	a	is normal for finger tapping.
14235	0	a	Power in the lower extremities 5/5.
14236	0	a	Sensory exam with
14237	0	a	mild vibratory loss in the toes.
14238	0	a	Finger-to-nose testing intact.
14239	0	a	Foot-tapping decreased
14240	0	a	bilaterally.
14241	0	a	Romberg sway.
14242	0	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to
14243	0	a	either side.
14244	0	a	She is unable to perform tandem.
14245	0	a	DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+
14246	0	a	ankle jerks.
14247	0	a	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
14248	0	a	DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter
14249	0	a	hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral
14250	0	a	pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right
14251	0	a	internal capsule and bilateral thalami.
14252	0	a	Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the
14253	0	a	anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the
14254	0	a	posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment
14255	0	a	stenosis of the basilar artery.
14256	0	a	Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134.
14257	0	a	8/30
14258	0	a	bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits.
14259	0	a	LFT's normal except SGOT
14260	0	a	elevated at 46.
14261	0	a	IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and
14262	2	a	hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady.
14263	0	a	She is
14264	0	a	symptomatic only when she walks.
14265	0	a	Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
14266	0	a	toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the
14267	0	a	wide-based, at times veering gait.
14268	0	a	It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are
14269	0	a	multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.
14270	0	a	It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given
14271	0	a	that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she
14272	0	a	is concerned about.
14273	0	a	However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,
14274	0	a	she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she
14275	0	a	became hypotensive.
14276	0	a	As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding
14277	0	a	Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she
14278	0	a	can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine.
14279	0	a	I will see her in follow up in two
14280	0	a	months to see how she is doing.
14281	0	a	May also consider checking CBC, given her
14282	0	a	symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

14435	0	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
14436	0	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
14437	0	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
14438	0	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
14439	0	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
14440	0	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
14441	0	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
14442	0	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
14443	0	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
14444	0	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
14445	0	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
14446	0	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
14447	2	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
14448	0	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
14449	0	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
14450	0	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
14451	0	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
14452	0	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
14453	0	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
14454	0	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
14455	0	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
14456	0	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
14457	0	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
14458	0	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
14459	0	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
14460	0	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
14461	0	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
14462	0	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
14463	0	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
14464	0	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
14465	0	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
14466	0	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
14467	0	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
14468	0	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
14469	0	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
14470	0	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
14471	0	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
14472	0	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
14473	0	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
14474	0	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
14475	0	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
14476	0	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
14477	0	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
14478	0	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
14479	0	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
14480	0	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
14481	0	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
14482	0	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
14483	0	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
14484	0	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
14485	0	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
14486	0	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
14487	0	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
14488	0	a	Sincerely,
14489	0	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

15413	0	a	Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever.
15414	0	a	Assessment and plan:
15415	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.
15416	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
15417	0	a	Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.
15418	0	a	We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.
15419	0	a	If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.
15420	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

15433	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male
15434	0	a	with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
15435	2	a	history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and
15436	0	a	DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently
15437	0	a	missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal
15438	0	a	girth and shortness of breath.
15439	0	a	He said that his father has been
15440	0	a	sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time
15441	0	a	helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday
15442	0	a	and missed his Friday dialysis run.
15443	0	a	Today is Sunday and he
15444	0	a	generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.
15445	0	a	When I asked if he
15446	0	a	has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,
15447	0	a	but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and
15448	0	a	was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the
15449	0	a	pain.
15450	0	a	Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain
15451	0	a	when he was exerting himself.
15452	0	a	He does feel slightly increased
15453	0	a	shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks
15454	0	a	that because of increased fluids.
15455	0	a	He has had no fevers or
15456	0	a	chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.
15457	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

15487	0	a	nerves II through XII tested and intact.
15488	0	a	No motor or sensory
15489	0	a	deficits.
15490	0	a	Gait is normal.
15491	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which
15492	0	a	showed normal sinus rhythm.
15493	0	a	No significant ST or T
15494	0	a	abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with
15495	0	a	his previous EKG.
15496	0	a	PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of
15497	0	a	acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.
15498	0	a	Only labs which resulted
15499	0	a	initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets
15500	0	a	423,000 and white count of 6.74.
15501	0	a	We made contact with the renal
15502	0	a	fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the
15503	0	a	dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this
15504	0	a	patient.
15505	0	a	His potassium was not back at the time that he left the
15506	0	a	department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias
15507	0	a	on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is
15508	0	a	very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess
15509	0	a	when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure
15510	0	a	that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.
15511	0	a	After he
15512	0	a	left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1
15513	0	a	and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a
15514	0	a	chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,
15515	0	a	glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium
15516	0	a	8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called
15517	0	a	the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have
15518	0	a	the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to
15519	0	a	treat him there acutely.
15520	0	a	Again after the dialysis, the patient
15521	0	a	will return to the Emergency Department.
15522	0	a	We will reassess if
15523	0	a	symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes.
15524	0	a	If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no
15525	0	a	chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for
15526	0	a	acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not
15527	0	a	acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he
15528	0	a	will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis
15529	0	a	schedule.
15530	0	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.
15531	0	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.

15545	0	a	This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Elmore.
15546	0	a	Resident's
15547	0	a	note was reviewed.
15548	0	a	The patient was seen and examined by me, and
15549	0	a	I confirm the resident's findings.
15550	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a
15551	0	a	46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,

15554	0	a	dependent.
15555	0	a	Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute
15556	0	a	onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and
15557	0	a	diaphoresis while at home.
15558	0	a	Called EMS and was brought to the
15559	0	a	Emergency Department.
15560	0	a	The patient is unable to give a full
15561	0	a	history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory
15562	0	a	distress.
15563	0	a	Please review resident's note for full details of
15564	0	a	obtainable past medical history, social history, review of
15565	0	a	systems, medications, and allergies.
15566	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as
15567	0	a	documented.
15568	0	a	The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.
15569	0	a	Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted
15570	1	a	at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.
15571	0	a	Physical exam
15572	0	a	reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with
15573	0	a	accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.
15574	0	a	She has rales
15575	0	a	halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
15576	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.
15577	0	a	Abdomen is obese but soft.
15578	0	a	Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees.
15579	0	a	Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.
15580	0	a	On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual
15581	0	a	nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.
15582	0	a	She is known to make urine, a
15583	0	a	Foley catheter was placed immediately.
15584	0	a	IV access was
15585	0	a	established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics.
15586	0	a	Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.
15587	0	a	On
15588	0	a	BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.
15589	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit
15590	0	a	of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.
15591	0	a	BNP was noted at
15592	0	a	700.
15593	0	a	Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was
15594	0	a	less than assay.
15595	0	a	However, labs were obtained within half an hour
15596	0	a	of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.
15597	0	a	Urinalysis
15598	0	a	was negative and urine HCG was negative.
15599	0	a	EKG was sinus
15600	0	a	tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for
15601	0	a	rate-related ischemia.
15602	0	a	There were no prior EKGs available.
15603	0	a	Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.
15604	0	a	The Nephrology fellow covering
15605	0	a	hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate
15606	0	a	hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.
15607	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and
15608	0	a	CHF.
15609	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is
15610	0	a	likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary
15611	0	a	edema and subsequent symptomatology.
15612	0	a	Given the current regimen,
15613	0	a	in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.
15614	0	a	The
15615	0	a	respiratory rate was noted at 23.
15616	0	a	Her heart rate came down to
15617	0	a	113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV
15618	1	a	nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.

15633	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care.
15634	0	a	He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.
15635	0	a	Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.
15636	0	a	Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.
15637	0	a	Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.
15638	0	a	He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.
15639	0	a	He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.
15640	0	a	Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.
15641	0	a	He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.
15642	0	a	He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.
15643	0	a	He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.
15644	0	a	This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.
15645	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.
15646	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.
15647	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
15648	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.
15649	0	a	His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.
15650	0	a	Sinuses: Non-tender.
15651	0	a	Nasal turbinates: Benign.
15652	0	a	Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.
15653	0	a	Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.
15654	0	a	Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.
15655	0	a	I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.
15656	0	a	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.
15657	0	a	Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.
15658	0	a	Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.
15659	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.
15660	0	a	I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.
15661	0	a	He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.

16424	2	a	The constellation of myalgias, arthralgias/synovitis, ?pleurisy, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN and +FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma.
16425	0	a	Rarely, a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations (systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma).
16426	0	a	The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c/w possible crystal disease.
16427	0	a	The bilateral hand distribution is typical, but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not.
16428	0	a	Postviral arthralgias/myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process.
16429	0	a	Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia.
16430	0	a	We recommend
16431	0	a	"  	If available, past ANA, RF, ESR"
16432	0	a	"  	Please check ANA, RF, parvovirus IgM and IgG, uric acid level, U/A"

16681	0	a	RE:  Christine Olivier
16682	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
16683	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
16684	0	a	Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
16685	0	a	regarding her current cardiac condition.
16686	0	a	As her history is well
16687	0	a	known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.
16688	0	a	Mrs.
16689	0	a	Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
16690	0	a	coronary artery disease.
16691	0	a	After several catheterizations in the
16692	0	a	2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
16693	0	a	(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
16694	0	a	showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
16695	0	a	was managed medically.
16696	0	a	However, she suffered a non-Q wave
16697	0	a	myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
16698	0	a	underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
16699	0	a	artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
16700	0	a	bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
16701	0	a	her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
16702	0	a	marginal branch.
16703	0	a	She underwent repeat catheterization in February
16704	0	a	of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
16705	0	a	but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
16706	0	a	She
16707	0	a	underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
16708	0	a	a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
16709	0	a	proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
16710	0	a	with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
16711	0	a	and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
16712	0	a	The saphenous
16713	0	a	vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
16714	0	a	stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
16715	0	a	to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
16716	0	a	saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
16717	0	a	The left
16718	0	a	intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
16719	0	a	stenoses.
16720	0	a	Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
16721	0	a	posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%.
16722	0	a	She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
16723	0	a	in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
16724	0	a	to her diagonal artery.
16725	0	a	She tolerated this uneventfully and was

16727	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5                    -2-            July 05, 2074
16728	0	a	discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
16729	0	a	discomfort.
16730	0	a	Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
16731	0	a	exertional dyspnea.
16732	0	a	She has undergone extensive pulmonary
16733	0	a	evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
16734	0	a	have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
16735	0	a	1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
16736	0	a	with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.
16737	0	a	In
16738	0	a	addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
16739	2	a	hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.
16740	0	a	Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
16741	0	a	insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
16742	0	a	coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril

16744	0	a	q.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a
16745	0	a	twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,
16746	0	a	Trusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s.
16747	0	a	and albuterol
16748	0	a	inhalers two puffs q.i.d.
16749	0	a	prn.
16750	0	a	Cigarettes - none at present.
16751	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
16752	0	a	no acute distress.
16753	1	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
16754	0	a	rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
16755	0	a	pounds.
16756	0	a	The neck is supple.
16757	0	a	JVP flat.
16758	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without
16759	0	a	significant bruits.
16760	0	a	Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
16761	0	a	rhonchi.
16762	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
16763	0	a	and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
16764	0	a	the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
16765	0	a	The abdomen is
16766	0	a	benign with bowel sounds well heard.
16767	0	a	Extremities without
16768	0	a	appreciable edema.
16769	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
16770	0	a	There is 1+
16771	0	a	bipedal edema.
16772	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.
16773	0	a	PR interval
16774	0	a	of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.
16775	0	a	There is evidence of a
16776	0	a	left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
16777	0	a	through V3.
16778	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
16779	0	a	atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
16780	0	a	exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
16781	0	a	She denies any active chest
16782	0	a	discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
16783	0	a	alleviating the chest pain syndrome.
16784	0	a	The records available to me
16785	0	a	indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
16786	0	a	blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
16787	0	a	exacerbation of her angina.
16788	0	a	However, now that she is status post
16789	0	a	her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
16790	0	a	reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
16791	0	a	50 mg po q.d.
16792	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked within the
16793	0	a	next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will
16794	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5                    -3-            July 05, 2074
16795	0	a	also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
16796	0	a	edema and in part because she may no longer need this.
16797	0	a	Otherwise,
16798	0	a	I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
16799	0	a	to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
16800	0	a	can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
16801	0	a	close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur.
16802	0	a	I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
16803	0	a	appropriate.
16804	0	a	Sincerely yours,

17116	0	a	HPI: 
17117	2	a	79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI.
17118	0	a	It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday.
17119	0	a	She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV.
17120	0	a	She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress.
17121	0	a	ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection.
17122	0	a	Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.
17123	0	a	On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow.
17124	0	a	Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most.
17125	0	a	LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.
17126	0	a	A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.
17127	0	a	On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr.
17128	0	a	Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012.
17129	0	a	Her Temp.
17130	0	a	was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission.
17131	0	a	She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K.
17132	0	a	Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP.
17133	0	a	Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr.
17134	0	a	When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin.
17135	0	a	The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

17450	0	a	I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.

17452	0	a	She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.

17635	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
17636	0	a	Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.
17637	0	a	Currently, she
17638	0	a	complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
17639	0	a	discomfort.
17640	0	a	In addition, she states that she has no energy and
17641	0	a	worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.
17642	0	a	She
17643	0	a	reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
17644	0	a	discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.
17645	0	a	She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
17646	0	a	units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH

17651	0	a	mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
17652	0	a	twenty-four hour period.
17653	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress.
17654	1	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
17655	0	a	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.
17656	0	a	The neck is
17657	0	a	supple.
17658	0	a	JVP flat.
17659	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
17660	0	a	Chest is completely clear.
17661	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
17662	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
17663	0	a	radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
17664	0	a	murmur or rub.
17665	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
17666	0	a	Extremities without
17667	0	a	appreciable edema.
17668	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
17669	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
17670	0	a	PR interval
17671	0	a	of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.
17672	0	a	There are mild diffuse

17679	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
17680	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
17681	0	a	multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.
17682	0	a	Currently it is not
17683	0	a	clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
17684	0	a	however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
17685	0	a	(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.
17686	0	a	In addition, I
17687	0	a	will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
17688	0	a	hemoglobin.
17689	0	a	It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
17690	0	a	generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause.
17691	0	a	Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
17692	0	a	present regimen.
17693	0	a	She will contact you or myself should her chest
17694	0	a	pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.
17695	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

17857	0	a	He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.
17858	0	a	I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.
17859	0	a	The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.
17860	0	a	MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.
17861	0	a	The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.
17862	0	a	He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.
17863	0	a	The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.
17864	0	a	Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.

18227	2	a	HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
18228	0	a	She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.
18229	0	a	She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.
18230	0	a	She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.
18231	0	a	There is no operative report from the procedure.
18232	0	a	Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.
18233	0	a	Tissue appeared fairly healthy.
18234	0	a	She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.
18235	0	a	She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.

18295	2	a	Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
18296	0	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
18297	0	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
18298	0	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
18299	0	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
18300	0	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
18301	0	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
18302	0	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
18303	0	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
18304	0	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results
18305	0	a	Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose

18356	0	a	This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain.
18357	0	a	The first episode started this AM (10AM).
18358	0	a	It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic.
18359	0	a	Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v.
18360	0	a	Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.
18361	0	a	He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case.
18362	0	a	He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.
18363	0	a	Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain.
18364	0	a	On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain.
18365	0	a	He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker.
18366	0	a	His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3.

18485	2	a	  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency.
18486	0	a	The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant.
18487	0	a	In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out.
18488	0	a	Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it.
18489	0	a	Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.
18490	0	a	Major Problems
18491	0	a	Diabetes mellitus
18492	0	a	Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
18493	0	a	The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.
18494	0	a	Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.
18495	0	a	The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.
18496	0	a	Chronic renal insufficiency
18497	0	a	The patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.
18498	2	a	Hypertension
18499	2	a	The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension.
18500	0	a	Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS.
18501	2	a	BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.
18502	0	a	Erectile dysfunction
18503	0	a	The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.
18504	0	a	For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.
18505	0	a	Anemia
18506	0	a	The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.
18507	0	a	He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.
18508	0	a	Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.
18509	0	a	Thrombocytosis
18510	0	a	The patient is on Hydria 500 mg PO QD for this problem and he is being followed by Hematology.
18511	0	a	Hyperlipidemia
18512	0	a	The patient's hyperlipidemia is new.
18513	0	a	Most recently, his lipids were done on 02/27/2062 and at that time his total cholesterol was 294 and his LDL was 209.
18514	0	a	This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.
18515	0	a	Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.
18516	0	a	We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.

18555	0	a	History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
18556	0	a	this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
18557	0	a	diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.
18558	0	a	Also 
18559	2	a	with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
18560	0	a	hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d.
18561	0	a	for the last year, which he discontinued 
18562	0	a	last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
18563	0	a	he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
18564	0	a	he is afraid that his sugar is up.
18565	0	a	He states that over the last two or 
18566	0	a	three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
18567	0	a	followed by mild headaches.
18568	0	a	He says that the visual changes are usually 
18569	0	a	accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
18570	0	a	Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.
18571	0	a	He does admit to a history of 
18572	0	a	migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
18573	0	a	severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
18574	0	a	migraine aura.
18575	0	a	He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
18576	0	a	they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come

18587	0	a	this in the past.
18588	0	a	His past medical history is otherwise benign.
18589	0	a	Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
18590	0	a	basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
18591	0	a	pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
18592	0	a	from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
18593	0	a	frequently.
18594	0	a	He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.
18595	0	a	He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.

18620	0	a	heme positive stool.
18621	0	a	Neurologic exam was intact.
18622	0	a	Assessment and Plan:  
18623	0	a	1.
18624	0	a	Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
18625	0	a	     sugar at this time.
18626	0	a	Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
18627	0	a	     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
18628	0	a	     to 10 mg. q.d.
18629	0	a	He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
18630	0	a	     control as well.
18631	0	a	2.
18632	2	a	Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.
18633	0	a	I 
18634	0	a	     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
18635	0	a	     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
18636	0	a	     diet.
18637	0	a	3.
18638	0	a	Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.
18639	0	a	I will get a 
18640	0	a	     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
18641	0	a	     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
18642	0	a	4.
18643	0	a	Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
18644	0	a	     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
18645	0	a	     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
18646	0	a	     time.

19030	0	a	ASSESSMENT
19031	0	a	33 y.o.
19032	0	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
19033	2	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
19034	0	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
19035	2	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
19036	0	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
19037	0	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
19038	0	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
19039	0	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
19040	0	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
19041	0	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
19042	0	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
19043	0	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
19044	0	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
19045	0	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
19046	0	a	No concentrated sweets diet
19047	0	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
19048	0	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
19049	0	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
19050	0	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
19051	0	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
19052	0	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

19150	0	a	HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
19151	2	a	dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
19152	0	a	learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
19153	0	a	presenting for follow up of his DVT.
19154	0	a	The patient's current medical 
19155	0	a	problems include:
19156	0	a	1.
19157	0	a	Recent DVT.
19158	0	a	The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
19159	0	a	     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.
19160	0	a	The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
19161	0	a	     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
19162	0	a	     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
19163	0	a	     previously over the recent few weeks.
19164	0	a	The patient stated he awoke 
19165	0	a	     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
19166	0	a	     quadriceps and right calf.
19167	0	a	He later developed progressive swelling 
19168	0	a	     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
19169	0	a	     department.
19170	0	a	He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
19171	0	a	     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.
19172	0	a	He was 
19173	0	a	     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
19174	0	a	The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
19175	0	a	     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
19176	0	a	     sent off which was negative.
19177	0	a	The patient currently returns to me 
19178	0	a	     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.
19179	0	a	He states that 
19180	0	a	     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
19181	0	a	     occur during his hospital course.
19182	0	a	The patient was also angry and 
19183	0	a	     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.
19184	0	a	I 
19185	0	a	     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
19186	0	a	     his emergency department visit.
19187	0	a	I called all of the parties 
19188	0	a	     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
19189	0	a	     occurred.
19190	0	a	2.
19191	2	a	Hypertension.
19192	0	a	The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
19193	0	a	     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
19194	0	a	     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
19195	0	a	     discontinued recently.
19196	0	a	With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
19197	0	a	     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
19198	0	a	3.
19199	0	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
19200	0	a	I recently started the patient on 
19201	0	a	     insulin.
19202	0	a	He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately

19227	0	a	Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
19228	0	a	significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.
19229	0	a	Impression:
19230	0	a	1)   DVT.
19231	0	a	Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
19232	0	a	     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.
19233	0	a	     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
19234	0	a	My feeling is that the DVT 
19235	0	a	     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
19236	0	a	     therapeutic at the present time.
19237	0	a	I have arranged for the patient to 
19238	0	a	     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
19239	0	a	     check of his PT.
19240	0	a	I left instructions that I should be called 
19241	0	a	     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
19242	0	a	     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
19243	0	a	     cane to help with ambulation.
19244	0	a	2)   Adult onset diabetes.
19245	0	a	I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
19246	0	a	     next office visit.
19247	0	a	A finger stick in the office approximately three 
19248	0	a	     hours after eating is 253.
19249	0	a	I feel this is still too elevated.
19250	0	a	     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.
19251	0	a	     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
19252	0	a	     adjustments in his medications at that time.

19354	0	a	Dear Dr. Easterling: 
19355	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI.
19356	0	a	As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation.
19357	0	a	Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease.
19358	0	a	He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin.
19359	0	a	SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5.
19360	0	a	Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%.
19361	0	a	He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs.
19362	0	a	Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm.
19363	0	a	Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort.
19364	0	a	The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest.
19365	0	a	He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
19366	0	a	Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature.

19451	0	a	   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI.
19452	0	a	We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention.
19453	0	a	We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death.
19454	0	a	He understands and has agreed to proceed.
19455	0	a	We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation.
19456	0	a	He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation.
19457	0	a	We have had a long discussion in this regard.
19458	0	a	We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly.
19459	0	a	His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.
19460	0	a	Sotalol is the best option at this time.
19461	0	a	We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079.
19462	0	a	If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load.
19463	0	a	We will assess after his angiogram.
19464	0	a	We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis.
19465	0	a	We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status.

19664	0	a	PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
19665	0	a	Dr. Hayden Avery 
19666	0	a	REFERRAL SOURCE:  
19667	0	a	Above.
19668	0	a	CONSULTATION REPLY 
19669	0	a	Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.
19670	0	a	I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.
19671	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.
19672	2	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.
19673	0	a	He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.
19674	0	a	If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.
19675	0	a	This is relieved by sitting.
19676	0	a	It will happen when walking as well.
19677	0	a	This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
19678	0	a	He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.
19679	0	a	Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.
19680	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.

19685	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.
19686	0	a	BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.

19691	0	a	He has no HIV risk factors.
19692	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.
19693	0	a	He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.
19694	0	a	He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.
19695	0	a	When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.
19696	0	a	There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.
19697	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.
19698	0	a	Pulse of 60 and regular.
19699	0	a	Carotids 2+ without bruits.
19700	0	a	Mental status:  Unremarkable.
19701	0	a	Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.
19702	0	a	No evidence of retinopathy.

19704	0	a	Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
19705	0	a	Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
19706	0	a	Rapid alternating movements intact.
19707	0	a	Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
19708	0	a	Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
19709	0	a	The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.
19710	0	a	Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.
19711	0	a	Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.
19712	0	a	He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.
19713	0	a	He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.
19714	0	a	DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
19715	0	a	Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
19716	0	a	The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
19717	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  
19718	0	a	1.
19719	0	a	Neuropathy.
19720	0	a	The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
19721	0	a	He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
19722	0	a	He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.
19723	0	a	There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
19724	0	a	I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.
19725	0	a	I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
19726	0	a	He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
19727	0	a	I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
19728	0	a	Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.
19729	0	a	The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
19730	0	a	DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

19826	0	a	NAME:     Hendrickson, Ora 
19827	0	a	MRN:      7194334
19828	0	a	This patient is here for a follow-up.
19829	0	a	She was seen with a very complete evaluation 
19830	0	a	by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.
19831	0	a	She submitted a
19832	0	a	urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her
19833	0	a	urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.
19834	0	a	A fair amount retained
19835	0	a	as postvoid residual.
19836	0	a	Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with
19837	0	a	resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor
19838	0	a	and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
19839	0	a	She
19840	0	a	has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent
19841	0	a	infections.
19842	0	a	She is most concerned about having cancer.
19843	0	a	She is scheduled to see Dr.
19844	0	a	Quezada March 24th.
19845	0	a	The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
19846	0	a	been issues going around the housing projects.
19847	0	a	A 14-year-old girl was raped and
19848	0	a	one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
19849	0	a	She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
19850	0	a	She did not file a
19851	0	a	police report.
19852	0	a	As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
19853	0	a	reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix
19854	0	a	approximately one week ago.
19855	0	a	She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet
19856	0	a	sporadically but not on a regular basis.
19857	0	a	She denies any chest pressure or
19858	0	a	palpitations.
19859	0	a	She denies any shortness of breath.
19860	0	a	She denies any problems with
19861	0	a	pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.
19862	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.
19863	0	a	Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
19864	0	a	No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
19865	0	a	UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.
19866	0	a	Her
19867	0	a	ankle reveals trace edema on the left.
19868	0	a	Her right extremity is warm to palpation.
19869	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
19870	2	a	(1)  Hypertension.
19871	0	a	Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
19872	0	a	This
19873	0	a	     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.
19874	0	a	I have
19875	0	a	     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d.
19876	0	a	on a regular
19877	0	a	     basis.
19878	0	a	(2)  Anxiety.
19879	0	a	I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try
19880	0	a	     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.
19881	0	a	(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
19882	0	a	She had a urine culture submitted today.
19883	0	a	She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.
19884	0	a	     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
19885	0	a	I attempted to
19886	0	a	     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current
19887	0	a	     recurrent infections.
19888	0	a	It is more likely due to her cystocele.
19889	0	a	(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.
19890	0	a	This appears stable.
19891	0	a	She remains off the
19892	0	a	     cigarettes.
19893	0	a	(5)  ASCVD.
19894	0	a	She remains without symptoms.
19895	0	a	(6)  GERD.
19896	0	a	She remains on the Prilosec.
19897	0	a	(7)  Hyperlipidemia.
19898	0	a	She remains on Lipitor.
19899	0	a	She should have a repeat
19900	0	a	     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.
19901	0	a	(8)  Borderline high sugar.
19902	0	a	The patient should also have this rechecked with the
19903	0	a	     new physician in the fall.

20265	0	a	RE:Craft, Lloyd
20266	0	a	MRN:26649180
20267	0	a	Dear Dr. Short:
20268	0	a	Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr.
20269	0	a	Craft for the 
20270	0	a	possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
20271	0	a	As you know, he 
20272	0	a	is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
20273	0	a	history for a rheumatological disease.
20274	0	a	His past medical history, 
20275	0	a	briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
20276	0	a	time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
20277	0	a	he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
20278	0	a	characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
20279	0	a	stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.
20280	0	a	All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
20281	0	a	He was 
20282	0	a	treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
20283	0	a	that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
20284	0	a	symptoms and seizures went away.
20285	0	a	Since that time, he has had a 
20286	0	a	recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
20287	0	a	neck, pressure within his head.
20288	0	a	He considers himself to have 
20289	0	a	vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
20290	0	a	numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
20291	0	a	salivation and increased appetite.
20292	0	a	In describing his headache, he 
20293	0	a	noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
20294	0	a	has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
20295	0	a	quality.
20296	0	a	It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
20297	0	a	associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.
20298	0	a	There is no 
20299	0	a	family history of migraines as well.
20300	0	a	Also during his headache 
20301	0	a	events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
20302	0	a	nausea or vomiting.
20303	0	a	Past medical history:  As per above.
20304	0	a	Medicval issues include 
20305	0	a	bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
20306	0	a	gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
20307	0	a	migraine headaches.
20308	0	a	His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
20309	2	a	chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n.
20310	0	a	and 
20311	0	a	prednisone p.r.n.
20312	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.
20313	0	a	There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
20314	0	a	use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
20315	0	a	remission.

20318	0	a	Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes

20347	0	a	Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
20348	0	a	of lupus in the past.
20349	0	a	His recent blood work shows that his 
20350	0	a	double-stranded DNA was negative.
20351	0	a	Taking into consideration his 
20352	0	a	current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
20353	0	a	evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
20354	0	a	disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
20355	0	a	central nervous system vasculitis.
20356	0	a	He was told that he is at a 
20357	0	a	high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
20358	0	a	pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.
20359	0	a	If it is 
20360	0	a	possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
20361	0	a	a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
20362	0	a	also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d.
20363	0	a	for primary prevention 
20364	0	a	of heart disease.
20365	0	a	He was informed that it is possible that there 
20366	0	a	is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
20367	0	a	hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
20368	0	a	symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
20369	0	a	not clear.
20370	0	a	Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.

20392	0	a	       Procedure: This 73 year old male with Cervical Herniation is scheduled for a Cervical Laminectomy with Fusion on Jan. 21, 2095 by Dr. Noah Blanchard
20393	0	a	       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.
20394	0	a	He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.
20395	0	a	He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081.
20396	0	a	He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects.
20397	0	a	Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.
20398	0	a	evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally

20412	0	a	Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia.
20413	0	a	PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia.
20414	0	a	DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain.
20415	2	a	Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia.
20416	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan.
20417	0	a	PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise.
20418	0	a	Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min.
20419	0	a	Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec).
20420	0	a	1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired.
20421	0	a	Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day.
20422	0	a	Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made.
20423	1	a	STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed.
20424	0	a	Chest pain did not occur.
20425	0	a	REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.
20426	0	a	Sinus bradycardia 56/min.
20427	0	a	First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
20428	0	a	Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
20429	0	a	However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.
20430	0	a	SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size.
20431	0	a	There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
20432	0	a	The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study.
20433	0	a	Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
20434	0	a	CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.
20435	0	a	The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

20835	0	a	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.
20836	0	a	Other potential causes include osteo or DVT.
20837	0	a	At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.

20846	0	a	Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT.
20847	0	a	Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad.
20848	0	a	She apparently had a negative PPD last year.
20849	0	a	Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass
20850	0	a	Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy

20855	0	a	RA - continue Prednisone and Methotrexate 
20856	0	a	Blood cultures (in the setting of patient's infection)
20857	0	a	Monitor fever curve and other vitals signs carefully
20858	0	a	Adrenal insufficiency - given patient's long term history of steroid use, she will need stress doses if becomes more acutely ill

21778	0	a	 SOB
21779	0	a	Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.
21780	0	a	Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday.
21781	0	a	Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection.
21782	0	a	Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).

21787	0	a	-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.
21788	0	a	BNP is not very high.
21789	0	a	However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.
21790	0	a	Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
21791	0	a	-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.
21792	0	a	Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.

22192	0	a	Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week.
22193	0	a	The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain.
22194	0	a	He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder.
22195	0	a	No fevers/chills.
22196	0	a	Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

22203	0	a	Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.
22204	0	a	Medical Decision Making ED Course
22205	0	a	75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED.
22206	0	a	The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance.
22207	0	a	Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well.
22208	0	a	Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications).
22209	0	a	Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.
22210	0	a	Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

22370	0	a	His PSA is low and will continue to follow.
22371	0	a	If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out

22769	0	a	ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
22770	0	a	Impression:  
22771	0	a	Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
22772	0	a	His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
22773	0	a	His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
22774	0	a	He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
22775	0	a	Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
22776	0	a	Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.
22777	0	a	Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
22778	0	a	He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
22779	0	a	His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
22780	0	a	He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
22781	0	a	Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
22782	0	a	His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

22874	0	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
22875	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4
22876	0	a	Dear Dr.
22877	0	a	Craft:
22878	0	a	I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.
22879	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
22880	0	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
22881	0	a	The patient does relate that
22882	0	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
22883	0	a	worse several years ago.
22884	0	a	However, with the treatment of his
22885	0	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
22886	0	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
22887	0	a	Since that
22888	0	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
22889	0	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
22890	0	a	At the same
22891	0	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
22892	0	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
22893	0	a	Lasix.
22894	0	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
22895	0	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
22896	0	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
22897	0	a	At the current time,
22898	0	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
22899	0	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
22900	0	a	months ago.
22901	0	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
22902	0	a	supplemental oxygen.
22903	0	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
22904	0	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
22905	0	a	coughing.
22906	0	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
22907	0	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
22908	0	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
22909	2	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
22910	0	a	upper GI bleed.
22911	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70
22912	0	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
22913	0	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
22914	0	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
22915	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
22916	0	a	He discontinued cigarette
22917	0	a	smoking years ago.
22918	0	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
22919	0	a	His pulse was
22920	0	a	56, afebrile.
22921	0	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
22922	0	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
22923	0	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
22924	0	a	He is in no
22925	0	a	respiratory distress at rest.
22926	0	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
22927	0	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
22928	0	a	His neck had no
22929	0	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
22930	0	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
22931	0	a	left base with crackles.
22932	0	a	His right lung was clear.
22933	0	a	His heart
22934	0	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
22935	0	a	murmur.
22936	0	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
22937	0	a	His
22938	0	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
22939	0	a	Pulmonary
22940	0	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
22941	0	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
22942	0	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
22943	0	a	His current
22944	0	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
22945	0	a	December.
22946	0	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
22947	0	a	I took Mr. Joshi
22948	0	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
22949	0	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
22950	0	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
22951	0	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
22952	0	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
22953	0	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
22954	0	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
22955	0	a	Mr. Joshi had several
22956	0	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
22957	0	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
22958	0	a	I do
22959	0	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
22960	0	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
22961	0	a	I do recommend that he get
22962	0	a	daily exercise.
22963	0	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
22964	0	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
22965	0	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
22966	0	a	I have also
22967	0	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
22968	0	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
22969	0	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
22970	0	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
22971	0	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary 
22972	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70
22973	0	a	vascular disease.
22974	0	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
22975	0	a	his initial work-up.
22976	0	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
22977	0	a	patient.
22978	0	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

23341	0	a	MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  
23342	0	a	CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.
23343	2	a	IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP.
23344	0	a	His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
23345	0	a	His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke.
23346	0	a	The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification.
23347	0	a	Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis.
23348	0	a	Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely.
23349	0	a	Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported.
23350	2	a	The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP.
23351	0	a	The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.

23612	0	a	On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.
23613	0	a	Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.
23614	0	a	She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.
23615	0	a	SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.
23616	0	a	2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.
23617	0	a	"She feels ""her veins exploding""."
23618	0	a	Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.

23668	0	a	Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.
23669	0	a	Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.
23670	0	a	My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.
23671	0	a	Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.
23672	0	a	We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.
23673	0	a	Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.
23674	0	a	In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.

24021	0	a	We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.

24056	0	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
24057	0	a	was positive.
24058	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
24059	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
24060	0	a	She had 1mm 
24061	0	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
24062	0	a	disease.
24063	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
24064	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
24065	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
24066	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
24067	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
24068	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
24069	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
24070	0	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
24071	0	a	She 
24072	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
24073	0	a	for taking it.
24074	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
24075	0	a	on atenolol.
24076	1	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
24077	0	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
24078	0	a	I will continue to work 
24079	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
24080	0	a	Her other risk 
24081	2	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
24082	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
24083	0	a	Her 
24084	0	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
24085	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
24086	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
24087	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
24088	0	a	hospital.

24784	0	a	We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation.
24785	0	a	We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation.
24786	0	a	We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease.
24787	0	a	We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment.
24788	0	a	We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily.
24789	0	a	If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation.
24790	0	a	We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management.
24791	0	a	He has a CHAD2 Score of 0.
24792	0	a	We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time.

25167	0	a	positive.
25168	0	a	If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than
25169	0	a	she requires no further workup.
25170	0	a	However, if she is RNA positive
25171	0	a	than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of
25172	0	a	inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for
25173	0	a	treatment with interferon/ribavirin.
25174	0	a	She is amenable to this and

25249	0	a	"PCP:  Talbert, Nicholas	(783)508-2821"
25250	0	a	Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital
25251	0	a	CC:  chest pain
25252	0	a	HPI:
25253	2	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.
25254	2	a	In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.
25255	0	a	He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.
25256	0	a	Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.
25257	0	a	The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.
25258	0	a	On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.
25259	0	a	Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.
25260	0	a	A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
25261	1	a	Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.
25262	1	a	His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
25263	0	a	Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
25264	0	a	He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
25265	0	a	Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.
25266	0	a	These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.
25267	0	a	The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.
25268	0	a	His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
25269	0	a	He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
25270	0	a	Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.
25271	0	a	The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.
25272	0	a	Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.
25273	0	a	The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.
25274	0	a	In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.
25275	0	a	EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
25276	0	a	Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.
25277	0	a	A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.
25278	0	a	CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.
25279	0	a	Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.

25374	0	a	Assessment:
25375	2	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.
25376	0	a	The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.
25377	0	a	The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.
25378	0	a	The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.
25379	2	a	The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.
25380	0	a	In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.
25381	0	a	The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.
25382	0	a	Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.
25383	0	a	This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.
25384	0	a	EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.
25385	0	a	The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.
25386	0	a	The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.
25387	0	a	The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.
25388	0	a	Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.

25429	0	a	Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
25430	2	a	In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms.
25431	0	a	He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time.
25432	0	a	The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
25433	0	a	Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week.
25434	0	a	He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema.
25435	0	a	He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
25436	0	a	He does not know the details of the workup.
25437	0	a	Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65.
25438	0	a	He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
25439	0	a	In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro.
25440	0	a	HR was 85 and BP 135/82.
25441	0	a	He was given ASA and a BB.
25442	0	a	Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6.
25443	0	a	Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6.
25444	0	a	There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
25445	0	a	He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44).
25446	0	a	A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
25447	0	a	(the ddimer was elevated).
25448	0	a	His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
25449	0	a	On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free.
25450	0	a	Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema.
25451	0	a	ASA and BB were cont.
25452	0	a	The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
25453	0	a	However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead.
25454	0	a	This is planned for this morning.
25455	0	a	Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

25542	0	a	CC: SOB, DOE x 5 days
25543	2	a	HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.
25544	0	a	Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.
25545	0	a	He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.
25546	0	a	Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.
25547	0	a	His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.
25548	0	a	He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.
25549	0	a	The Pt sleeps on one pillow.
25550	0	a	During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.
25551	0	a	These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.
25552	0	a	Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.
25553	0	a	He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.
25554	0	a	The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.
25555	0	a	On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.
25556	0	a	On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.
25557	0	a	He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.
25558	1	a	At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.

25683	2	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
25684	0	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
25685	0	a	Although, there were no 
25686	0	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
25687	0	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
25688	0	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
25689	0	a	However, Pt 
25690	0	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
25691	0	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
25692	0	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
25693	0	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
25694	0	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
25695	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
25696	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
25697	0	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
25698	0	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
25699	0	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
25700	0	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
25701	0	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
25702	0	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
25703	0	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
25704	0	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
25705	2	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
25706	0	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.
25707	0	a	"3)	DM - Sugars elevated."
25708	0	a	Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.
25709	0	a	"4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable."
25710	0	a	Cont home medication of Lipitor.
25711	0	a	"5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet."
25712	0	a	Consider a diabetic diet as well.
25713	0	a	"6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized."

25716	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
25717	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
25718	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
25719	0	a	Briefly:
25720	2	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
25721	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
25722	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
25723	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
25724	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
25725	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
25726	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
25727	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
25728	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

25839	0	a	The abdomen was soft with mild

25846	0	a	Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
25847	0	a	Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
25848	0	a	     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
25849	0	a	     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior

25859	0	a	     perfusion defects.
25860	0	a	She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
25861	0	a	     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.
25862	0	a	CT of chest with a PE
25863	0	a	     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
25864	0	a	HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
25865	0	a	     of general surgery.
25866	0	a	The patient had expressed an interest in considering
25867	0	a	     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
25868	0	a	Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
25869	0	a	     surgery.
25870	0	a	After extensive
25871	0	a	     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
25872	0	a	     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
25873	0	a	     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
25874	0	a	     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
25875	0	a	     to pursue this.
25876	0	a	Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
25877	0	a	Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.
25878	0	a	She will
25879	2	a	     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.
25880	0	a	Her chest wall pain is
25881	0	a	     likely due to esophageal spasm.
25882	0	a	Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
25883	0	a	Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
25884	0	a	     fibromyalgia.
25885	0	a	This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
25886	0	a	     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications.
25887	0	a	At the time, we
25888	0	a	     will continue pain medications for her comfort.
25889	0	a	Continue aggressive bowel
25890	0	a	     regimen.
25891	0	a	Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
25892	0	a	     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.
25893	0	a	The family currently
25894	0	a	     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
25895	0	a	Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
25896	0	a	     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
25897	0	a	     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.

26178	0	a	HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.
26179	2	a	He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking.
26180	0	a	He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
26181	0	a	He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
26182	0	a	He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
26183	0	a	He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.
26184	0	a	He has not had any rest pain.
26185	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
26186	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
26187	0	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
26188	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
26189	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
26190	0	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
26191	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
26192	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
26193	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
26194	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
26195	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
26196	0	a	Chest was clear.
26197	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
26198	0	a	No S3 or S4.
26199	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
26200	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
26201	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
26202	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
26203	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
26204	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
26205	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
26206	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
26207	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

26221	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
26222	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.
26223	0	a	She continues to
26224	0	a	complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
26225	0	a	secondary to exertion.
26226	0	a	These episodes occur on a roughly once a
26227	0	a	month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes.
26228	0	a	Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
26229	0	a	effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
26230	0	a	not take Nitroglycerin for it.
26231	0	a	A stress test performed last
26232	0	a	January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
26233	0	a	of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
26234	1	a	blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.
26235	0	a	She had no ischemic
26236	0	a	EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
26237	0	a	scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
26238	0	a	surrounding area of transient ischemia.
26239	0	a	In addition, there was a
26240	0	a	moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
26241	0	a	infarct mild ischemia.
26242	0	a	Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
26243	0	a	with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192.

26281	0	a	I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
26282	0	a	q h.s.
26283	0	a	for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
26284	0	a	more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
26285	0	a	aerobic activity level.
26286	0	a	In addition, I have asked her to obtain
26287	0	a	her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
26288	0	a	ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
26289	1	a	140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
26290	0	a	antihypertensive therapy.
26291	0	a	In addition, as long as she remains

26313	0	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
26314	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
26315	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
26316	0	a	follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.
26317	0	a	At her last visit her
26318	2	a	heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.
26319	0	a	We increased both her Losartan and
26320	0	a	her Toprol dosing.
26321	0	a	Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.
26322	0	a	She has generally been
26323	0	a	feeling well.
26324	0	a	She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping.
26325	0	a	She denies orthopnea or PND.
26326	0	a	She has had stable ankle edema.
26327	0	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
26328	0	a	PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
26329	0	a	day, Avandia, and multivitamins.
26330	0	a	On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.
26331	0	a	Her heart rate is in the high 60s.
26332	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the examination table.
26333	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8.
26334	0	a	Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.
26335	0	a	Cardiac examination reveals a
26336	0	a	non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.
26337	0	a	She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
26338	0	a	at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
26339	0	a	border.
26340	0	a	She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.
26341	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.
26342	0	a	There are
26343	0	a	nonspecific ST abnormalities.
26344	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.
26345	0	a	She
26346	0	a	has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.
26347	0	a	We elected
26348	0	a	to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
26349	0	a	PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

26361	0	a	Neurology Clinic Follow-up
26362	0	a	ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections
26363	0	a	HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.
26364	0	a	Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.
26365	0	a	The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.
26366	0	a	Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.
26367	0	a	Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.
26368	0	a	He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.
26369	0	a	Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.
26370	0	a	His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.
26371	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
26372	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
26373	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
26374	0	a	The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.
26375	0	a	The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.
26376	0	a	He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
26377	0	a	His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.
26378	0	a	Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.
26379	0	a	The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.
26380	0	a	This may represent abscess.
26381	0	a	Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.
26382	0	a	Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.
26383	0	a	Patient denies fever or chills.
26384	0	a	He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.
26385	0	a	This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.
26386	0	a	Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.
26387	0	a	He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.
26388	0	a	His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.
26389	0	a	He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.
26390	0	a	His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.
26391	0	a	While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.
26392	0	a	He cries when he tells me about this.
26393	0	a	A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.
26394	0	a	He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.
26395	0	a	His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.
26396	0	a	There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.
26397	0	a	He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.
26398	0	a	An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.
26399	0	a	He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.
26400	0	a	Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.
26401	0	a	They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses.

26682	0	a	Re:  Christine Olivier
26683	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
26684	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
26685	0	a	Mrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.
26686	0	a	Since last seen, she reports
26687	0	a	return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,
26688	0	a	occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.
26689	0	a	Of note, she underwent
26690	0	a	a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar
26691	0	a	syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left
26692	0	a	back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at
26693	1	a	a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60.
26694	0	a	A
26695	0	a	simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left
26696	0	a	ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction
26697	0	a	involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal
26698	0	a	peri-infarct ischemia.
26699	0	a	In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound
26700	0	a	study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right
26701	0	a	peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.
26702	0	a	Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,
26703	0	a	atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,
26704	0	a	Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40
26705	0	a	mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and
26706	0	a	Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and
26707	0	a	74 units NPH qpm.
26708	0	a	Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.
26709	0	a	Blood
26710	0	a	pressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,
26711	0	a	respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four
26712	0	a	pounds below her weight of six months ago.
26713	0	a	The neck is supple with
26714	0	a	JVP flat.
26715	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
26716	0	a	Chest is
26717	0	a	clear.
26718	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and
26719	0	a	a I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.
26720	0	a	No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
26721	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
26722	0	a	Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema.
26723	0	a	Peripheral pulses are diminished.
26724	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval
26725	0	a	of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25.
26726	0	a	There is borderline
26727	0	a	Page Two
26728	0	a	evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
26729	0	a	wave changes.
26730	0	a	Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has
26731	0	a	been no significant change.
26732	0	a	Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left
26733	0	a	shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
26734	0	a	surgery angina.
26735	0	a	In this setting, a dobutamine stress test
26736	0	a	performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.
26737	0	a	I
26738	0	a	have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
26739	0	a	therapeutic and diagnostic options.
26740	0	a	She made it quite clear that
26741	0	a	she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,
26742	0	a	and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility
26743	0	a	(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
26744	0	a	vascularization.
26745	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me that her left
26746	0	a	shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly
26747	0	a	understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities.
26748	0	a	I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.
26749	0	a	In the
26750	0	a	meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort
26751	0	a	syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
26752	0	a	bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
26753	0	a	morning.
26754	0	a	She will call me within the next several days to report
26755	0	a	how this helps her discomfort syndrome.
26756	0	a	I do not believe that she
26757	0	a	is having GERD to explain her symptoms.
26758	0	a	In light of her reluctance
26759	0	a	to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to
26760	0	a	tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
26761	0	a	discomfort syndrome.
26762	0	a	I, of course, will keep you fully informed as
26763	0	a	to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her
26764	0	a	care.
26765	0	a	Sincerely yours,

27191	0	a	Re:  Dalila Haynes
27192	0	a	       783-61-34-3
27193	0	a	Dear Dr. Kay: 
27194	0	a	I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
27195	0	a	She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
27196	0	a	I will review her history for the record.
27197	0	a	She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.
27198	0	a	Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
27199	0	a	Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.
27200	0	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
27201	0	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
27202	0	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
27203	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
27204	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
27205	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
27206	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
27207	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
27208	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
27209	0	a	Cultures were negative.
27210	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
27211	0	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
27212	0	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
27213	0	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
27214	0	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
27215	0	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
27216	0	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
27217	0	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
27218	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
27219	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
27220	0	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
27221	0	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
27222	0	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
27223	0	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
27224	0	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
27225	2	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
27226	0	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
27227	0	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
27228	0	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
27229	0	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
27230	0	a	There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
27231	0	a	She is a widow.
27232	0	a	She has four children.
27233	0	a	She used to work for Lowe's.
27234	0	a	She now lives with a daughter.
27235	0	a	She has had no recent fever or chills.
27236	0	a	Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
27237	0	a	There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
27238	0	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
27239	0	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
27240	0	a	Pulse 126, regular.
27241	0	a	BP 126/66.
27242	0	a	She is obese.
27243	0	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
27244	0	a	There are no cranial bruits.
27245	0	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
27246	0	a	There are wheezes bilaterally.
27247	0	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
27248	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
27249	0	a	The extremities are normal.
27250	0	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
27251	0	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
27252	0	a	She is oriented to place.
27253	0	a	She is inattentive.
27254	0	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
27255	0	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
27256	0	a	There is no aphasia.
27257	0	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
27258	0	a	The visual fields are full.
27259	0	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
27260	0	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
27261	0	a	.
27262	0	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
27263	0	a	Facial sensation is intact.
27264	0	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
27265	0	a	Hearing is grossly intact.
27266	0	a	Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
27267	0	a	The palate elevates normal.
27268	0	a	Gag is present.
27269	0	a	The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
27270	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
27271	0	a	Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.
27272	0	a	There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.
27273	0	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
27274	0	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
27275	0	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
27276	0	a	Coordination is intact.
27277	0	a	Romberg is negative.
27278	0	a	Gait and station are normal.
27279	0	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
27280	0	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
27281	0	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
27282	0	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
27283	0	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
27284	0	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
27285	0	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
27286	0	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
27287	0	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
27288	0	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
27289	0	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
27290	0	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
27291	0	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
27292	0	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
27293	0	a	Thank you for this consultation.
27294	0	a	Sincerely,

27505	0	a	Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD
27506	0	a	Date of visit:  March 27, 2062
27507	0	a	Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.
27508	0	a	Hematologic History:
27509	0	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.
27510	0	a	At the time, blood sugar was >500.
27511	1	a	Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.
27512	2	a	The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
27513	0	a	At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA.
27514	0	a	Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
27515	0	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
27516	0	a	He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.
27517	0	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
27518	0	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
27519	0	a	Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.
27520	0	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
27521	2	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
27522	0	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
27523	0	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
27524	0	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
27525	0	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
27526	0	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).
27527	0	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
27528	0	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
27529	0	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.
27530	0	a	His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
27531	0	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
27532	0	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
27533	0	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
27534	0	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
27535	0	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
27536	0	a	He was discharged from the hospital in September.
27537	0	a	Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.
27538	0	a	Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.
27539	0	a	His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%).
27540	0	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.
27541	0	a	His platelets were 502,000.
27542	0	a	An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.
27543	0	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.
27544	0	a	His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid.
27545	0	a	Interval History:
27546	0	a	Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.
27547	0	a	When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.
27548	0	a	A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.
27549	0	a	He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.
27550	0	a	In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.
27551	0	a	He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.
27552	0	a	He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.
27553	0	a	He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.
27554	0	a	He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.

27608	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
27609	2	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency, subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and several small embolic-appearing strokes.
27610	0	a	In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
27611	0	a	He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.
27612	0	a	It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
27613	0	a	We are following his CBC on hydrea.
27614	0	a	His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).
27615	0	a	He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.
27616	0	a	His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.
27617	0	a	We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.
27618	0	a	At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.
27619	0	a	We would advise continuing current hydrea.
27620	0	a	Continue current hydrea
27621	0	a	Monitor counts monthly
27622	0	a	Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine.
27623	0	a	Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts
27624	0	a	The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.

28068	0	a	RE:  Urania Yerger
28069	0	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
28070	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
28071	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first
28072	0	a	time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her
28073	0	a	coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in
28074	0	a	October of this year.
28075	0	a	Though you know her history well, I will
28076	0	a	recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
28077	0	a	Ms. Yerger is
28078	0	a	presently 81 years old.
28079	0	a	Her vascular risk factors include
28080	2	a	diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.
28081	0	a	She had no prior diagnosis
28082	0	a	of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash
28083	0	a	pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST
28084	0	a	elevation myocardial infarction.
28085	0	a	Coronary angiography at the
28086	0	a	Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,
28087	0	a	thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent
28088	0	a	complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal
28089	0	a	as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
28090	0	a	Angiography also
28091	0	a	revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.
28092	0	a	The patient underwent
28093	0	a	subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed
28094	0	a	by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
28095	0	a	(SVG to
28096	0	a	ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).
28097	0	a	Ms. Yerger's postoperative
28098	0	a	course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient
28099	0	a	episode of atrial fibrillation.
28100	0	a	Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of
28101	0	a	activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending
28102	0	a	shopping trips.
28103	0	a	Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve.
28104	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.
28105	0	a	She has
28106	0	a	had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein
28107	0	a	graft harvesting.
28108	0	a	She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA
28109	0	a	symptoms or claudication.
28110	0	a	Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
28111	0	a	Ms.
28112	0	a	Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on
28113	0	a	her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a
28114	0	a	possible viral exanthem.
28115	0	a	Yerger, Urania
28116	0	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078
28117	0	a	Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency
28118	0	a	(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and
28119	0	a	prior right knee replacement.
28120	0	a	Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.
28121	0	a	day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril
28122	0	a	5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.
28123	0	a	day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.
28124	0	a	Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family
28125	0	a	members in the area.
28126	0	a	She is currently staying with her daughter.
28127	0	a	At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but
28128	0	a	is limited by chronic knee pain.
28129	0	a	She denies alcohol or tobacco
28130	0	a	use.
28131	0	a	Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.
28132	0	a	On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.
28133	0	a	She is
28134	0	a	comfortable seated on the exam table.
28135	0	a	Her skin is warm and dry.
28136	0	a	She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly
28137	0	a	on her extremities.
28138	1	a	Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate
28139	0	a	is in the 70's.
28140	0	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
28141	0	a	Her
28142	0	a	carotids are 2+ without bruits.
28143	0	a	Her chest reveals decreased breath
28144	0	a	sounds at the left base.
28145	0	a	There are no crackles or wheezes.
28146	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and
28147	0	a	rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased.
28148	0	a	There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the
28149	0	a	apex.
28150	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
28151	0	a	Her extremities are free
28152	0	a	of cyanosis or clubbing.
28153	0	a	Distal pulses are 1+.
28154	0	a	She has mild edema
28155	0	a	of the left lower extremity.
28156	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and
28157	0	a	intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
28158	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after
28159	0	a	her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
28160	0	a	October.
28161	0	a	Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
28162	0	a	persistent pleural effusion.
28163	0	a	We will reevaluate today with a
28164	0	a	repeat chest x-ray.
28165	0	a	In the meantime, I think that we should
28166	0	a	continue her oral diuretic regimen.
28167	0	a	It is possible that her
28168	0	a	persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
28169	0	a	Although not certain to
28170	0	a	be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today
28171	0	a	in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
28172	0	a	resolve.
28173	0	a	I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
28174	0	a	We
28175	0	a	will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for
28176	0	a	secondary prevention.
28177	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in
28178	0	a	approximately eight to twelve weeks.
28179	0	a	In addition, she will follow-
28180	0	a	up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
28181	0	a	persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
28182	0	a	symptoms.
28183	0	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078
28184	0	a	It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.

28388	0	a	CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
28389	0	a	Dear Vicente, 
28390	0	a	Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.
28391	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year.
28392	0	a	He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
28393	0	a	In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.
28394	0	a	He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
28395	0	a	"He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep."
28396	0	a	"He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties."
28397	0	a	He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
28398	0	a	Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas.
28399	0	a	In addition, loud snoring was noted.
28400	0	a	There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes.
28401	0	a	"There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep."
28402	0	a	"There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study."
28403	0	a	In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
28404	0	a	The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm.
28405	0	a	Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes).
28406	0	a	"There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep""."
28407	0	a	"Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows""."
28408	0	a	The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general.
28409	0	a	As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.
28410	0	a	Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology).
28411	0	a	"The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day""."
28412	0	a	If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.
28413	0	a	The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.

28437	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage.
28438	0	a	He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years.
28439	0	a	His current weight is 195 pounds.
28440	0	a	He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.
28441	1	a	On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.
28442	0	a	HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.
28443	0	a	The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact.
28444	0	a	He is presently wearing dental braces.
28445	0	a	No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
28446	0	a	No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted.
28447	0	a	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
28448	0	a	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
28449	0	a	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
28450	0	a	"No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted."
28451	0	a	IMPRESSION:  
28452	0	a	"Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep."
28453	0	a	These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).
28454	0	a	Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea.
28455	0	a	The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm).
28456	0	a	"In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success."
28457	0	a	"One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above."
28458	0	a	Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem.
28459	0	a	While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e.
28460	0	a	in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
28461	0	a	PLAN:  
28462	0	a	In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.
28463	0	a	q. h.s.
28464	0	a	PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
28465	0	a	The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.
28466	0	a	The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.
28467	0	a	Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms).
28468	0	a	If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.
28469	0	a	In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.
28470	0	a	The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).
28471	0	a	Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez.
28472	0	a	I hope this letter finds you well.
28473	0	a	Sincerely yours,

30002	0	a	Dear Dr. Umali:
30003	0	a	Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.
30004	0	a	Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.
30005	0	a	He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.
30006	0	a	He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.
30007	0	a	Review of systems is negative except as above.
30008	0	a	Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.
30009	0	a	Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.
30010	0	a	Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.
30011	0	a	Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.
30012	1	a	BP 169/83 and pulse 58.
30013	0	a	Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.
30014	0	a	Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
30015	0	a	Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
30016	0	a	Extremities:  No edema, warm.
30017	0	a	Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.
30018	0	a	Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.
30019	0	a	Skeletal films are pending.
30020	0	a	Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD.
30021	0	a	Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..
30022	0	a	He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.
30023	0	a	I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.
30024	0	a	I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.
30025	0	a	However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.
30026	0	a	In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.
30027	0	a	He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.
30028	0	a	Thank you for referring this patient.
30029	0	a	Sincerely,

30047	0	a	To Dr. Estep:
30048	0	a	I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.
30049	0	a	Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
30050	0	a	Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.
30051	0	a	We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
30052	0	a	In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
30053	0	a	She recalls having only V2 clinical events.
30054	0	a	She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.
30055	0	a	She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
30056	0	a	This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
30057	0	a	There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.
30058	0	a	She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.
30059	0	a	She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.
30060	0	a	She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.
30061	0	a	She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
30062	0	a	Moreover, she does not have claudication.
30063	0	a	Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.
30064	0	a	She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

30103	0	a	Fosamax 70 mg every week.
30104	0	a	BLANK 1 tab daily.
30105	0	a	Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.
30106	0	a	Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.
30107	0	a	She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.
30108	0	a	Social History:  This woman is single.
30109	0	a	She is a retired Secretary.
30110	0	a	She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.
30111	0	a	She has no other history of substance abuse.
30112	0	a	Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.
30113	0	a	She has no other new symptoms.
30114	0	a	There is no recent GI bleeding.
30115	0	a	She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.
30116	0	a	On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.
30117	0	a	Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.
30118	0	a	Head and neck exam is unremarkable.
30119	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
30120	0	a	She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
30121	0	a	Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
30122	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
30123	0	a	Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
30124	0	a	Her apex beat is within normal limits.
30125	0	a	Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
30126	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
30127	0	a	There are no obvious masses.
30128	0	a	Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
30129	0	a	Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.
30130	0	a	They are symmetrical.
30131	0	a	Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.
30132	0	a	A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
30133	0	a	Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
30134	0	a	We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
30135	0	a	(It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).
30136	0	a	Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.
30137	0	a	If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.
30138	0	a	Her hypertension is controlled today.
30139	0	a	Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
30140	0	a	However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o.
30141	0	a	We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.
30142	0	a	It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
30143	0	a	She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
30144	0	a	We recommend.
30145	0	a	We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
30146	0	a	We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
30147	0	a	daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
30148	0	a	We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
30149	0	a	We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.
30150	0	a	We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

30578	0	a	Impression:
30579	0	a	Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history.
30580	0	a	Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure.
30581	0	a	Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital.
30582	0	a	Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history.
30583	0	a	This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.
30584	0	a	Recommendations:
30585	0	a	-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100
30586	0	a	-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively
30587	0	a	-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID
30588	0	a	-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery.
30589	0	a	Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive
30590	0	a	Thank you for this interesting consult.
30591	0	a	To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

30979	0	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
30980	0	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
30981	0	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
30982	0	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.
30983	0	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
30984	0	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
30985	0	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
30986	0	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
30987	0	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.

31043	2	a	Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
31044	0	a	He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
31045	0	a	Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.
31046	0	a	It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
31047	0	a	At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.
31048	0	a	If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.
31049	0	a	At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.
31050	0	a	If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.
31051	0	a	Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.
31052	0	a	In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

31478	2	a	HPI: 65 y/o man with PMH of stage IV CKD, HTN, CAD, RAS, DM, who was admitted to the CCU on 1/26 after an episode of bradycardia and PEA arrest at home.
31479	0	a	Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB.
31480	0	a	She called EMS.
31481	0	a	Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s.
31482	0	a	He was intubated.
31483	0	a	He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse.
31484	0	a	In the ED, his BP was 230/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt.
31485	0	a	He was noted to have blood in his OG tube.
31486	0	a	CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
31487	0	a	Chest CT showed multiple rib fractures with substernal hematoma and bilateral modest pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis vs consolidations.
31488	0	a	On admission, pt&#8217;s BUN and creatinine were 43 and 4.35, respectively.
31489	0	a	He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis without a good response.
31490	0	a	His Cr started to rise: 4.6 &#224; 4.9 &#224; 5.4 &#224; 5.33 &#224; 6.3 &#224; 7.0.

32043	0	a	A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.
32044	0	a	She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.
32045	0	a	This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.
32046	0	a	Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.
32047	0	a	In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.
32048	0	a	Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
32049	0	a	Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.
32050	0	a	Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.
32051	0	a	Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.
32052	0	a	Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.
32053	0	a	Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.
32054	0	a	However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.
32055	0	a	She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
32056	0	a	She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.
32057	0	a	Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.
32058	0	a	Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.
32059	0	a	However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.
32060	0	a	The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.
32061	0	a	Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.
32062	0	a	There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
32063	0	a	There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state
32064	0	a	Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.
32065	0	a	She had a recent stress test that was negative.
32066	0	a	However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.
32067	0	a	However, this would not cause the delirium.
32068	0	a	Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.
32069	0	a	Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.
32070	0	a	Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.
32071	0	a	Plan:
32072	0	a	Delirium:  
32073	0	a	500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1/2NS at 80cc/hr.

32102	0	a	In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium.

32172	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
32173	0	a	up.
32174	0	a	She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
32175	0	a	sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
32176	0	a	gets some pressure in her chest.
32177	0	a	She gets a slight shortness of 
32178	0	a	breath.
32179	0	a	It lasts 30 seconds.
32180	0	a	She gets as many as three or four 
32181	0	a	a day.
32182	0	a	The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
32183	0	a	better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.
32184	0	a	I think 
32185	0	a	weight loss is going to be critical.
32186	0	a	She also is less fatigued 
32187	0	a	as she begins to lose weight.
32188	2	a	Her hypertension has been under better control.
32189	0	a	Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
32190	0	a	to the atenolol.
32191	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.
32192	0	a	Weight has gone 
32193	0	a	from 200 to 196 pounds.
32194	0	a	Respiratory rate is 20.
32195	0	a	Pulse is 64.
32196	0	a	Neck is supple.
32197	0	a	There is no lymphadenopathy.
32198	0	a	Chest is clear to 
32199	0	a	percussion and auscultation.
32200	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
32201	0	a	with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
32202	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
32203	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
32204	0	a	Extremities are clear of 
32205	0	a	cyanosis, clubbing and edema.
32206	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.
32207	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
32208	0	a	1.
32209	0	a	Hypertension.
32210	0	a	Relatively well controlled on 
32211	0	a	hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
32212	0	a	2.
32213	0	a	Weight.
32214	0	a	Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
32215	0	a	better as a result of it.
32216	0	a	3.
32217	0	a	Peculiar chest pressure.
32218	0	a	I do not think she has coronary 
32219	0	a	artery disease given the exercise test.
32220	0	a	In light of this, 
32221	0	a	we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
32222	0	a	lose some weight.
32223	0	a	Hopefully, this will help with the 
32224	0	a	resolution of her symptoms.

32605	0	a	     MR #892-76-95-4
32606	0	a	Dear Usha:
32607	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
32608	0	a	Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
32609	2	a	hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
32610	0	a	As
32611	0	a	you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night.
32612	0	a	She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
32613	0	a	whenever she takes the quinine.
32614	0	a	She has not been taking this since
32615	0	a	the initial two doses.
32616	0	a	I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
32617	0	a	secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.
32618	0	a	I have told her to eat
32619	0	a	a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
32620	0	a	cramps in the evening.
32621	0	a	In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
32622	0	a	bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.
32623	0	a	There is borderline first
32624	0	a	degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
32625	0	a	from previous tracing.
32626	0	a	We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
32627	0	a	as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.
32628	0	a	She will see me in follow-up in
32629	0	a	three months' time.
32630	0	a	Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
32631	0	a	clinic.
32632	0	a	With warm regards.
32633	0	a	Sincerely,

33048	2	a	                88 yo female with a PMH of DM, HTN, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.
33049	0	a	ISSUE #1: Fever and tremors.
33050	0	a	Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.
33051	0	a	A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.
33052	0	a	An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.
33053	0	a	In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.
33054	0	a	Continue to follow lytes, CK, CBC
33055	0	a	Small doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety
33056	0	a	AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)

33231	0	a	Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis
33232	0	a	HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22.
33233	0	a	Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080.
33234	0	a	Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes.
33235	0	a	Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.
33236	0	a	After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid.
33237	0	a	HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081.
33238	0	a	On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting.
33239	0	a	Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her.
33240	0	a	Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID.
33241	0	a	Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease.
33242	0	a	Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial.
33243	0	a	She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
33244	0	a	She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management.
33245	0	a	On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID.
33246	0	a	Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse.
33247	0	a	Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse.
33248	0	a	Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.
33249	0	a	Written only for insulin sliding scale.

33335	0	a	Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition.
33336	0	a	Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20.
33337	0	a	Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.
33338	0	a	Abdominal pain can be multifactorial.
33339	0	a	I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease.
33340	0	a	With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility.
33341	0	a	Recommendations: 
33342	0	a	"1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility."
33343	0	a	a.
33344	0	a	Would not hold long acting insulin.
33345	0	a	Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO
33346	0	a	b.
33347	0	a	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started.
33348	0	a	If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.
33349	0	a	"c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:"
33350	0	a	"i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units."
33351	0	a	"d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner."
33352	0	a	Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
33353	0	a	She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
33354	0	a	"e.	No metformin for now given GI upset."
33355	0	a	"2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace."
33356	0	a	"3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac."
33357	0	a	Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina.
33358	0	a	Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
33359	0	a	I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.
33360	0	a	"4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response."
33361	0	a	Thank you for the consult.

33774	0	a	Dear Dr. Stafford:
33775	0	a	     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
33776	0	a	Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
33777	0	a	as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
33778	0	a	In summary, she is
33779	0	a	a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
33780	0	a	since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.
33781	0	a	By
33782	0	a	report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
33783	0	a	peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.
33784	0	a	In viewing
33785	0	a	her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.
33786	0	a	Her
33787	0	a	three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
33788	0	a	She does,
33789	0	a	however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
33790	0	a	on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
33791	0	a	These episodes are
33792	0	a	relieved by nitroglycerin.
33793	0	a	Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
33794	0	a	walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
33795	0	a	by slowing down.
33796	2	a	In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
33797	0	a	only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.
33798	0	a	cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.
33799	0	a	I don't have
33800	0	a	fractionations and her family history is unknown.
33801	0	a	A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
33802	0	a	ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
33803	0	a	preserved LV size and function.
33804	0	a	She had an exercise tolerance test
33805	0	a	in February of 2085.
33806	0	a	On a modified protocol, she went for less
33807	0	a	than 4 1/2 minutes.
33808	0	a	This is equivalent to not even completing
33809	0	a	stage 1 of the standard Bruce.
33810	0	a	With that, she did develop chest
33811	0	a	pain and had 2 mm of ST depression.
33812	0	a	That study was accompanied by
33813	0	a	both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
33814	0	a	consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
33815	0	a	ischemia.
33816	0	a	As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
33817	0	a	portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
33818	0	a	to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
33819	0	a	That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
33820	0	a	only have the report.
33821	0	a	However, from this report, there was
33822	0	a	preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
33823	0	a	MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
33824	0	a	Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
33825	0	a	proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
33826	0	a	LAD.
33827	0	a	The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
33828	0	a	discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
33829	0	a	The
33830	0	a	right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
33831	0	a	stenosis.
33832	0	a	At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
33833	0	a	therapy.
33834	0	a	Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
33835	0	a	prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
33836	0	a	other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
33837	0	a	daily insulin therapy.
33838	0	a	In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
33839	0	a	have involved the hemodialysis access.
33840	0	a	She has had one pregnancy
33841	0	a	28 years ago without complications.
33842	0	a	I also elicited a history of
33843	0	a	some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
33844	0	a	This
33845	0	a	was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
33846	1	a	On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
33847	0	a	regular, her weight 95 lbs.
33848	0	a	Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
33849	0	a	arm.
33850	0	a	There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
33851	0	a	distended.
33852	0	a	Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained.
33853	0	a	There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
33854	0	a	apex.
33855	0	a	Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
33856	0	a	were without edema.
33857	0	a	The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
33858	0	a	diffuse STT changes.
33859	0	a	There were no pathologic Q waves.
33860	0	a	Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
33861	0	a	transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
33862	0	a	status.
33863	0	a	She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
33864	0	a	shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
33865	0	a	limited functional capacity.
33866	0	a	The coronary angiography reveals a
33867	0	a	presence of multi-vessel disease.
33868	0	a	Even without seeing the primary
33869	0	a	data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
33870	0	a	she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.
33871	0	a	Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
33872	0	a	bypass surgery.
33873	0	a	Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
33874	0	a	with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.
33875	0	a	I
33876	0	a	would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
33877	0	a	10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.
33878	0	a	As
33879	0	a	indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
33880	0	a	suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
33881	0	a	symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
33882	0	a	pressing.
33883	0	a	I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
33884	0	a	her care.
33885	0	a	Sincerely,

34550	0	a	Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085.
34551	0	a	Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.
34552	0	a	In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.
34553	0	a	She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.
34554	2	a	She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.
34555	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.
34556	0	a	Triamterene was added.
34557	0	a	Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.
34558	0	a	Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.
34559	0	a	She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.
34560	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.
34561	0	a	She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.
34562	0	a	Yamilex is generally doing well.
34563	0	a	She has no particular complaints.
34564	0	a	She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.
34565	0	a	She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.
34566	0	a	Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d.
34567	0	a	for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.
34568	1	a	Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.
34569	0	a	Heart rate was 82 and regular.
34570	0	a	The HEENT examination was unremarkable.
34571	0	a	Neck was supple without adenopathy.
34572	0	a	There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.
34573	0	a	Chest was clear to auscultation.
34574	0	a	Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.
34575	0	a	Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.
34576	0	a	Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.
34577	0	a	Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.
34578	0	a	Assessment and plan: 
34579	0	a	1.
34580	2	a	Hypertension.
34581	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.
34582	2	a	She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.
34583	0	a	I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.
34584	0	a	2.
34585	0	a	Neurologic.
34586	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.
34587	0	a	She will continue on Coumadin.
34588	0	a	I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.
34589	0	a	3.
34590	0	a	Primary care issues.
34591	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.
34592	0	a	I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.
34593	0	a	I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.
34594	0	a	I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.
34595	0	a	I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.

34664	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
34665	0	a	Edema.
34666	0	a	The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.
34667	0	a	She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.
34668	0	a	I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.
34669	0	a	She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.
34670	0	a	Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.
34671	0	a	I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.
34672	0	a	Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.
34673	0	a	The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.
34674	0	a	I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
34675	0	a	I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.
34676	0	a	I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.
34677	0	a	Low back pain.
34678	0	a	I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.
34679	0	a	We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.
34680	0	a	We elected against using these medications today.
34681	0	a	History of sleep apnea.
34682	0	a	The patient has significant fatigue.
34683	0	a	This may be due to her sleep apnea.
34684	0	a	In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.
34685	0	a	I discussed this with her today.
34686	0	a	I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.
34687	0	a	She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.
34688	0	a	She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

35290	0	a	Dear Dr. Knapp:
35291	0	a	It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.
35292	0	a	He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.
35293	0	a	In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.
35294	0	a	He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.
35295	2	a	His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.
35296	0	a	During his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm.
35297	0	a	His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure.
35298	0	a	After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35.
35299	0	a	He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil.
35300	0	a	The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.
35301	0	a	There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.
35302	0	a	His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.
35303	0	a	The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.
35304	0	a	He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.
35305	0	a	At the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.
35306	0	a	His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
35307	0	a	b.i.d.
35308	0	a	He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.
35309	0	a	His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation.
35310	0	a	He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.
35311	0	a	His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm.
35312	0	a	His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.
35313	0	a	It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.
35314	0	a	He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family.
35315	0	a	We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.
35316	0	a	He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care.
35317	0	a	I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.
35318	0	a	Sincerely,

35334	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.
35335	0	a	I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.
35336	0	a	So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.
35337	0	a	We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.
35338	0	a	These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.
35339	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.
35340	0	a	He had no other complaints.
35341	0	a	His bowel movements are regular.
35342	0	a	He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.
35343	0	a	He otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.
35344	0	a	His social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded.
35345	0	a	There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.
35346	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 140/60.
35347	0	a	He looks well.

35351	0	a	Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal.
35352	0	a	Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.
35353	0	a	Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs.
35354	0	a	Liver and spleen were not palpable.
35355	0	a	He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.
35356	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper.
35357	0	a	He will come back to see me in about a month's time to follow up on these issues.
35358	0	a	CAD is stable with pacemaker
35359	0	a	HGB A1c is 7.0, Hct is down to 31.6, epo 37, creatinine stable at 1.6, MCV 93.3.
35360	0	a	Most likely anemia of chronic illness but need to check smear and stools

35928	0	a	Dear Dr. Nunes:
35929	0	a	Thank you for asking me to see Mr.
35930	0	a	Craft.
35931	0	a	Patient says he was diagnosed 
35932	0	a	as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
35933	0	a	Xian and was treated with steroids at the time.
35934	0	a	It's not clear what CNS 
35935	0	a	or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time.
35936	0	a	Because of complex 
35937	0	a	partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
35938	0	a	referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
35939	0	a	estradiol level was in the 80s.
35940	0	a	His testosterone was up but available 
35941	0	a	testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
35942	0	a	said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures.
35943	0	a	Said he was doing 
35944	0	a	fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred.
35945	0	a	He 
35946	0	a	said his neck felt full and warm.
35947	0	a	His head felt like it was going to 
35948	0	a	explode.
35949	0	a	He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
35950	0	a	vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
35951	0	a	right.
35952	0	a	Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
35953	0	a	postnasal drip.
35954	0	a	Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
35955	0	a	anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
35956	0	a	other results).
35957	0	a	He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
35958	0	a	on his legs.
35959	0	a	No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
35960	0	a	or gum except that he has to wear his glasses.
35961	0	a	Recently had some teeth 
35962	0	a	removed.
35963	0	a	Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough.
35964	0	a	No other 
35965	2	a	cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension.
35966	0	a	No GI 
35967	0	a	problems.
35968	0	a	Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
35969	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR.

36006	0	a	Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on

36008	0	a	One 
36009	0	a	small node in the left side of his neck.

36020	0	a	Extremity, joint exam fine.
36021	0	a	Neurological fine.
36022	0	a	I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
36023	0	a	symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection.
36024	0	a	However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
36025	0	a	and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
36026	0	a	also exclude lupus and vasculitis.
36027	0	a	Basically I told him to take Flonase 
36028	0	a	twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
36029	0	a	cleared up.
36030	0	a	In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
36031	0	a	stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
36032	0	a	testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
36033	0	a	testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease

36035	2	a	hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain.
36036	0	a	Patient 
36037	0	a	also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
36038	0	a	regarding increased appetite, decreased memory, 
36039	0	a	Page 3
36040	0	a	decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
36041	0	a	hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
36042	0	a	cholinergic transmission problems.
36043	0	a	Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
36044	0	a	Aricept to improve his memory.
36045	0	a	Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
36046	0	a	for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted.
36047	0	a	Thank you again for asking me to see him.

36148	0	a	I have been

36150	0	a	several months ago.
36151	0	a	His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
36152	0	a	q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d.
36153	0	a	and atenolol 25mg q.d.
36154	0	a	He apparently went 
36155	0	a	to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
36156	2	a	to have high blood pressure.
36157	0	a	She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
36158	0	a	from 25mg to 50mg.
36159	0	a	He has not yet completed that prescription.
36160	0	a	Mr.

36164	0	a	Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly

36166	0	a	His

36173	0	a	His heart rate is 80.
36174	0	a	Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
36175	0	a	The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no

36182	0	a	He has a

36192	0	a	He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.
36193	0	a	I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
36194	0	a	     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a

36197	0	a	Cholesterol.
36198	0	a	The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.
36199	0	a	Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than

36201	0	a	Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.

36223	0	a	HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
36224	2	a	diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
36225	0	a	checkup.
36226	0	a	Patient appears to be doing fine.
36227	0	a	She has been compliant with her 
36228	0	a	antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
36229	0	a	hydrochlorothiazide.
36230	0	a	Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
36231	0	a	approximately 15 to 20 pounds.
36232	0	a	She has been exercising on a daily basis 
36233	0	a	and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
36234	0	a	beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
36235	0	a	was 120/80 in both arms.
36236	0	a	The patient was complaining of some ankle 
36237	0	a	swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
36238	0	a	on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
36239	0	a	admission.
36240	0	a	I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
36241	0	a	I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
36242	0	a	symptoms over the next few days.
36243	0	a	The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
36244	0	a	chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065.
36245	0	a	We 
36246	0	a	have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
36247	0	a	rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises.
36248	0	a	The 
36249	0	a	patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
36250	0	a	services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain.
36251	0	a	Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming.
36252	0	a	Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
36253	0	a	ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
36254	0	a	agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
36255	0	a	either a mammogram or a Pap smear.
36256	0	a	She complains that she does not have 
36257	0	a	faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
36258	0	a	to and does not want to have done.
36259	0	a	I attempted to discuss the need and why 
36260	0	a	it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
36261	0	a	this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
36262	0	a	refuses either of the two examinations.

36277	0	a	HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.
36278	0	a	The 
36279	0	a	patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
36280	0	a	whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
36281	0	a	"which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of "
36282	2	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.
36283	0	a	As it 
36284	0	a	turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
36285	0	a	beneficial effects of which were unknown.
36286	0	a	We had decided as of our last 
36287	0	a	meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.
36288	0	a	patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
36289	0	a	continue to discontinue this medicine.
36290	0	a	At this point, the patient does 
36291	0	a	not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.
36292	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
36293	0	a	the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
36294	0	a	wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.
36295	0	a	Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.
36296	0	a	It is 
36297	1	a	noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
36298	1	a	the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
36299	0	a	diastolic was 80-90.
36300	0	a	The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
36301	0	a	than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.
36302	0	a	The patient 
36303	0	a	has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
36304	0	a	ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
36305	0	a	remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.
36306	0	a	The patient's 
36307	0	a	cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.
36308	0	a	Review 
36309	0	a	of systems otherwise negative.
36310	0	a	Physical exam is not performed at this time.
36311	1	a	Blood pressure was 152/76 
36312	0	a	on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
36313	0	a	and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
36314	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
36315	0	a	problems coming in for follow-up.
36316	0	a	1.
36317	0	a	Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
36318	2	a	     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
36319	0	a	     hypertrophy.
36320	0	a	The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
36321	0	a	     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
36322	0	a	     standing.
36323	0	a	The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
36324	0	a	     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
36325	0	a	     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.
36326	0	a	If 
36327	0	a	     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
36328	0	a	     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
36329	0	a	2.
36330	0	a	BPH - please see above.
36331	0	a	The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
36332	0	a	3.   ?
36333	0	a	coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
36334	0	a	     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
36335	0	a	     for this gentleman.
36336	0	a	I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
36337	0	a	     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s 
36338	0	a	     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL
36339	0	a	476 Will St                           Vicente, Kadeem
36340	0	a	PAGE 2
36341	0	a	     or low 50s.
36342	0	a	Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
36343	0	a	     therapy.
36344	0	a	I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
36345	0	a	     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
36346	0	a	     will be put on an antilipid drug.
36347	0	a	4.
36348	0	a	GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
36349	0	a	     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
36350	0	a	     point.
36351	0	a	Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
36352	0	a	     placed on Prilosec.
36353	0	a	I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
36354	0	a	his use of Hytrin.

36963	0	a	The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and her chest discomfort has improved.
36964	0	a	She also underwent echocardiography on 03/26/80, which was a fair quality study with a mildly dilated left ventricle, mild LVH, septal flattening consistent with RV pressure overload and an estimated ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.
36965	0	a	Diastolic dysfunction was also noted.
36966	0	a	There was dilatation of both atria and the right ventricle with mildly reduced RV systolic function.
36967	0	a	The aortic valve could not be well visualized.

36994	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home.
36995	0	a	She typically ambulates with a walker, though she has become dyspneic even ambulating a few feet.
36996	0	a	She quit smoking 40 years ago.
36997	0	a	There is no alcohol use.
36998	0	a	She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer.
36999	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.
37000	1	a	Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6.
37001	0	a	JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.
37002	0	a	Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right.
37003	0	a	Air movement is fair.
37004	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
37005	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.
37006	0	a	On heart exam, PMI could not be felt.
37007	0	a	There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.
37008	0	a	There are no rubs or gallops.
37009	0	a	Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
37010	0	a	There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.
37011	0	a	EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG.
37012	0	a	Lab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose.
37013	0	a	Magnesium and calcium were normal.
37014	0	a	Albumin is low at 2.6.
37015	0	a	Liver function tests are normal.
37016	0	a	Creatinine kinase is 15, troponin is 0.7 and B-natriuretic peptide is 2510.
37017	0	a	Thyroid studies are pending.
37018	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7.
37019	0	a	CBC shows mild anemia with hematocrit of 35.8% with normal hemoglobin of 12.2, elevated white count at 13.32 and platelet count of 305,000.
37020	0	a	Coagulation studies are normal.
37021	0	a	IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved.
37022	0	a	The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.
37023	0	a	I think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.
37024	0	a	On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology.
37025	0	a	Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation.
37026	0	a	If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery.
37027	0	a	In addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray.
37028	0	a	Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it.
37029	0	a	Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure.
37030	0	a	Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.

37333	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
37334	0	a	62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.
37335	0	a	This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.
37336	0	a	He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.
37337	0	a	There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.
37338	0	a	There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.
37339	0	a	Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.
37340	0	a	No alteration in medications required.

37807	0	a	"Assessment and Plan	"
37808	2	a	54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.
37809	0	a	Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
37810	0	a	1.
37811	0	a	GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.
37812	0	a	Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
37813	0	a	Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.
37814	0	a	She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.
37815	0	a	Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.
37816	0	a	We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.
37817	0	a	She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.
37818	0	a	We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
37819	0	a	2.
37820	2	a	HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).
37821	0	a	Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.
37822	0	a	In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
37823	0	a	3.
37824	0	a	DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.
37825	0	a	Will monitor BS.
37826	0	a	4.
37827	0	a	Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

38145	0	a	EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE
38146	0	a	I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.
38147	0	a	Forrest.
38148	0	a	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the
38149	0	a	patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's
38150	0	a	chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
38151	0	a	disposition with the patient.
38152	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.
38153	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple
38154	0	a	medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.
38155	0	a	At her
38156	0	a	rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent
38157	0	a	here.
38158	0	a	The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable
38159	0	a	for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent
38160	0	a	hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the
38161	0	a	end of December through the beginning of January.
38162	0	a	The patient's
38163	0	a	chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the
38164	0	a	patient has been doing well at rehab since.
38165	0	a	However, today was
38166	0	a	noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.
38167	0	a	She had
38168	0	a	shortness of breath as well.
38169	0	a	Her oxygen saturations improved
38170	0	a	marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to
38171	0	a	nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.
38172	0	a	The patient was
38173	0	a	treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement
38174	0	a	and is noted to be quite tachypneic.
38175	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,
38176	0	a	diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,
38177	0	a	anemia, and cervical fracture.
38178	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited
38179	0	a	by the severity of the patient's presentation.
38180	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,
38181	0	a	Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,
38182	0	a	Colace, and Xalatan.
38183	0	a	ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.
38184	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some
38185	0	a	degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and
38186	0	a	answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.
38187	0	a	Vital signs are as
38188	1	a	documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,
38189	0	a	and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.
38190	0	a	HEENT exam is
38191	0	a	atraumatic, normal to inspection.
38192	0	a	The patient has a large tongue
38193	0	a	and her uvula is not visible at all.
38194	0	a	Neck is immobilized in a
38195	0	a	C-collar and is obese.
38196	0	a	Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath
38197	0	a	sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory
38198	0	a	use.
38199	0	a	Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without
38200	0	a	murmur.
38201	0	a	Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.
38202	0	a	Abdomen is
38203	0	a	soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or
38204	0	a	masses, or guarding, or rebound.
38205	0	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry
38206	0	a	without any lesions or rash.
38207	0	a	Musculoskeletal exam reveals
38208	0	a	tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib
38209	0	a	fractures.
38210	0	a	Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty
38211	0	a	speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic
38212	0	a	deficit.
38213	0	a	LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.
38214	0	a	White
38215	0	a	blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is
38216	0	a	at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.
38217	0	a	LFTs within
38218	0	a	normal limit.
38219	0	a	INR 1.2.
38220	0	a	D-dimer significantly elevated.
38221	0	a	EKG
38222	0	a	demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
38223	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which
38224	0	a	are present previously but possibly slightly increased.
38225	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given
38226	0	a	Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was
38227	0	a	also started on CPAP.
38228	0	a	She seemed to be improving clinically for
38229	0	a	some period of time but then began to decline in her mental
38230	0	a	status.
38231	0	a	At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.
38232	0	a	Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient
38233	0	a	likely needed intubation.
38234	0	a	We had hope to hold off to do a
38235	0	a	thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines
38236	0	a	such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the
38237	0	a	procedure.
38238	0	a	On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable
38239	0	a	throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory
38240	0	a	distress.
38241	0	a	Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex
38242	0	a	her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful
38243	0	a	in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in
38244	0	a	between those attempts.
38245	0	a	For full details of the procedure,
38246	0	a	please see the attached procedure note.
38247	0	a	Thoracic Surgery was
38248	0	a	consulted.
38249	0	a	They arrived as the patient was being intubated.
38250	0	a	At
38251	0	a	this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to
38252	0	a	determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural
38253	0	a	effusion and whether it is loculated.
38254	0	a	This study will be
38255	0	a	performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in
38256	0	a	the ICU.
38257	0	a	A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and
38258	0	a	the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.
38259	0	a	******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
38260	0	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
38261	0	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.
38262	0	a	TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural
38263	0	a	effusion.
38264	0	a	FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.
38265	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.
38266	0	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

38736	0	a	 Attending Note
38737	0	a	I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.
38738	0	a	I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.
38739	2	a	The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.
38740	0	a	Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.
38741	0	a	CTA was also normal.
38742	0	a	He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past.
38743	0	a	Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.
38744	0	a	His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.
38745	0	a	It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;
38746	0	a	The exam today showed:
38747	0	a	Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
38748	0	a	Left APD
38749	0	a	Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
38750	0	a	Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.
38751	0	a	Was not in UMN fashion.
38752	0	a	Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.
38753	0	a	Assessment:  
38754	0	a	Status post TIA possibly related to AF
38755	0	a	Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
38756	0	a	The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
38757	0	a	Plan:
38758	0	a	Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
38759	0	a	Continue 
38760	0	a	ASA and coumadin and statin

38842	0	a	  MRN: 618-13-82-6
38843	0	a	  Dear Dr. Yingling:
38844	0	a	  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,
38845	0	a	  for her problem of coronary ischemia.
38846	0	a	As you know, Ms.
38847	0	a	  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of
38848	2	a	  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is
38849	0	a	  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest
38850	0	a	  tightness associated with exertion.
38851	0	a	A stress MIBI SPECT
38852	0	a	  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and
38853	0	a	  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex
38854	0	a	  distribution.
38855	0	a	The details of the study include an exercise
38856	0	a	  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and
38857	0	a	  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from
38858	0	a	  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and
38859	0	a	  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a
38860	0	a	  rate pressure product of 33,390).
38861	0	a	The test was stopped due
38862	0	a	  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.
38863	0	a	EKG
38864	0	a	  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and
38865	0	a	  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.
38866	0	a	Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her
38867	0	a	  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and
38868	0	a	  verapamil 240mg q.d.
38869	0	a	A recent lipid panel demonstrated a
38870	0	a	  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.
38871	0	a	On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing
38872	0	a	  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute
38873	0	a	  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.
38874	0	a	Jugular
38875	0	a	  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.
38876	0	a	Carotids
38877	0	a	  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.
38878	0	a	Chest
38879	0	a	  examination was clear to auscultation.
38880	0	a	Heart examination
38881	0	a	  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split
38882	0	a	  S2, no murmurs or rubs.
38883	0	a	Abdominal examination was 
38884	0	a	  Page 2
38885	0	a	  unremarkable.
38886	0	a	Peripheral examination demonstrated no
38887	0	a	  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
38888	0	a	EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
38889	0	a	  EKG.
38890	0	a	I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
38891	0	a	  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
38892	0	a	  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
38893	0	a	  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
38894	0	a	We reviewed the
38895	0	a	  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
38896	0	a	  angiography and possible angioplasty.
38897	0	a	I made no solid
38898	0	a	  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty
38899	0	a	  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
38900	0	a	  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
38901	0	a	  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and
38902	0	a	  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
38903	0	a	  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
38904	0	a	  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
38905	0	a	  tolerance.
38906	0	a	She and her husband are going to reflect on
38907	0	a	  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the
38908	0	a	  week.
38909	0	a	If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography
38910	0	a	  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately
38911	0	a	  in Cardiology.
38912	0	a	I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see
38913	0	a	  her in the office.
38914	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if
38915	0	a	  I can be of any further assistance.
38916	0	a	With warm regards,

39248	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 
39249	0	a	for follow up regarding her diabetes.
39250	0	a	Since I last saw her, she 
39251	0	a	has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 
39252	0	a	October.
39253	0	a	Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 
39254	0	a	repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 
39255	0	a	essentially within normal limits.
39256	0	a	She denies any recurrent flank 
39257	0	a	pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.
39258	0	a	Says overall she is feeling 
39259	0	a	relatively well.
39260	0	a	She is taking all of her medications as 
39261	0	a	prescribed.
39262	0	a	She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 
39263	0	a	fatigue, or blurry vision.
39264	0	a	She continues to smoke.
39265	0	a	She has not 
39266	0	a	been exercising.
39267	0	a	She also continues to have intermittent chest 
39268	0	a	pain of unclear etiology.
39269	0	a	Several days ago, she had an episode 
39270	0	a	that lasted a minute or two at rest.
39271	0	a	She described it as a 
39272	0	a	tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 
39273	0	a	nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.
39274	0	a	She has 
39275	0	a	no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 
39276	0	a	symptoms in the past few days.
39277	0	a	She has not been taking her blood 
39278	0	a	sugars at home as her machine is broken.
39279	0	a	Also, she self-
39280	0	a	discontinued her lisinopril.
39281	0	a	She thought it gave her a headache.
39282	0	a	Page 2
39283	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 
39284	0	a	distress.
39285	0	a	Pulse 68 and regular.
39286	0	a	Blood pressure 134/84 and 
39287	0	a	weight 226.
39288	0	a	Fingerstick today 198.
39289	0	a	Neck veins are non-elevated.
39290	0	a	No carotid bruits.
39291	0	a	Oropharynx is clear.
39292	0	a	Lungs are clear to 
39293	0	a	auscultation bilaterally.
39294	0	a	Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.
39295	0	a	Normal S1 and S2.
39296	0	a	No murmurs.
39297	0	a	Extremities are warm and without 
39298	0	a	edema.
39299	0	a	Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 
39300	0	a	vibration and light touch.
39301	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 
39302	0	a	normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-
39303	0	a	waves.
39304	0	a	Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
39305	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
39306	0	a	problems as follows:
39307	0	a	Type 2 diabetes.
39308	0	a	Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
39309	0	a	the 9.0.
39310	0	a	She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
39311	0	a	try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
39312	0	a	At this point, it 
39313	0	a	is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
39314	0	a	regimen starting with b.i.d.
39315	0	a	NPH, and we will refer her to the 
39316	0	a	diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 
39317	0	a	with a plan to transition her at that time.
39318	0	a	Her urine 
39319	0	a	microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
39320	0	a	We will recheck 
39321	0	a	her hemoglobin A1c today.
39322	0	a	She has been to the ophthalmologist 
39323	0	a	recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
39324	0	a	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 
39325	0	a	pain is somewhat concerning.
39326	0	a	She does have coronary disease 
39327	0	a	as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
39328	0	a	She is taking an 
39329	0	a	aspirin and a beta-blocker.
39330	0	a	Her EKG today is normal, and she 
39331	0	a	has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
39332	0	a	exertion.
39333	0	a	Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 
39334	0	a	pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
39335	0	a	the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 
39336	0	a	and beta-blocker.
39337	0	a	I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
39338	0	a	ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
39339	0	a	referring her to Cardiology.

39342	0	a	"	Page 3"
39343	0	a	"	"
39344	2	a	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 
39345	0	a	prefer better blood pressure control.
39346	0	a	She agreed to try the 
39347	0	a	lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 
39348	0	a	thinks it disagrees with her.
39349	0	a	I told her I felt the headache 
39350	0	a	was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
39351	0	a	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 
39352	0	a	I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 
39353	0	a	today without receiving one.
39354	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

39381	0	a	Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE
39382	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.
39383	0	a	Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.
39384	0	a	In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.
39385	0	a	CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.
39386	0	a	Patient was started on UF heparin.
39387	2	a	PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 
39388	0	a	Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin
39389	0	a	Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.
39390	0	a	Family hx notable for:  Son passed away in    01 with blood clots.
39391	0	a	Pexam:
39392	1	a	Sats 94% on 4L, T 98, P 78, BP 186/86 R 20
39393	0	a	Gen Comfortable.

39399	0	a	Trop 0.22
39400	0	a	Ntbnp 500
39401	0	a	CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.
39402	0	a	ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)
39403	0	a	Impression:
39404	0	a	Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
39405	0	a	Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
39406	0	a	Persistent DVT
39407	0	a	PFO with right to left shunt
39408	0	a	COPD
39409	0	a	Recs:
39410	0	a	Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
39411	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
39412	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
39413	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
39414	0	a	Hypercoag w/u
39415	0	a	Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD
39416	0	a	Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

39653	0	a	RE:  Roberta Vincent
39654	0	a	     MR #380-18-32-2
39655	0	a	Dear Dr. Long:
39656	0	a	Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.
39657	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
39658	0	a	2092.
39659	0	a	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
39660	0	a	Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
39661	0	a	failure of unknown etiology.
39662	0	a	She is six years status post
39663	0	a	hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
39664	0	a	leiomyosarcoma was discovered.
39665	0	a	She has an extensive history of
39666	2	a	hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.
39667	0	a	She had one stillborn
39668	0	a	infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions.
39669	0	a	SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
39670	0	a	Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
39671	0	a	furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
39672	0	a	Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
39673	0	a	250 mg qid.
39674	0	a	On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
39675	0	a	distress.
39676	0	a	Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.
39677	0	a	Temperature
39678	0	a	is normal.
39679	0	a	Pulse is 88 beats per minute.
39680	0	a	Blood pressure is
39681	1	a	178/96.
39682	0	a	There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.
39683	0	a	There is a
39684	0	a	buffalo hump.
39685	0	a	The lungs show scattered wheezing.
39686	0	a	Cardiovascular
39687	0	a	exam is normal.
39688	0	a	There are discolorations of the skin across the
39689	0	a	neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
39690	0	a	raised.
39691	0	a	The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.
39692	0	a	ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.
39693	0	a	The
39694	0	a	extremities show trace edema.
39695	0	a	There are several areas of
39696	0	a	superficial petechiae.
39697	0	a	In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
39698	0	a	unclear etiology.
39699	0	a	She does report an episode of lower extremity
39700	0	a	swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.
39701	0	a	ThisRoberta Vincent
39702	0	a	MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
39703	0	a	raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
39704	0	a	in a chronic phase.
39705	0	a	Other diagnostic possibilities include other
39706	0	a	forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
39707	0	a	erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions.
39708	0	a	Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
39709	0	a	time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
39710	0	a	risk due to her body habitus.
39711	0	a	I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
39712	0	a	Vincent.
39713	0	a	Although she has no medical conditions which would
39714	0	a	preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
39715	0	a	obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
39716	0	a	hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.
39717	0	a	I have
39718	0	a	encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
39719	0	a	order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
39720	0	a	transplantation.
39721	0	a	Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
39722	0	a	of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
39723	0	a	been performed previously.
39724	0	a	I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
39725	0	a	kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
39726	0	a	meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
39727	0	a	fistula or placement of a graft.
39728	0	a	Thank you once again for your kind referral.

40064	0	a	The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone.
40065	0	a	She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery.
40066	0	a	Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well.
40067	0	a	No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel.

40117	0	a	IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
40118	0	a	The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia.
40119	0	a	Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out.
40120	0	a	The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable.
40121	0	a	Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms.
40122	0	a	ECG warrants following.
40123	0	a	Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.

41439	0	a	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest discomfort.
41440	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 
41441	0	a	who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the 
41442	0	a	night, last night, and into today.
41443	0	a	He finally took nitroglycerin 
41444	0	a	tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest 
41445	0	a	discomfort.
41446	0	a	The patient has known history of coronary artery 
41447	0	a	disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, 
41448	0	a	however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more 
41449	0	a	tire than usual.
41450	0	a	He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 
41451	0	a	rested throughout the rest of the day.
41452	0	a	Then last night, he had 
41453	0	a	some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of.
41454	0	a	Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 
41455	0	a	morning hours.
41456	0	a	He felt he was wheezing.
41457	0	a	This resolved after he 
41458	0	a	got up and walked around.
41459	0	a	He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 
41460	0	a	morning.
41461	0	a	These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 
41462	0	a	obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.
41463	0	a	He then came in 
41464	0	a	to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the 
41465	0	a	emergency department for evaluation.
41466	0	a	Please see the handwritten 
41467	0	a	emergency department record for additional details.
41468	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease 
41469	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency 
41470	0	a	department record.
41471	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not 
41472	0	a	tachypneic.
41473	1	a	His blood pressure is 160/80.
41474	0	a	His heart rate is in 
41475	0	a	the 50s.
41476	0	a	There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on 
41477	0	a	examination.
41478	0	a	There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs 
41479	0	a	are clear to auscultation.
41480	0	a	His heart examination is distant, with 
41481	0	a	no murmurs or gallops appreciated.
41482	0	a	His extremities have trace 
41483	0	a	edema.
41484	0	a	Abdomen in soft and non-tender.
41485	0	a	Pulses are equal.
41486	0	a	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle 
41487	0	a	branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous 
41488	0	a	tracings.
41489	0	a	His other laboratory studies are pending.
41490	0	a	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his 
41491	0	a	physician, Dr. Echeverria.
41492	0	a	We both agree that the patient has 
41493	0	a	probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible 
41494	0	a	unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and 
41495	0	a	paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
41496	0	a	It is possible that he has silent 
41497	0	a	ischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch 
41498	0	a	pattern.
41499	0	a	Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being 
41500	0	a	sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for 
41501	0	a	further medical management.
41502	0	a	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery 
41503	0	a	disease.
41504	0	a	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
41505	0	a	admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

41860	0	a	Patient Name: YOUNT, PATRICIA;  MRN: 4711083
41861	0	a	Dictated on: 10/24/2088 by YOEL NEWCOMB, M.D.
41862	0	a	Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.
41863	0	a	She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.
41864	0	a	Brought her in to have an evaluation.
41865	0	a	X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.
41866	2	a	Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.
41867	0	a	No prior surgeries.
41868	0	a	No medications.
41869	0	a	No known drug allergies.
41870	0	a	Lists no family history of any problems.
41871	0	a	Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.
41872	0	a	On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.
41873	0	a	No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.
41874	0	a	Negative scaphoid shift test.
41875	0	a	Slight tenderness over the distal radius.
41876	0	a	Normal tendon function.
41877	0	a	My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

41922	0	a	1.
41923	0	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
41924	0	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
41925	0	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
41926	0	a	2.
41927	0	a	BPH.
41928	0	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
41929	0	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
41930	0	a	3.
41931	0	a	Hypertension.
41932	0	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
41933	0	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
41934	0	a	4.
41935	0	a	COPD.
41936	0	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
41937	0	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
41938	0	a	5.
41939	0	a	Elevated cholesterol.
41940	0	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
41941	0	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
41942	0	a	6.
41943	0	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
41944	0	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
41945	0	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
41946	0	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

42095	0	a	Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.
42096	0	a	She has been in Rhode Island for 
42097	0	a	six months.
42098	0	a	Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.
42099	0	a	She 
42100	0	a	does not have any palpitations.
42101	0	a	She does not note that this is 
42102	0	a	associated with exertion.
42103	0	a	She does have diaphoresis associated with it.
42104	0	a	She does not have any shortness of breath.
42105	0	a	This heaviness has been in 
42106	0	a	her chest on and off for the last six weeks.
42107	0	a	She is quite concerned.
42108	2	a	She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.
42109	0	a	She also has 
42110	0	a	hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.

42112	0	a	maintenance has been in order.
42113	0	a	She has just had a hysterectomy.
42114	0	a	needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.
42115	0	a	However, today I am most 
42116	0	a	concerned about her chest heaviness.
42117	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
42118	0	a	20 and pulse is 68.
42119	0	a	Neck is supple.
42120	0	a	There is no lymphadenopathy.
42121	0	a	Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.

42135	0	a	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
42136	0	a	We also sent her for an exercise 
42137	0	a	tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
42138	0	a	maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
42139	0	a	seconds.
42140	0	a	She had no evidence of ischemia.
42141	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
42142	0	a	1.
42143	0	a	Chest heaviness.
42144	0	a	I am not sure what is causing this.

42146	0	a	primary pulmonary problem.
42147	0	a	She will be following up with us in one 
42148	0	a	week.

42272	0	a	ASSESSMENT & PLAN
42273	0	a	87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.
42274	0	a	The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
42275	0	a	Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.
42276	0	a	Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
42277	0	a	However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.
42278	0	a	Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
42279	0	a	As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
42280	0	a	LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
42281	0	a	One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.
42282	0	a	A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
42283	0	a	Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly.
42284	0	a	However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
42285	0	a	Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative.
42286	0	a	CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
42287	0	a	Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
42288	0	a	will d/w attending
42289	0	a	consider psychiatric consult
42290	0	a	Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
42291	0	a	Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH
42292	0	a	H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.
42293	0	a	NIDDM: Will start RISS
42294	0	a	Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD
42295	2	a	HTN: metoprolol
42296	0	a	Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

44399	0	a	Dear Dr.  Morgan:
44400	0	a	  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.
44401	0	a	She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago.
44402	2	a	She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD.
44403	0	a	She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine.
44404	0	a	She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler.
44405	0	a	With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.
44406	0	a	She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time.
44407	0	a	These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week.
44408	0	a	She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.
44409	0	a	To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
44410	0	a	This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery.
44411	0	a	There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery.
44412	0	a	She was then referred to me for further evaluation.
44413	0	a	Past medical history:
44414	0	a	   Hypertension.

44445	0	a	She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.
44446	0	a	She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.
44447	0	a	She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.
44448	0	a	No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.
44449	0	a	She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.
44450	0	a	She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.
44451	0	a	She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.
44452	0	a	Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.
44453	0	a	Physical examination:
44454	0	a	-Pulse:   70
44455	1	a	-BP: 142/70  
44456	0	a	-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest
44457	0	a	-Skin:   Free of rashes
44458	0	a	-Heent:   benign
44459	0	a	-Neck:   JVP was at 5.

44465	0	a	-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented
44466	0	a	-weight:   185 pounds
44467	0	a	"			EKG:"
44468	0	a	    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.
44469	0	a	Assessment and plan:
44470	2	a	   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past.
44471	0	a	She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy.
44472	0	a	Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm.
44473	0	a	I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan.
44474	0	a	She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.
44475	0	a	Plan: 
44476	0	a	1.
44477	0	a	Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.
44478	0	a	2.
44479	0	a	Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.
44480	0	a	3.
44481	0	a	I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.
44482	0	a	4.
44483	0	a	I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

45419	2	a	It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.
45420	2	a	Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.

45537	0	a	HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.
45538	0	a	He is status post TURP by Dr. 
45539	0	a	Nixon.
45540	0	a	He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
45541	0	a	thinks that this should get better.
45542	0	a	We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
45543	0	a	range.
45544	0	a	We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
45545	0	a	that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
45546	0	a	dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
45547	0	a	He has remained on digoxin status 
45548	0	a	post his myocardial infarction.
45549	0	a	We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
45550	0	a	We also have been concerned 
45551	0	a	that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
45552	0	a	about his wife's situation with breast cancer.
45553	0	a	We had a long discussion 
45554	0	a	about this.
45555	0	a	Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.
45556	1	a	His blood pressure was 178/80.
45557	0	a	The follow-up was 170/80.
45558	0	a	His neck was 
45559	0	a	supple.
45560	0	a	Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.
45561	0	a	Cardiac 
45562	0	a	exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
45563	0	a	Abdomen 
45564	0	a	was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
45565	0	a	Extremities were 
45566	0	a	clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
45567	0	a	Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
45568	0	a	negative.
45569	0	a	Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.
45570	0	a	Platelets were within normal 
45571	0	a	limits.
45572	0	a	White count is 8.3.
45573	0	a	Digoxin is 0.9.
45574	0	a	Lytes are within normal 
45575	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
45576	0	a	1.
45577	0	a	Status post TURP.
45578	0	a	He appears to be recovering well.
45579	0	a	He has had 
45580	0	a	     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
45581	0	a	2.
45582	0	a	Thrombocytopenia.
45583	0	a	This was very relative.
45584	0	a	It now appears to have 
45585	0	a	     resolved.
45586	0	a	3.
45587	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
45588	0	a	As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
45589	0	a	     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.
45590	0	a	At 
45591	0	a	     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
45592	0	a	     Lasix.
45593	0	a	However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
45594	0	a	     treatment with anti-anginals.
45595	0	a	4.
45596	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
45597	0	a	This has been well-controlled recently.
45598	0	a	His 
45599	0	a	     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
45600	0	a	5.
45601	0	a	Depression.
45602	0	a	He continues on Ambien.
45603	0	a	He has some discretion about 
45604	0	a	     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
45605	0	a	     uncertainty resolved.

45640	0	a	HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.
45641	0	a	The patient 
45642	2	a	is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
45643	0	a	coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
45644	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.
45645	0	a	The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.
45646	0	a	With regard to the 
45647	0	a	latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
45648	0	a	initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
45649	0	a	notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
45650	0	a	uncomfortable with this.
45651	0	a	He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
45652	0	a	pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
45653	0	a	of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.
45654	0	a	The patient knows the foods that give 
45655	0	a	him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
45656	0	a	avoid them as much as possible.
45657	0	a	The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
45658	0	a	which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
45659	0	a	would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
45660	0	a	blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
45661	0	a	we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).
45662	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
45663	0	a	the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
45664	0	a	of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.
45665	0	a	The patient does remain on 
45666	2	a	Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
45667	1	a	pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
45668	0	a	minutes later was 130/74.
45669	0	a	The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.
45670	0	a	No positive

45673	0	a	Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me

45675	0	a	respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.

45680	0	a	The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as

45682	0	a	His blood pressure 
45683	0	a	     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
45684	0	a	One of the issues 
45685	0	a	     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.
45686	0	a	"The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and "
45687	0	a	     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
45688	0	a	     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
45689	0	a	     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his

45709	0	a	The patient does take Lasix

45720	0	a	     would like to stay on this.
45721	0	a	Patient has enough to last until I see

45723	0	a	I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The

45846	0	a	Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.
45847	0	a	Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.
45848	0	a	Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.
45849	0	a	Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.
45850	0	a	Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.
45851	0	a	Recommend:
45852	0	a	Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
45853	0	a	Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
45854	0	a	Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
45855	0	a	Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g.
45856	0	a	Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
45857	0	a	Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

46337	0	a	HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
46338	0	a	up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
46339	0	a	past 2 weeks.
46340	0	a	When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very
46341	0	a	dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
46342	0	a	to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
46343	0	a	creatinine and BUN.
46344	0	a	She responded well to this and then did
46345	0	a	well for a week or so.
46346	0	a	Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
46347	0	a	increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening.
46348	0	a	Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is
46349	0	a	up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.
46350	0	a	Of
46351	0	a	note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it
46352	0	a	was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.
46353	0	a	She reports her
46354	0	a	blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from
46355	0	a	90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.
46356	0	a	She
46357	0	a	has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
46358	0	a	months.
46359	0	a	She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
46360	0	a	Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.
46361	0	a	reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
46362	0	a	normal as well.
46363	0	a	She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased
46364	0	a	shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.
46365	0	a	No fever or
46366	0	a	chills.
46367	0	a	Remainder review of systems negative.
46368	0	a	She does
46369	0	a	report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
46370	0	a	has had but has noted it over the past few months.
46371	0	a	MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.
46372	0	a	ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.
46373	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
46374	0	a	distress.
46375	0	a	Her skin is very tanned.
46376	1	a	Blood pressure 148/62,
46377	1	a	on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight
46378	0	a	is up about 6 pounds for her.
46379	0	a	HEENT within normal limits.
46380	0	a	Neck: no JVD.
46381	0	a	Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
46382	0	a	crackles or rhonchi.
46383	0	a	Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,
46384	0	a	II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.
46385	0	a	Abdomen is
46386	0	a	benign.
46387	0	a	Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
46388	0	a	mid shin.
46389	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
46390	0	a	New pedal edema.
46391	0	a	Reviewing patient's recent lab results,
46392	0	a	she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
46393	0	a	the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
46394	0	a	improved.
46395	0	a	I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
46396	0	a	Norvasc.
46397	0	a	Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and
46398	0	a	she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
46399	0	a	it may take a few days to resolve.
46400	0	a	Will consider increasing
46401	0	a	her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
46402	0	a	Norvasc and her labs.
46403	0	a	Will check basic metabolic panel and
46404	0	a	urinalysis as well.
46405	2	a	Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.
46406	0	a	Will start
46407	0	a	atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
46408	0	a	the next few days.
46409	0	a	Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
46410	0	a	to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
46411	0	a	for a repeat blood pressure check.
46412	0	a	The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
46413	0	a	appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
46414	0	a	see if there is anything more we can do to change her
46415	0	a	insulin regimen.
46416	0	a	The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
46417	0	a	otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
46418	0	a	sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

46712	0	a	HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar strokes who presents with L arm numbness.
46713	0	a	Patient was sitting on her couch this morning between 9-10 AM when she began to have L arm numbness.
46714	0	a	She initially thought it was from leaning on her arm but it did not improve when she moved.
46715	0	a	She also noted that it was not in any particular nerve distribution.
46716	0	a	Aside from this deficit, she denies any H/A, LOC, dizziness, blurry vision, facial droop, weakness, or aphasia.
46717	0	a	Her symptoms persisted for about 12 hours and then spontaneously resolved.
46718	0	a	Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.

46870	0	a	While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke.
46871	0	a	These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli.
46872	0	a	Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

46883	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
46884	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in
46885	0	a	transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively
46886	0	a	worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated
46887	0	a	with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday.
46888	0	a	He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,
46889	0	a	progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal

46891	0	a	He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which
46892	0	a	did radiate to his left shoulder.
46893	0	a	This seemed to resolve
46894	0	a	spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind
46895	0	a	of exertion at all.

46910	0	a	Additionally, at the outside Emergency
46911	0	a	Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,
46912	0	a	but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.
46913	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally

46924	1	a	20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
46925	0	a	HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
46926	0	a	Pleasant, calm.
46927	0	a	Neck is
46928	0	a	supple.
46929	0	a	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for
46930	0	a	scattered rales in the left lower lung field.
46931	0	a	Cardiovascular: 
46932	0	a	Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
46933	0	a	Abdomen is soft and
46934	0	a	nontender.
46935	0	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
46936	0	a	Extremities:  He has
46937	0	a	got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is
46938	0	a	symmetric.
46939	0	a	Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities
46940	0	a	equally.
46941	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave

46943	0	a	Chest x-ray
46944	0	a	shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural
46945	0	a	effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild
46946	0	a	pulmonary edema.
46947	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with

46949	0	a	BNP is still pending.
46950	0	a	INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on
46951	0	a	Coumadin.
46952	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency
46953	0	a	Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2
46954	0	a	liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic
46955	0	a	improvement in his dyspnea.
46956	0	a	He has no further episodes of chest
46957	0	a	pain or pressure.
46958	0	a	I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,
46959	0	a	the SAH cardiologist on-call.
46960	0	a	I believe this patient has CHF
46961	0	a	exacerbation.
46962	0	a	He also was recently cardioverted, which ____
46963	0	a	explain his troponin elevation.
46964	0	a	Additionally, his CHF
46965	0	a	exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I
46966	0	a	doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
46967	0	a	At this point,
46968	0	a	the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on
46969	0	a	We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at
46970	0	a	this time.
46971	0	a	However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will
46972	0	a	be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for
46973	0	a	further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart
46974	0	a	failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.
46975	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin
46976	0	a	elevation, and diabetes.
46977	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

47058	0	a	   DOB: 8/6/2075
47059	0	a	Dear Dr. Keller,
47060	0	a	Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
47061	0	a	Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
47062	0	a	We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
47063	2	a	"HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband."
47064	0	a	This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.
47065	0	a	She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
47066	0	a	In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
47067	0	a	The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.
47068	0	a	In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.
47069	0	a	She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.
47070	0	a	She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.
47071	0	a	She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.
47072	0	a	The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.
47073	0	a	She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.
47074	0	a	Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.
47075	0	a	CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
47076	0	a	She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.
47077	0	a	Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.
47078	0	a	She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.
47079	0	a	ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
47080	0	a	Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).
47081	0	a	She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.
47082	0	a	Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.
47083	0	a	In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.
47084	0	a	Past Medical History: 
47085	0	a	CAD s/p LAD stent 2144

47156	2	a	Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.
47157	0	a	Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.
47158	0	a	At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
47159	0	a	Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.
47160	0	a	We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.
47161	0	a	She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.
47162	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
47163	0	a	We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

48493	0	a	Name:  Xochilt Vuong
48494	0	a	MRN:  6398353
48495	0	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.
48496	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 
48497	0	a	going back more than 10 years.
48498	2	a	She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 
48499	0	a	over approximately the same period of time.
48500	0	a	She has a complicated history 
48501	0	a	including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.
48502	0	a	Her 
48503	0	a	creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 
48504	0	a	1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 
48505	0	a	obtained on July 06, 2064.
48506	0	a	She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.
48507	0	a	Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 
48508	0	a	at 81.
48509	0	a	Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 
48510	0	a	proteinuria since that time.
48511	0	a	Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 
48512	0	a	March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 
48513	0	a	obstruction, stones, or masses.
48514	0	a	She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
48515	0	a	She does 
48516	0	a	not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 
48517	0	a	for any proliferative retinopathy.
48518	0	a	Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 
48519	0	a	almost constant nausea.
48520	0	a	She vomits rarely.
48521	0	a	Her weight has fallen by about 20 
48522	0	a	pounds.
48523	0	a	She is slightly constipated.
48524	0	a	She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.

48550	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 
48551	0	a	reasonably comfortable.
48552	0	a	She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 
48553	0	a	which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
48554	0	a	Her blood pressure in 
48555	1	a	the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.
48556	0	a	Her chest has a few basal 
48557	0	a	crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
48558	0	a	JVP fills below the 
48559	0	a	sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 
48560	0	a	sternal border.
48561	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
48562	0	a	There is no renal tenderness.
48563	0	a	Extremities have no edema.
48564	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
48565	2	a	10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
48566	0	a	The 
48567	0	a	proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 
48568	0	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
48569	0	a	It would be useful to know 
48570	0	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
48571	0	a	It is, of course, also 
48572	0	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
48573	0	a	Their symmetry and 
48574	0	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
48575	0	a	The ACE 
48576	0	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
48577	0	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
48578	0	a	Her loss of appetite and 
48579	0	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
48580	0	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
48581	0	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
48582	0	a	hyperlipidemia.
48583	0	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
48584	0	a	It think it 
48585	0	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
48586	0	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
48587	0	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
48588	0	a	If, of course, shortness of 
48589	0	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
48590	0	a	reasonable.
48591	0	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
48592	0	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
48593	0	a	requirement for Lasix.
48594	0	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
48595	0	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
48596	0	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
48597	0	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
48598	0	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
48599	0	a	Aranesp).
48600	0	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
48601	0	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
48602	0	a	If so, the 
48603	0	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
48604	0	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
48605	0	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
48606	0	a	It would 
48607	0	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
48608	0	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
48609	0	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
48610	0	a	a need for it arises.
48611	0	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
48612	0	a	done in the next few months.
48613	0	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
48614	0	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
48615	0	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
48616	0	a	these measures as necessary.
48617	0	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
48618	0	a	Wanda
48619	0	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
48620	0	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
48621	0	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
48622	0	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

48827	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
48828	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
48829	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
48830	2	a	Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
48831	0	a	She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.
48832	0	a	This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.
48833	0	a	Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
48834	0	a	Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.
48835	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
48836	0	a	She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.
48837	0	a	She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.
48838	0	a	Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.
48839	0	a	She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.
48840	0	a	Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.
48841	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
48842	0	a	Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
48843	0	a	However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.
48844	0	a	She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.
48845	0	a	She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.
48846	0	a	She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.
48847	0	a	She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.
48848	0	a	She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
48849	0	a	"She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

48920	2	a	58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
48921	0	a	She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.
48922	0	a	We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
48923	0	a	The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.
48924	0	a	If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.
48925	2	a	However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.
48926	0	a	Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.
48927	0	a	Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
48928	0	a	Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.
48929	0	a	I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.
48930	0	a	She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
48931	0	a	If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.
48932	0	a	Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.
48933	0	a	Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.
48934	0	a	Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
48935	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
48936	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
48937	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.

49083	0	a	HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
49084	0	a	This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time.
49085	0	a	Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074.
49086	0	a	Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG.
49087	0	a	In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal.
49088	0	a	She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD.
49089	0	a	She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.

49697	0	a	Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.
49698	0	a	Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.
49699	0	a	I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.

50353	0	a	For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible.
50354	0	a	As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27.
50355	0	a	Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy.
50356	0	a	On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
50357	0	a	The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed.
50358	0	a	After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

51486	0	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
51487	0	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
51488	0	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
51489	0	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
51490	0	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
51491	0	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
51492	0	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
51493	0	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
51494	0	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

51689	0	a	Post, IN  86454
51690	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
51691	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
51692	0	a	As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.
51693	0	a	He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.
51694	0	a	Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.
51695	0	a	Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.
51696	0	a	He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.
51697	0	a	He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.
51698	0	a	Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.
51699	0	a	He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.
51700	0	a	Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
51701	0	a	As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.
51702	0	a	He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.
51703	0	a	He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
51704	0	a	Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).
51705	0	a	Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
51706	0	a	He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
51707	0	a	His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o.
51708	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
51709	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
51710	0	a	daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o.
51711	0	a	daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o.
51712	0	a	daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
51713	0	a	daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily.
51714	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
51715	0	a	Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.
51716	0	a	He is in no distress.
51717	0	a	Weight is 221 lbs.
51718	1	a	Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.
51719	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.
51720	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
51721	0	a	His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
51722	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
51723	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
51724	0	a	He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.
51725	0	a	EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.
51726	0	a	We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
51727	0	a	He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
51728	0	a	His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL.
51729	0	a	His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.
51730	0	a	HbA1c is 7.2%.
51731	0	a	The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.
51732	0	a	Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
51733	0	a	To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:
51734	0	a	1.
51735	0	a	Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.
51736	0	a	2.
51737	0	a	Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.
51738	0	a	Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
51739	0	a	3.
51740	0	a	He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.
51741	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.

51743	0	a	The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.

51754	0	a	     MR #401-10-87-8
51755	0	a	Dear Jac:
51756	0	a	I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today
51757	0	a	and he seems like he is improved.
51758	0	a	He feels his legs are better and
51759	0	a	that he can walk greater distances.
51760	0	a	He feels very comfortable.
51761	0	a	His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
51762	0	a	Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day.
51763	1	a	On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
51764	0	a	65 and regular.
51765	0	a	Weight 210 pounds.
51766	0	a	Head and neck unremarkable.
51767	0	a	Chest is clear.
51768	0	a	Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
51769	0	a	systolic ejection murmur.
51770	0	a	The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
51771	0	a	Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
51772	0	a	sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation.
51773	0	a	There is a nonspecific
51774	0	a	intraventricular conduction delay.
51775	0	a	I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well.
51776	0	a	He would like to have his
51777	0	a	arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
51778	0	a	schedule.
51779	0	a	In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
51780	0	a	if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
51781	0	a	more prolonged risk prevention.
51782	0	a	I suggest that we increase it to 50
51783	0	a	mg bid.
51784	0	a	I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
51785	0	a	eye on it.
51786	0	a	If it drops too low we can reduce the dose.
51787	0	a	He asked
51788	0	a	that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
51789	0	a	and I will be happy to do so.
51790	0	a	If any problems develop in the
51791	0	a	interim please do not hesitate to contact me.
51792	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
51793	0	a	Kindest regards.

52535	0	a	RE: Otis Narvaez
52536	0	a	        MR   #04561326
52537	0	a	Dear Dr. Huynh:
52538	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 
52539	0	a	consultation.
52540	0	a	As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 
52541	2	a	of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
52542	0	a	Recently, he underwent 
52543	0	a	evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 
52544	0	a	dobutamine stress echocardiography.
52545	0	a	The echocardiogram revealed reduced 
52546	0	a	left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.
52547	0	a	There was no evidence of ischemia.
52548	0	a	He subsequently underwent coronary 
52549	0	a	catheterization.
52550	0	a	I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 
52551	0	a	told that he had no arterial blockages.
52552	0	a	Symptomatically, he is 
52553	0	a	significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.
52554	0	a	He has attributed 
52555	0	a	this to his weight.
52556	0	a	He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 
52557	0	a	although he has not been taking either of these medications.
52558	0	a	Prior to 
52559	0	a	his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 
52560	0	a	upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.
52561	0	a	This was confirmed 
52562	0	a	subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 
52563	0	a	lung malignancy.
52564	0	a	He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 
52565	0	a	you.
52566	2	a	His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 
52567	0	a	back pain, and obesity.
52568	0	a	Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 
52569	0	a	q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.
52570	0	a	No drug allergies
52571	0	a	Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.
52572	0	a	Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.
52573	0	a	He smoked for 
52574	0	a	40 years but quit approximately three years ago.

52579	0	a	Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.
52580	0	a	He denies 
52581	0	a	gastrointestinal complaints.
52582	0	a	On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 
52583	0	a	140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.
52584	0	a	HEENT is unremarkable, neck 
52585	0	a	supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 
52586	0	a	without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 
52587	0	a	regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 
52588	0	a	murmurs or rubs.
52589	0	a	Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 
52590	0	a	CVA tenderness.
52591	0	a	No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
52592	0	a	Pulses full.
52593	0	a	Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 
52594	0	a	function by echocardiogram.
52595	0	a	By report he has no evidence of coronary 
52596	0	a	artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.
52597	0	a	If indeed 
52598	0	a	it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 
52599	0	a	this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 
52600	0	a	his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.
52601	0	a	In any case, this 
52602	0	a	puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 
52603	0	a	than if he had significant coronary disease.
52604	0	a	I see no reason why you 
52605	0	a	should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.
52606	0	a	Prior 
52607	0	a	to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.
52608	0	a	I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 
52609	0	a	to South Side Hospital.

52646	0	a	Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
52647	0	a	Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
52648	0	a	A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 
52649	0	a	""" Hematoma around right subclavian artery."
52650	0	a	Narrowing of the artery.
52651	0	a	Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.
52652	0	a	"If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained."""
52653	0	a	On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
52654	0	a	His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses.
52655	0	a	There are no thrills or bruits.
52656	0	a	My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:
52657	0	a	1).
52658	0	a	Hematoma- to be expected
52659	0	a	2).
52660	0	a	Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
52661	0	a	3).
52662	0	a	Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
52663	0	a	4).
52664	0	a	Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
52665	0	a	Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
52666	0	a	This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
52667	0	a	If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it.
52668	0	a	He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
52669	0	a	There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

53000	0	a	Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098
53001	0	a	ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
53002	0	a	Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
53003	0	a	History of Present Illness:
53004	0	a	"	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery."
53005	0	a	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.
53006	0	a	If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
53007	0	a	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
53008	0	a	Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
53009	0	a	His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.
53010	0	a	A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
53011	0	a	There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
53012	0	a	The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).
53013	0	a	An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
53014	0	a	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
53015	0	a	He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
53016	0	a	He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.
53017	0	a	He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
53018	0	a	He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.
53019	0	a	His lasix dose has not changed.
53020	0	a	He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
53021	0	a	He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.
53022	0	a	A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

53108	0	a	Impression and Plan:
53109	0	a	This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
53110	0	a	The issues include:
53111	0	a	Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
53112	0	a	I would consider:
53113	0	a	increasing his diuretic (eg.
53114	0	a	Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
53115	0	a	Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
53116	0	a	He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
53117	0	a	consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
53118	0	a	consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
53119	0	a	Prevention of periperative MI
53120	0	a	He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
53121	0	a	No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
53122	0	a	Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
53123	0	a	Prevention of perioperative AF
53124	0	a	Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
53125	0	a	Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
53126	0	a	Endocarditis prophylaxis
53127	0	a	He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
53128	0	a	We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.
