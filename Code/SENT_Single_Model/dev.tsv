3	0	a	MRN: 78361343
4	0	a	DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04
5	0	a	Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness
6	0	a	HPI:   
7	0	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
8	0	a	Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note).
9	0	a	Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.
10	0	a	She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months.
11	0	a	Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly.
12	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
13	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
14	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
15	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
16	0	a	She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
17	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
18	11	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
19	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
20	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
21	0	a	Cultures were negative.
22	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
23	0	a	She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily.
24	0	a	In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
25	0	a	This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin.
26	0	a	Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.
27	0	a	Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance.
28	0	a	Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls.
29	0	a	Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down.
30	0	a	Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused.
31	0	a	She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom.
32	0	a	It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days.
33	0	a	Patient reports intermittent headaches.
34	0	a	On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities.

138	0	a	Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
139	0	a	There is bilateral exophthalmus.
140	0	a	CXR: today
141	0	a	Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia.
142	0	a	Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.
143	0	a	EKG: sinus tachy.
144	0	a	no ST changes or Q waves.
145	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
146	0	a	69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion.
147	0	a	Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.
148	0	a	Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities.
149	0	a	Head CT unremarkable.
150	0	a	Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid.
151	0	a	She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP.
152	0	a	She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.
153	0	a	This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion.
154	0	a	CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.
155	0	a	-check her gait
156	0	a	-check ESR
157	0	a	-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
158	0	a	-MRI of the brain
159	0	a	-EEG
160	0	a	-further lab w/u pending LP results
161	0	a	-remove foley catheter

343	78	a	She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.
344	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.
345	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
346	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.
347	0	a	Her O2 saturation is 95%.
348	0	a	Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.
349	0	a	Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.
350	0	a	Her nares are without discharge.
351	0	a	Oropharynx with dentures.
352	0	a	She has no erythema or exudate.
353	0	a	Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.
354	0	a	Her thorax is kyphotic.
355	0	a	She has normal fremitus and percussion.
356	0	a	Her lungs are clear.
357	0	a	Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.
358	0	a	Abdomen is soft.
359	0	a	Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
360	0	a	She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.
361	0	a	She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.
362	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.
363	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.
364	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.
365	0	a	This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
366	0	a	At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
367	0	a	Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
368	0	a	She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
369	0	a	I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
370	0	a	She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
371	0	a	She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
372	0	a	Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.
373	0	a	If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

437	0	a	RE:  Peggy Tinsley
438	0	a	     MR #236-67-03-3
439	0	a	Dear Dr. Ventura:
440	0	a	Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.
441	0	a	This patient
442	14	a	with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
443	0	a	on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.
444	0	a	She has been doing well
445	0	a	except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
446	0	a	the past week.
447	0	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
448	0	a	pain.
449	0	a	She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.
450	0	a	Her blood
451	0	a	sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.
452	0	a	Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
453	50	a	Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
454	0	a	NPH 10 units qam.
455	0	a	On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
456	0	a	dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.
457	0	a	CBC at the time
458	0	a	revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.
459	0	a	Blood
460	0	a	cultures were sent.
461	0	a	On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
462	0	a	and a pulse of 88.
463	0	a	She was afebrile.
464	0	a	Head and neck examination
465	0	a	was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.
466	0	a	On cardiovascular
467	0	a	examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
468	0	a	peripheral edema.
469	0	a	Heart sounds were normal.
470	0	a	Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
471	0	a	protein and 2+ glucose.
472	0	a	Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center.
473	0	a	There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection.
474	0	a	She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
475	0	a	tract infection.
476	0	a	Because of her early satiety she has been
477	0	a	eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
478	0	a	gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.
479	0	a	-2-
480	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to be involved in the care of this

1155	0	a	RE:  Michael Isenberg
1156	0	a	HCC# - 367-41-93
1157	0	a	Dear Dr. Uher:
1158	0	a	I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.
1159	14	a	As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.
1160	2	a	He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.
1161	0	a	He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.
1162	0	a	Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.
1163	0	a	He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.
1164	0	a	I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.
1165	0	a	On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.
1166	0	a	His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.
1167	0	a	His lungs were clear bilaterally.
1168	0	a	He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.
1169	37	a	His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.
1170	0	a	Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.
1171	0	a	I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.
1172	0	a	If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.
1173	0	a	Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.
1174	0	a	Sincerely,

1319	0	a	Shortness of breath
1320	0	a	History of The Present Illness:  
1321	27	a	"	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath."
1322	0	a	He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis.
1323	0	a	He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication.
1324	0	a	His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper.
1325	0	a	He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.
1326	0	a	On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness.
1327	0	a	He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.
1328	0	a	This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted.
1329	0	a	The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths.

1685	0	a	RE:Etheridge, Shari
1686	0	a	PMH:94482315
1687	0	a	July 13, 2087
1688	0	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative appointment.
1689	0	a	HPI:  Shari is an 83-year-old female who on March 21, 2087 underwent an 
1690	0	a	ileocecectomy for ischemic bowel.
1691	0	a	Two weeks prior to her presentation 
1692	0	a	to the Parkview Memorial Hospital she underwent a stent placement to 
1693	0	a	her SMA.
1694	0	a	After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then 
1695	0	a	returned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of 
1696	0	a	right lower quadrant pain.
1697	0	a	CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal 
1698	0	a	thickening with fat stranding locally.
1699	0	a	She subsequently was taken to 
1700	0	a	the operating room.
1701	0	a	Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she 
1702	0	a	was discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.
1703	0	a	Her complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating 
1704	0	a	to iron intake.
1705	0	a	She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk 
1706	0	a	of magnesia for this.
1707	0	a	She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, 
1708	0	a	which she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.
1709	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest 
1710	0	a	pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
1711	0	a	or calf pain.
1712	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent 
1713	0	a	distress.
1714	0	a	She is accompanied today by her daughter.
1715	0	a	Her weight is 164 
1716	0	a	pounds.
1717	0	a	Her vital signs are 103/80, 70, 16, 96.6.
1718	0	a	Her abdomen is 
1719	0	a	soft, nontender and nondistended.
1720	0	a	Her midline incision is well healed 
1721	0	a	with no evidence of hernia.
1722	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Ischemic cecum.
1723	0	a	PLAN: Patient was seen today by Dr. Oscar G. Gregory and Quiana N. 
1724	0	a	Bullock, NP.
1725	0	a	We will send over to her primary care physician the 
1726	0	a	operative, pathology, and discharge summaries.
1727	0	a	Shari does not need to 
1728	0	a	return to clinic unless further surgical issues arise.

1739	0	a	NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
1740	0	a	MRN:       8514931
1741	0	a	The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up.
1742	0	a	She has been having
1743	0	a	symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
1744	0	a	clear history of her symptoms.
1745	0	a	At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
1746	0	a	fall over to her right side.
1747	0	a	There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
1748	0	a	symptoms.
1749	0	a	She has not actually had syncope.
1750	0	a	There is no positional component to her
1751	0	a	I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms.
1752	0	a	The
1753	0	a	MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
1754	0	a	ovale and bilateral pontine region.
1755	0	a	She had small chronic lacunar infarcts.
1756	0	a	She reports
1757	0	a	that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
1758	0	a	would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms.
1759	0	a	She had some left internal carotid
1760	0	a	mild 30% proximal stenosis.
1761	0	a	Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.
1762	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts.
1763	27	a	Most likely related to hypertension rather
1764	0	a	than embolic disease.
1765	0	a	Her blood pressure has been very well controlled.
1766	0	a	In fact, today
1767	0	a	on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60.
1768	0	a	She brought her medications with her and
1769	41	a	has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o.
1770	33	a	q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
1771	45	a	hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o.
1772	0	a	q.d.
1773	0	a	She had not taken her medications today and
1774	0	a	her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
1775	0	a	the left.
1776	0	a	Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
1777	0	a	Her lungs are clear without
1778	0	a	wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
1779	0	a	Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
1780	0	a	S1, S2.
1781	27	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension.
1782	0	a	Now with lower blood
1783	0	a	pressure and some lightheadedness.
1784	41	a	We will d/c her atenolol.
1785	0	a	I would like her to get a
1786	0	a	repeat blood pressure in one week.
1787	0	a	I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
1788	0	a	Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
1789	14	a	diabetes.
1790	0	a	She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

2269	0	a	Dear Dr.  Osuna:
2270	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.
2271	2	a	As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.
2272	2	a	He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.
2273	33	a	His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.
2274	0	a	He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.
2275	0	a	Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.
2276	0	a	He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.
2277	0	a	He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.
2278	0	a	He is no longer using a CPAP.
2279	0	a	Current Medications:

2313	0	a	Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.
2314	0	a	concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
2315	0	a	Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.
2316	0	a	Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.
2317	9	a	Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.
2318	0	a	The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.
2319	0	a	EKG:
2320	2	a	    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.
2321	0	a	Assessment and plan:
2322	2	a	   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution.
2323	0	a	There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique.
2324	0	a	I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease.
2325	0	a	Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm.
2326	0	a	We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

2518	0	a	Dear Dr. Naranjo:
2519	79	a	We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.
2520	0	a	He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.
2521	0	a	In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.
2522	0	a	His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.
2523	0	a	Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.
2524	0	a	The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.
2525	60	a	He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.
2526	60	a	The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.
2527	49	a	He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.
2528	0	a	He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.
2529	0	a	He has had no dermatologic evaluation.
2530	0	a	He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2531	0	a	Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.
2532	0	a	Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.
2533	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.
2534	0	a	There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.
2535	0	a	Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.
2536	0	a	First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.
2537	0	a	He has an S4 at the left sternal border.
2538	0	a	The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.
2539	0	a	There is no peripheral edema.
2540	0	a	Peripheral pulses are diminished.
2541	0	a	The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.
2542	0	a	There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.
2543	38	a	Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.
2544	0	a	Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.
2545	0	a	This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.
2546	79	a	We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.
2547	79	a	We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.
2548	0	a	Sincerely,

2817	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
2818	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.
2819	31	a	Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.
2820	0	a	By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.
2821	31	a	She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.
2822	0	a	In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.
2823	0	a	Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.
2824	0	a	Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.
2825	0	a	Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.
2826	0	a	In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.
2827	0	a	Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.
2828	41	a	Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o.
2829	60	a	daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
2830	31	a	daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o.
2831	0	a	daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.
2832	0	a	b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o.
2833	37	a	b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
2834	0	a	daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o.
2835	51	a	daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.
2836	51	a	and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.
2837	0	a	Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.
2838	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.
2839	0	a	The neck is supple.
2840	0	a	JVP is flat.
2841	0	a	Carotids are without significant bruits.
2842	0	a	Chest remains clear.
2843	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.
2844	0	a	No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
2845	0	a	The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.
2846	0	a	Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.
2847	0	a	Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.
2848	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.
2849	2	a	There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
2850	0	a	Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.
2851	0	a	Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.
2852	41	a	I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o.
2853	0	a	daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.
2854	0	a	I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.
2855	0	a	She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.
2856	0	a	Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.
2857	0	a	She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.
2858	0	a	She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.
2859	0	a	In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.
2860	0	a	At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.
2861	0	a	Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.
2862	0	a	I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
2863	0	a	Sincerely yours,
2864	0	a	Brandon W Neilson, M.D.

2966	0	a	We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1.
2967	0	a	Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD.
2968	0	a	Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions.
2969	28	a	Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2.
2970	40	a	new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol.
2971	41	a	She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control.
2972	41	a	She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls.
2973	0	a	She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3.
2974	0	a	Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77).
2975	0	a	However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia.
2976	0	a	Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan.
2977	0	a	This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability.
2978	0	a	Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult.

2985	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
2986	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.
2987	0	a	While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.
2988	4	a	He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.
2989	2	a	MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.
2990	70	a	He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.
2991	2	a	After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.
2992	0	a	Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
2993	0	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
2994	70	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
2995	0	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.
2996	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
2997	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.
2998	0	a	He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.
2999	0	a	He feels well, and has had no problems.
3000	0	a	He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.
3001	0	a	He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.
3002	0	a	He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.
3003	0	a	His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.
3004	0	a	His past medical history includes:
3005	2	a	 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
3006	2	a	 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
3007	0	a	 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
3008	0	a	 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
3009	23	a	 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
3010	0	a	 hypothyroid
3011	0	a	 basal cell skin CA
3012	0	a	 nephrolithiasis
3013	0	a	His medications include:
3014	22	a	 Lipitor 80 mg
3015	70	a	 Plavix 75 mg
3016	37	a	 ASA 325 mg po QD
3017	40	a	 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
3018	0	a	 Prilosec 20 mg
3019	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
3020	23	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
3021	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.
3022	0	a	He is now back at work.
3023	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
3024	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
3025	77	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
3026	0	a	He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.
3027	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.
3028	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
3029	0	a	His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.
3030	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
3031	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
3032	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
3033	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
3034	2	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
3035	0	a	He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.
3036	0	a	His recent cardiac tests include: 
3037	0	a	 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
3038	2	a	 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 
3039	2	a	In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.
3040	0	a	He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.
3041	0	a	Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.
3042	70	a	Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.
3043	0	a	Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.
3044	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
3045	39	a	I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.
3046	0	a	We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.
3047	0	a	Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.
3048	0	a	Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.
3049	0	a	At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.
3050	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
3051	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
3052	0	a	Regards,

3344	0	a	HPI: 
3345	0	a	Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.
3346	0	a	As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.
3347	0	a	The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.
3348	0	a	Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.
3349	0	a	They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.
3350	0	a	He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.
3351	0	a	His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.
3352	0	a	His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.
3353	0	a	They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady.
3354	0	a	About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.
3355	0	a	Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.
3356	0	a	They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.
3357	0	a	Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.
3358	0	a	They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.
3359	0	a	They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.
3360	25	a	In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.

3545	0	a	     MR #045-61-32-6
3546	0	a	Dear Uddin:
3547	0	a	Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
3548	0	a	undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.
3549	0	a	His previous visit with me occurred on
3550	0	a	February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.
3551	0	a	He
3552	0	a	"denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion."
3553	0	a	This was not
3554	0	a	associated with activity.
3555	0	a	He admits to being a very sedentary person.
3556	0	a	The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
3557	0	a	LV function, and CT coronary angiography.
3558	0	a	There were no significant findings on the clinical
3559	0	a	evaluation.
3560	0	a	The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion.
3561	0	a	The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
3562	0	a	limiting stenosis.
3563	0	a	There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
3564	0	a	was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging.
3565	0	a	There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.
3566	0	a	The
3567	9	a	narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.
3568	0	a	A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
3569	0	a	cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
3570	0	a	342 mg/dl.
3571	0	a	He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.
3572	0	a	He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
3573	0	a	insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.
3574	0	a	Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.
3575	0	a	denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.
3576	0	a	His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
3577	31	a	Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily,

3581	37	a	aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.
3582	0	a	He usually takes these once every other day.

4261	0	a	RE: Lloyd Gregg 
4262	0	a	    MR#65772757
4263	0	a	Dear Xzavior, 
4264	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow
4265	0	a	up of his emphysema.
4266	0	a	The patient reports that he continues to lead a very
4267	0	a	active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours
4268	0	a	a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.
4269	0	a	When he
4270	0	a	returns home from work he cooks dinner and this
4271	0	a	combined with his work schedule and picking up his
4272	0	a	daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited
4273	0	a	him from a regular exercise program.
4274	0	a	Needless to say,
4275	0	a	he has remained active.
4276	0	a	He is not limited in these
4277	0	a	activities by his respiratory function with the
4278	0	a	exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with
4279	0	a	heavy lifting.
4280	0	a	He uses albuterol during these
4281	0	a	instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day.
4282	0	a	His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350
4283	0	a	liters per minute.
4284	0	a	He knows that when his PEFR falls
4285	0	a	to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for
4286	0	a	advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1
4287	0	a	burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.
4288	0	a	His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220
4289	0	a	micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI
4290	0	a	2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec
4291	0	a	and the albuterol as mentioned above.
4292	0	a	RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 
4293	0	a	The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of
4294	0	a	fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,
4295	0	a	change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.
4296	0	a	He does
4297	0	a	continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to
4298	0	a	frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.
4299	0	a	There is
4300	0	a	no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.
4301	0	a	On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress.
4302	0	a	NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.
4303	0	a	TM's are clear with
4304	0	a	normal light reflexes bilaterally.
4305	0	a	His nasal mucosa is notable
4306	0	a	for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.
4307	0	a	No
4308	0	a	significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary
4309	0	a	chains.
4310	0	a	Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and
4311	0	a	prolongation of his expiratory phase.
4312	0	a	He has an occasional
4313	0	a	expiratory wheeze.
4314	0	a	There are no focal findings of consolidation
4315	0	a	and air movement is moderate.
4316	0	a	No significant JVD and he has a
4317	0	a	regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and
4318	0	a	there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.
4319	0	a	Abdomen is benign without HSM,
4320	0	a	focal tenderness or masses.
4321	0	a	His extremities are without
4322	0	a	clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
4323	0	a	His weight is 223 pounds.
4324	25	a	Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his
4325	0	a	respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation
4326	0	a	of 97 percent.
4327	0	a	My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction
4328	0	a	secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.
4329	0	a	I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active
4330	0	a	life.
4331	0	a	We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of
4332	0	a	prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact
4333	0	a	information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of
4334	0	a	a flare.
4335	0	a	I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.
4336	0	a	To
4337	0	a	try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of
4338	0	a	prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun
4339	0	a	Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to
4340	0	a	be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.
4341	0	a	We talked about
4342	0	a	vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the
4343	0	a	influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia
4344	0	a	vaccine.
4345	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care.
4346	0	a	He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time
4347	0	a	but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a
4348	0	a	flare of his COPD.

4517	0	a	medicines without problems.
4518	0	a	She does note that she is having some pain 
4519	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
4520	0	a	The 
4521	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
4522	0	a	wanes over time.
4523	0	a	The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
4524	0	a	this.
4525	0	a	The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
4526	0	a	fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
4527	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
4528	0	a	walks with a walker today.
4529	25	a	Blood pressure: 144/76.
4530	0	a	Pulse: 78 and 
4531	0	a	regular.
4532	0	a	Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
4533	0	a	Her heart 
4534	0	a	is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
4535	0	a	She has got a regular rate and 
4536	0	a	rhythm today.
4537	0	a	Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
4538	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
4539	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
4540	0	a	edema.
4541	0	a	Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
4542	0	a	into the sciatic notch on the left side.
4543	0	a	She has got otherwise joints 
4544	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
4545	0	a	There 
4546	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
4547	0	a	Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
4548	0	a	monitoring.
4549	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
4550	0	a	I will 
4551	0	a	not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
4552	0	a	I 
4553	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
4554	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
4555	0	a	remits on it's own.

4558	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
4559	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
4560	0	a	She is 
4561	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
4562	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
4563	0	a	I have discussed this 
4564	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
4565	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
4566	0	a	I will talk 
4567	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
4568	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
4569	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
4570	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
4571	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
4572	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
4573	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

5067	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
5068	2	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
5069	0	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
5070	0	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
5071	27	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
5072	11	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
5073	5	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
5074	2	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
5075	0	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
5076	5	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
5077	37	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
5078	0	a	daily lifelong.
5079	0	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
5080	0	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
5081	0	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
5082	0	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
5083	0	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
5084	24	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
5085	0	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
5086	0	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
5087	77	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
5088	0	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
5089	37	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
5090	70	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
5091	59	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
5092	0	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
5093	40	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
5094	0	a	b.i.d.
5095	0	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
5096	25	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
5097	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
5098	0	a	There are no bruits.
5099	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
5100	0	a	He was not clubbed.
5101	0	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
5102	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
5103	0	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
5104	0	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
5105	0	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
5106	0	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
5107	0	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
5108	0	a	TSH was also normal.
5109	12	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
5110	20	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
5111	0	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
5112	0	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
5113	29	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
5114	29	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
5115	0	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
5116	39	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
5117	55	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
5118	37	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
5119	4	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
5120	37	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
5121	0	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
5122	0	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
5123	0	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
5124	0	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
5125	0	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
5126	0	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
5127	0	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
5128	0	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
5129	0	a	Yours sincerely,

5546	0	a	The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF.
5547	0	a	The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear.
5548	0	a	More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI.
5549	0	a	Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT.
5550	0	a	Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion.
5551	0	a	Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
5552	0	a	If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
5553	0	a	Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles.
5554	0	a	Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.
5555	68	a	Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

5847	0	a	RE:  Roberta Vincent
5848	0	a	     MR #380-18-32-2
5849	0	a	Dear Dr. Xanthos,
5850	0	a	We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
5851	0	a	the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.
5852	0	a	We will
5853	0	a	not repeat her history as you know it well.
5854	0	a	Over the past three
5855	0	a	months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
5856	0	a	occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
5857	0	a	and tingling of the fingers and toes.
5858	0	a	She has maintained a
5859	0	a	relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
5860	0	a	of breath.
5861	0	a	An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
5862	0	a	revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
5863	0	a	minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
5864	0	a	On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
5865	0	a	pounds.
5866	25	a	Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.
5867	0	a	The
5868	0	a	lungs are clear.
5869	0	a	There is no peripheral edema.
5870	0	a	Again, there marked
5871	0	a	cushingoid features.
5872	0	a	Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
5873	0	a	comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
5874	0	a	facial hair over the past several months.
5875	0	a	In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
5876	0	a	uremia.
5877	0	a	Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
5878	0	a	undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
5879	0	a	dialysis within the next several months.
5880	0	a	We have arranged to
5881	0	a	recheck her chemistries today.
5882	0	a	We would also recommend that she
5883	0	a	undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.
5884	0	a	Although renal
5885	0	a	failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
5886	0	a	androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
5887	0	a	Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

5903	14	a	HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
5904	0	a	regular follow-up.
5905	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
5906	0	a	1.
5907	14	a	Diabetes.
5908	0	a	She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
5909	0	a	     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
5910	0	a	     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.
5911	0	a	This is 
5912	0	a	     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.
5913	0	a	She 
5914	0	a	     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
5915	0	a	     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.
5916	0	a	She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
5917	0	a	     and urine dip.
5918	0	a	She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
5919	0	a	     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.
5920	0	a	She also needs 
5921	0	a	     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
5922	0	a	2.
5923	0	a	Health maintenance.
5924	0	a	Patient does not want a flu shot.
5925	0	a	Otherwise, 
5926	0	a	     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
5927	0	a	     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.
5928	0	a	We will do so.
5929	0	a	3.
5930	0	a	Migraine headaches.
5931	0	a	She said she has had one every day recently.
5932	0	a	This is worse than her usual.
5933	0	a	The Motrin was not helping.
5934	0	a	I 
5935	0	a	     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
5936	0	a	     use.
5937	0	a	Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.
5938	0	a	I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
5939	0	a	4.
5940	0	a	Ankle pain.
5941	0	a	Patient has chronic ankle pain.
5942	0	a	She went to an 
5943	0	a	     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
5944	0	a	     got better.
5945	0	a	She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
5946	0	a	     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.
5947	0	a	I therefore referred 
5948	0	a	     her at her request.

6233	0	a	Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
6234	0	a	been doing quite well.
6235	0	a	She states that she has episodes of
6236	0	a	palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
6237	0	a	minutes.
6238	0	a	She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
6239	0	a	no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
6240	0	a	She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.
6241	0	a	Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
6242	0	a	continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.
6243	0	a	states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
6244	0	a	Cessation Program.
6245	36	a	Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
6246	40	a	q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
6247	63	a	q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
6248	0	a	Protonix, and Allegra.
6249	0	a	On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress.
6250	0	a	Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
6251	0	a	beats per minute.
6252	0	a	Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
6253	0	a	edema.
6254	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
6255	0	a	JVP is 8 cm of water.
6256	0	a	Chest is clear to auscultation and
6257	0	a	percussion bilaterally.
6258	0	a	PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
6259	0	a	physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.
6260	0	a	Abdomen
6261	0	a	is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
6262	0	a	Pulse examination is
6263	0	a	normal.
6264	19	a	Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
6265	0	a	ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
6266	0	a	minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
6267	0	a	467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.
6268	0	a	There is a nonspecific Q-wave
6269	0	a	abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
6270	0	a	compared to prior.
6271	0	a	In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.
6272	0	a	Her palpitations and
6273	0	a	likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
6274	0	a	quite acceptable for her.
6275	0	a	Therefore, she wishes no consideration
6276	0	a	of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
6277	0	a	has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
6278	0	a	Regarding
6279	0	a	her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
6280	0	a	well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
6281	14	a	diabetes.
6282	0	a	However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
6283	0	a	LDL.
6284	61	a	Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
6285	0	a	to 40 mg q.h.s.
6286	0	a	I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
6287	0	a	Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
6288	0	a	cardiovascular issues.
6289	0	a	Thank you very much for referring this
6290	0	a	very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
6291	0	a	Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
6292	0	a	preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

6727	0	a	ESH #:033-98-74
6728	2	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.
6729	22	a	As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.
6730	0	a	We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.
6731	0	a	She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.
6732	0	a	She is walking each day.
6733	37	a	Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.
6734	0	a	She has no complaints of pain.
6735	0	a	She is eating well.
6736	0	a	She is sleeping well.
6737	0	a	Her incisions have healed nicely.
6738	0	a	Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.
6739	0	a	Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.
6740	0	a	I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.
6741	0	a	Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

6760	0	a	She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
6761	0	a	She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her
6762	0	a	progress.
6763	0	a	At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally 
6764	0	a	around 120/80.
6765	37	a	Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20
6766	0	a	mg.
6767	41	a	t.i.d., Labetalol 400 mg.

6776	0	a	Chest is clear.
6777	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a II/VI left sternal
6778	0	a	border systolic ejection murmur.
6779	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
6780	0	a	Extremities are free of edema.
6781	0	a	Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well.
6782	0	a	We will check her LDL
6783	0	a	again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level
6784	2	a	following her myocardial infarction.
6785	0	a	We will also check her liver
6786	0	a	function test because of her statin therapy.
6787	0	a	We may in the future
6788	0	a	need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day
6789	0	a	regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave
6790	0	a	her medications as is.
