176	0	a	76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.
177	0	a	Source of bleeding not clear.
178	0	a	Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.

180	0	a	No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.
181	40	a	Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.
182	0	a	Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.
183	0	a	EGD and colonoscopy this morning

337	0	a	ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.
338	0	a	Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.
339	0	a	Past medical records.
340	0	a	History of Present Illness  
341	17	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
342	0	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
343	0	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
344	0	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
345	0	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
346	0	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
347	0	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
348	0	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
349	0	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
350	0	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
351	0	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
352	0	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
353	0	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
354	0	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.
355	0	a	He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.
356	0	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
357	0	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
358	0	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
359	0	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
360	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
361	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
362	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
363	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
364	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
365	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
366	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
367	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
368	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
369	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
370	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
371	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
372	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
373	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).

562	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
563	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
564	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
565	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
566	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
567	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
568	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
569	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
570	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

580	0	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
581	0	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
582	5	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
583	0	a	hypoglycemia).
584	5	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
585	0	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
586	0	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
587	0	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
588	0	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
589	0	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
590	0	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
591	0	a	b.
592	0	a	Check orthostatics daily.

876	0	a	Dear Iva:
877	1	a	Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.
878	1	a	At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.
879	1	a	On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.
880	1	a	On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.
881	0	a	"She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications."
882	0	a	She has no shortness of breath.
883	0	a	She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.
884	0	a	She does get epigastric discomfort.
885	40	a	Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.
886	0	a	The review of systems is negative other than the above.
887	0	a	On physical examination, she appears well.
888	0	a	Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.
889	0	a	HEENT:  Normal.
890	0	a	The neck veins are not distended.
891	0	a	The chest is clear.
892	0	a	On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.
893	0	a	Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.
894	0	a	The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
895	0	a	The skin has no rash.
896	0	a	Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.
897	0	a	I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.
898	0	a	Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.
899	0	a	"I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck."""
900	0	a	I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.
901	0	a	I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.
902	0	a	I will plan to see her again in about four months.
903	0	a	Best personal regards.

1098	0	a	The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.
1099	0	a	I confirmed her history
1100	0	a	and physical.
1101	0	a	I also interviewed and examined the patient.
1102	0	a	Please see the note for more details.
1103	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with
1104	15	a	a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2
1105	0	a	weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with
1106	0	a	stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.
1107	0	a	The
1108	0	a	patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this
1109	0	a	ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest
1110	0	a	discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous
1111	0	a	episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with
1112	0	a	activity.
1113	65	a	He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented
1114	0	a	for further evaluation and treatment.
1115	40	a	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and
1116	0	a	Altace.
1117	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,
1118	0	a	chest pain free.
1119	0	a	Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,
1120	0	a	and O2 saturation 98% on room air.
1121	0	a	His lungs are clear to
1122	0	a	auscultation.
1123	0	a	Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
1124	0	a	Abdomen is soft
1125	0	a	and nontender.
1126	0	a	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
1127	0	a	No
1128	0	a	elevated JVP.
1129	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right
1130	0	a	bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic
1131	0	a	changes.
1132	0	a	IV access was established.
1133	0	a	Labs were sent revealing
1134	0	a	essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.
1135	0	a	Initial troponin was
1136	0	a	less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was
1137	0	a	normal.
1138	40	a	The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival.
1139	0	a	Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional
1140	0	a	beta-blockade was given to the patient.
1141	0	a	However, based on his
1142	0	a	story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given
1143	0	a	Lovenox in the emergency room.
1144	0	a	I spoke to the Cardiology B
1145	0	a	attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his
1146	0	a	service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future.
1147	0	a	With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a
1148	0	a	diagnosis of unstable angina.
1149	0	a	CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

1531	0	a	Record date: 2071-11-20
1532	0	a	Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
1533	0	a	Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D.
1534	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.
1535	0	a	HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.
1536	0	a	"The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand."
1537	0	a	This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
1538	0	a	Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
1539	0	a	He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.
1540	0	a	Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
1541	0	a	He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
1542	28	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.
1543	41	a	MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.
1544	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
1545	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.
1546	0	a	Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
1547	0	a	There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
1548	0	a	very weak opponens.
1549	0	a	He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.
1550	0	a	His interossei and extensors are full.
1551	0	a	Sensation is intact throughout.
1552	0	a	EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.
1553	0	a	IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
1554	0	a	At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
1555	0	a	Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
1556	0	a	possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
1557	0	a	We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
1558	0	a	We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
1559	0	a	We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

1571	0	a	PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
1572	0	a	Reason for visit:
1573	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
1574	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
1575	0	a	Interval History:
1576	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
1577	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
1578	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
1579	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
1580	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
1581	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
1582	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
1583	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
1584	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
1585	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
1586	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
1587	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
1588	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
1589	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
1590	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
1591	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
1592	44	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
1593	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
1594	0	a	Lasix 20mg
1595	44	a	Toprol XL 50mg
1596	40	a	ASA 325mg
1597	31	a	Zestril 20mg
1598	58	a	Lantus 10 units hs
1599	74	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
1600	0	a	Multivitamin
1601	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
1602	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
1603	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

1643	0	a	Impression:
1644	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
1645	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
1646	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
1647	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
1648	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
1649	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
1650	69	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
1651	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.

1921	0	a	Dear Dr. Mcmahon:
1922	0	a	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.
1923	22	a	He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.
1924	9	a	Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.
1925	1	a	The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.
1926	0	a	The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.
1927	0	a	There were no complications.
1928	0	a	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.
1929	0	a	His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.
1930	0	a	Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.
1931	0	a	Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.
1932	40	a	He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
1933	40	a	He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.
1934	0	a	His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.
1935	0	a	He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.
1936	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.
1937	0	a	Please call if you have questions.

2522	0	a	noted, he has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.
2523	0	a	His past 
2524	0	a	clinical course is well known to you.
2525	0	a	As you know, he had an 
2526	0	a	epicardial abscess from electrode placement.
2527	0	a	From a clinical point of view, he is otherwise stable.
2528	0	a	Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 193 pounds, blood 
2529	0	a	pressure 120/60, with a resting pulse of 76.
2530	0	a	Neck veins are distended, 
2531	0	a	with positive hepatojugular reflux.
2532	0	a	His carotid volume is diminished.
2533	0	a	His lungs are 
2534	0	a	Page Two
2535	0	a	generally clear, without rales or rhonchi.
2536	0	a	Examination of the heart 
2537	0	a	reveals a quiet precordium.
2538	0	a	There is a soft S3 gallop, no murmur of 
2539	0	a	mitral regurgitation, and no obvious murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.
2540	0	a	Abdomen is of note for a liver at the right costal margin.
2541	0	a	There is +2 
2542	0	a	peripheral edema.
2543	0	a	The resting electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm.
2544	0	a	We will be increasing his Lasix to 80 mg daily and following him 
2545	0	a	closely by telephone over the next several days.
2546	0	a	I have made no other 
2547	0	a	changes in his current medical regimen.
2548	0	a	Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.
2549	0	a	With best regards.

2958	0	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
2959	0	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
2960	0	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
2961	0	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
2962	0	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
2963	0	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
2964	0	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
2965	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
2966	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
2967	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
2968	0	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
2969	0	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
2970	0	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
2971	0	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
2972	0	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
2973	0	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
2974	0	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
2975	0	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
2976	0	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
2977	0	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
2978	0	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
2979	0	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
2980	0	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
2981	0	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
2982	0	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
2983	0	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
2984	0	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
2985	0	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
2986	0	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
2987	0	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
2988	0	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
2989	0	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
2990	0	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
2991	0	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
2992	0	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
2993	0	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
2994	0	a	He is unable to work.
2995	0	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
2996	0	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
2997	0	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
2998	0	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
2999	0	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
3000	0	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
3001	28	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
3002	68	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
3003	0	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
3004	0	a	His hair has now grown back.
3005	0	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
3006	0	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
3007	0	a	Eye contact is good.
3008	0	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
3009	0	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
3010	0	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
3011	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
3012	0	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
3013	0	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
3014	0	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
3015	0	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
3016	0	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
3017	0	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
3018	0	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
3019	0	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
3020	0	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
3021	0	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
3022	0	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
3023	0	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
3024	0	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
3025	0	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
3026	0	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
3027	0	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
3028	0	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
3029	0	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
3030	0	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
3031	0	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
3032	0	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
3033	0	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
3034	0	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
3035	0	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
3036	0	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

3844	0	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
3845	0	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
3846	0	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
3847	0	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
3848	0	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
3849	40	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

4352	0	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
4353	29	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
4354	0	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
4355	0	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
4356	0	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
4357	0	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
4358	0	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
4359	0	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
4360	0	a	Recommendations:
4361	0	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
4362	0	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
4363	40	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
4364	70	a	-Continue statin.
4365	0	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

4576	0	a	LEPROSARIUM:              962-85-18
4577	90	a	Dear Dr. Colon:
4578	0	a	I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.
4579	0	a	Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know.
4580	0	a	He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.
4581	0	a	During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.
4582	0	a	He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.
4583	0	a	He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.
4584	0	a	Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.
4585	0	a	In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.
4586	0	a	The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes.
4587	0	a	He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.
4588	0	a	He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.
4589	0	a	He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim.
4590	0	a	He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.
4591	0	a	His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.
4592	0	a	He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.
4593	0	a	On exam today he is doing quite well.
4594	0	a	He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.
4595	0	a	His head and neck exams were unremarkable.
4596	0	a	His lungs were clear.
4597	0	a	Heart was regular.
4598	0	a	His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.
4599	0	a	With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.
4600	0	a	There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity.
4601	0	a	He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.
4602	0	a	Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.
4603	0	a	He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.
4604	0	a	This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.
4605	0	a	His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.
4606	0	a	In summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.
4607	0	a	He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.
4608	0	a	Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left.
4609	0	a	With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.
4610	0	a	I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.
4611	0	a	My thanks again for this referral.
4612	0	a	I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.
4613	0	a	With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.
4614	0	a	Sincerely,

4903	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
4904	0	a	1.
4905	0	a	Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
4906	0	a	This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
4907	0	a	I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
4908	0	a	I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
4909	0	a	This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
4910	0	a	These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
4911	0	a	I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.
4912	0	a	The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.
4913	0	a	However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.
4914	0	a	I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
4915	0	a	However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.
4916	0	a	I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
4917	0	a	2.
4918	0	a	Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
4919	0	a	If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.
4920	0	a	He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
4921	0	a	The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
4922	0	a	In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.
4923	0	a	At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.
4924	0	a	At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.
4925	0	a	The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
4926	0	a	Sincerely,
4927	0	a	Gene Quadri, M.D.

4957	1	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
4958	0	a	History of Present Illness
4959	4	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
4960	1	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
4961	0	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
4962	9	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
4963	1	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
4964	9	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
4965	0	a	There was no PCI option available.
4966	0	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
4967	0	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
4968	0	a	He now presented for cath.
4969	10	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
4970	0	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
4971	0	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
4972	0	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
4973	10	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
4974	0	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
4975	0	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
4976	0	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
4977	0	a	He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

5081	17	a	History of Present Illness:  50 yo F with NIDDM, active smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and severe PVD (s/p PTCA and multiple toe amputations for diabetic foot), now presents with worsening wet gangrene.
5082	0	a	She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission.
5083	0	a	This was accompanied by toe swelling, fevers to 100.5 and chills, but she denies pain in her L great toe.
5084	0	a	Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking.
5085	0	a	She denies any trauma to her left foot.
5086	0	a	She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado.
5087	0	a	She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year.
5088	0	a	She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam.
5089	0	a	Furthermore, she underwent repeat A-LENIs that demonstrated a major decline in the ABI of her R leg, suggestive of worsening peripheral vascular disease.
5090	0	a	She is now admitted for parenteral antibiotics and amputation of the L great toe and debridement of the R forefoot ulcer.

5263	0	a	He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.
5264	42	a	This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

5514	0	a	Impression and Plan
5515	0	a	Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy.
5516	0	a	Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration.
5517	0	a	However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration.
5518	0	a	Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.
5519	0	a	I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies.
5520	45	a	Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment.
5521	0	a	For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.
5522	0	a	Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks.
5523	0	a	At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

5532	32	a	However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril.

5598	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.
5599	0	a	This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
5600	28	a	history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
5601	0	a	prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
5602	0	a	post total knee replacement.
5603	0	a	He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
5604	3	a	coronary artery disease.
5605	3	a	His history of coronary artery disease
5606	0	a	begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
5607	0	a	in June of 2091.
5608	0	a	In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
5609	0	a	and sat down.
5610	0	a	He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
5611	0	a	consciousness or edema.
5612	0	a	Workup at that time included a thallium
5613	0	a	test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
5614	0	a	echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.
5615	0	a	He began therapy
5616	40	a	at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
5617	31	a	Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.
5618	0	a	He had
5619	0	a	been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
5620	0	a	nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
5621	0	a	until this past spring.
5622	0	a	He actually had done very well with risk
5623	0	a	factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
5624	0	a	following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
5625	0	a	weight.
5626	0	a	In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
5627	0	a	up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
5628	0	a	discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.
5629	0	a	He stopped
5630	0	a	working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
5631	66	a	nitrate therapy.
5632	0	a	Since that time he has noted that he has had
5633	0	a	significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
5634	65	a	actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
5635	0	a	taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.
5636	0	a	He does note
5637	0	a	fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
5638	0	a	night.
5639	0	a	He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
5640	0	a	dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
5641	65	a	Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
5642	40	a	Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.
5643	0	a	He has no known drug
5644	0	a	allergies.
5645	0	a	On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
5646	26	a	noted to be 220/100.
5647	26	a	At the present time it is 180/100 with a
5648	0	a	Vicente, Kadeem F.
5649	0	a	MRN: 948-59-58-0
5650	0	a	Page Two
5651	0	a	heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.
5652	0	a	There is no
5653	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
5654	0	a	His carotids are free of
5655	0	a	bruits.
5656	0	a	His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
5657	0	a	and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
5658	0	a	physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.
5659	0	a	Abdominal
5660	0	a	exam is notable for a ventral hernia.
5661	0	a	There is no organomegaly and
5662	0	a	neither are there bruits present.
5663	0	a	Lower extremities are notable
5664	0	a	for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
5665	0	a	pulses with no edema.
5666	0	a	Skin exam is notable only for the senile
5667	0	a	angioma.
5668	0	a	Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
5669	0	a	is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.
5670	0	a	MIBI was
5671	0	a	notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
5672	0	a	significant ischemia on 5/6/94.
5673	0	a	The ejection fraction on a gated
5674	0	a	spect was 57%.
5675	0	a	In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
5676	0	a	myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
5677	0	a	March of 2094.
5678	0	a	He could, however, also have developed his
5679	0	a	progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
5680	0	a	his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.
5681	0	a	I will
5682	0	a	be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.
5683	0	a	In
5684	0	a	either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
5685	0	a	regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
5686	0	a	pressure.
5687	0	a	I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
5688	65	a	and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
5689	0	a	increase to 60 mg p.o.
5690	0	a	q.d.
5691	0	a	I also would consider further decrease
5692	0	a	of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
5693	0	a	assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program.
5694	0	a	Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
5695	0	a	activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route.
5696	0	a	I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
5697	0	a	hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
5698	0	a	risk factor reduction.
5699	0	a	I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you.
5700	0	a	It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
5701	0	a	Sincerely,

5807	0	a	MRN: 453-39-84-4
5808	0	a	Dear Dr.
5809	0	a	Craft:
5810	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.
5811	0	a	This lovely gentleman continues to see
5812	0	a	both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.
5813	0	a	I have discussed this with Dr.
5814	0	a	Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all
5815	0	a	would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.
5816	0	a	He notes that
5817	0	a	his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed
5818	0	a	closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium
5819	0	a	chloride doses.
5820	0	a	He has had no shortness of breath at rest.
5821	0	a	He
5822	0	a	has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema.
5823	0	a	He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
5824	0	a	His
5825	40	a	medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO
5826	31	a	b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,
5827	69	a	Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5
5828	0	a	mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d.
5829	0	a	in
5830	0	a	addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.
5831	26	a	His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right
5832	0	a	and left arm seated.
5833	0	a	After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right
5834	0	a	His heart rate is 70 and regular.
5835	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
5836	0	a	His room air saturation is 95%.
5837	0	a	lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are
5838	0	a	somewhat distant.
5839	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for
5840	0	a	nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.
5841	0	a	abdomen is soft and nontender.
5842	0	a	Extremities are notable for edema
5843	0	a	to his knees bilaterally.
5844	0	a	MRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 
5845	0	a	Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14
5846	0	a	and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.
5847	0	a	No
5848	0	a	change from prior electrocardiograms.
5849	0	a	In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing
5850	0	a	congestive heart failure.
5851	0	a	His pulmonary evaluation here was
5852	0	a	notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive
5853	0	a	pulmonary dysfunction.
5854	0	a	I would certainly concur with continued
5855	0	a	diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and
5856	0	a	creatinine.
5857	0	a	If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.

6283	0	a	Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume.

6470	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
6471	29	a	Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
6472	0	a	She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.
6473	0	a	##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
6474	0	a	Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.
6475	0	a	A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
6476	0	a	Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.
6477	0	a	Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
6478	0	a	Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.
6479	0	a	Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
6480	0	a	Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
6481	0	a	Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
6482	0	a	Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion
6483	0	a	Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
6484	0	a	##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
6485	0	a	Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.
6486	0	a	Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
6487	0	a	Check orthostatics
6488	0	a	Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.
6489	0	a	Monitor on telemetry.
6490	0	a	Physical therapy consult.
6491	0	a	##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.
6492	0	a	Fe, TIBC, ferritin
6493	0	a	Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia
6494	0	a	##: Elevated anion gap.
6495	0	a	Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.
6496	0	a	Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.
6497	0	a	There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.
6498	0	a	pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.
6499	0	a	AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).
6500	0	a	Check lactate
6501	0	a	Repeat AG
6502	0	a	##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.
6503	0	a	UA and CXR were negative.
6504	0	a	If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.
6505	0	a	Repeat CBC

6711	0	a	Dear Dr. Townsend:
6712	0	a	"	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot."
6713	15	a	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.
6714	0	a	She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.
6715	0	a	She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot.
6716	0	a	She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.
6717	0	a	Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her.
6718	0	a	She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in.
6719	0	a	Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.
6720	15	a	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
6721	40	a	Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.
6722	43	a	She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.
6723	0	a	Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.
6724	0	a	She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.
6725	0	a	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.
6726	0	a	She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.
6727	0	a	She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely.
6728	0	a	She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
6729	0	a	The skin is of normal turgor.
6730	0	a	She has no active plantar ulcers on

6733	0	a	Date: February 17, 2100
6734	0	a	either foot.
6735	0	a	At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.
6736	0	a	No new x-rays were obtained today.
6737	0	a	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.
6738	0	a	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.
6739	0	a	It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.
6740	0	a	I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.
6741	0	a	I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.
6742	0	a	We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer.
6743	0	a	She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime.
6744	0	a	Thank you kindly for this referral.

7929	0	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.

7931	28	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
7932	0	a	Will discuss with Drs.
7933	0	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
7934	0	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
7935	0	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
7936	0	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
7937	0	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
7938	0	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
7939	17	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
7940	0	a	Follow sugars while in house
7941	0	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

7955	0	a	Dear Quin,
7956	0	a	Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.
7957	28	a	As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083.
7958	0	a	She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.
7959	0	a	She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.
7960	0	a	An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.
7961	0	a	Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.
7962	0	a	At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.
7963	86	a	Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.
7964	0	a	Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.
7965	0	a	There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
7966	0	a	After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.
7967	0	a	"She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s."
7968	0	a	She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.
7969	78	a	She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.
7970	0	a	It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.
7971	0	a	A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.
7972	0	a	With best regards.
7973	0	a	Sincerely yours,

8777	0	a	Dear Fitzgerald:
8778	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.
8779	4	a	As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.
8780	9	a	At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.
8781	0	a	The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.
8782	4	a	The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.
8783	0	a	There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.
8784	3	a	He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
8785	0	a	At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.
8786	0	a	That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.
8787	0	a	The right side was patent.
8788	0	a	With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.
8789	0	a	The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.
8790	0	a	The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.
8791	0	a	Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.
8792	0	a	There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
8793	0	a	The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.
8794	0	a	He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.
8795	0	a	The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
8796	0	a	He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
8797	0	a	Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.
8798	0	a	This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
8799	0	a	The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
8800	0	a	He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.
8801	0	a	Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.
8802	0	a	He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.
8803	0	a	He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.
8804	0	a	The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
8805	0	a	His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
8806	0	a	He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
8807	0	a	He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.
8808	0	a	Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.
8809	0	a	He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
8810	0	a	He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.
8811	0	a	Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.
8812	0	a	"Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
8813	0	a	At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.

8887	0	a	Other Data:
8888	0	a	   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
8889	0	a	Assessment and plan:
8890	0	a	   1.
8891	0	a	Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.
8892	0	a	This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
8893	0	a	I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.
8894	0	a	Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
8895	0	a	We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
8896	0	a	I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.
8897	0	a	Impression:
8898	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.
8899	0	a	We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.
8900	0	a	Right leg has not been examined in the past.
8901	0	a	Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.
8902	0	a	Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
8903	0	a	Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
8904	0	a	Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
8905	0	a	If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.
8906	0	a	He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.
8907	4	a	Coronary artery disease - stable.
8908	17	a	Diabetes.
8909	0	a	Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

8937	0	a	Dear Dr. Ventura:
8938	0	a	Peggy Tinsley was seen in the Renal Clinic today.
8939	0	a	Her chief
8940	0	a	symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved
8941	0	a	much with Benadryl.
8942	0	a	She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna
8943	0	a	lotion.
8944	0	a	Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in
8945	0	a	samples for cultures today.
8946	0	a	Her appetite has improved somewhat.
8947	0	a	She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.
8948	0	a	Medications
8949	32	a	include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg
8950	42	a	b.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.
8951	0	a	On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.
8952	0	a	Heart rate
8953	0	a	was 72, blood pressure 130/64.
8954	0	a	JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm
8955	0	a	greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral
8956	0	a	edema.
8957	0	a	There was no S3.
8958	0	a	Chest examination revealed bibasilar
8959	0	a	inspiratory crackles.
8960	0	a	Her left hand is no longer cold, but the
8961	0	a	PTFE graft remains slightly edematous.
8962	0	a	Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,
8963	0	a	bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate
8964	0	a	5.2, albumin 3.4.
8965	0	a	We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's
8966	0	a	PTFE graft is suitable.
8967	0	a	This will save her the additional
8968	0	a	morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.
8969	0	a	She is more hypervolemic
8970	0	a	than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her
8971	0	a	diuretic regimen.
8972	0	a	By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,
8973	0	a	and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o.
8974	0	a	q.d., and
8975	0	a	Nephrocaps 1 p.o.

9427	0	a	Mr. Vieira presented to Dr. Atwood clinic 
9428	0	a	today with persistent wound collection in the below knee popliteal incision.
9429	0	a	He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago, underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics.
9430	0	a	This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid, apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released.
9431	0	a	He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing, replacing the wick, and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this.
9432	0	a	We will see him again in another week.

9712	0	a	   Ms. Kong presents to follow-up her recent hospitalizations.
9713	0	a	Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI.
9714	0	a	The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.
9715	0	a	Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.
9716	0	a	On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.
9717	0	a	Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA.
9718	0	a	Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.
9719	0	a	She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.
9720	0	a	However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest.
9721	0	a	ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).
9722	0	a	TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.
9723	0	a	There was a new apical WMA.
9724	0	a	She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.
9725	0	a	The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (?
9726	0	a	from afib, INR 1.5 on admission).
9727	0	a	She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.
9728	0	a	She was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.
9729	0	a	She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.
9730	0	a	She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.
9731	0	a	However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits.
9732	0	a	No F/C or weight loss.
9733	0	a	She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.
9734	0	a	While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat.
9735	0	a	Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.
9736	0	a	However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week.
9737	0	a	She denies LE edema.

9790	0	a	"	Impression:"
9791	0	a	   Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months.
9792	0	a	Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning.
9793	0	a	To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home).
9794	0	a	She has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.
9795	0	a	If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix.
9796	0	a	In terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced.
9797	0	a	She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.
9798	0	a	In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement.
9799	0	a	She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.
9800	0	a	With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced.
9801	0	a	If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run.
9802	0	a	She'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.
9803	0	a	Seen with Dr. Richard Oden.

10191	0	a	ASSESSMENT
10192	29	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
10193	0	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
10194	0	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
10195	0	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
10196	0	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
10197	0	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
10198	0	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
10199	31	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
10200	0	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
10201	0	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
10202	22	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
10203	0	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
10204	0	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
10205	0	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
10206	0	a	PLAN
10207	0	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
10208	0	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
10209	0	a	-D/c naproxen use.
10210	0	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
10211	0	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
10212	0	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
10213	17	a	#) DM
10214	61	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

10409	0	a	Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant.
10410	0	a	Rule out 
10411	0	a	osteoporosis.
10412	0	a	HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
10413	0	a	diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.
10414	0	a	At 
10415	0	a	the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
10416	0	a	Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
10417	0	a	but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
10418	0	a	approximately 26 weeks.
10419	0	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
10420	0	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
10421	15	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
10422	0	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
10423	0	a	Subsequently he 
10424	0	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
10425	57	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
10426	57	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.
10427	0	a	He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
10428	0	a	100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
10429	0	a	Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.
10430	0	a	The patient's 
10431	15	a	complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.
10432	0	a	There is 
10433	0	a	no peripheral neuropathy.
10434	0	a	There is no autonomic neuropathy.
10435	0	a	No retinal 
10436	0	a	disease.
10437	0	a	However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
10438	0	a	creatinine currently of 2.4.
10439	0	a	Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
10440	0	a	symptoms in the early 80s.
10441	0	a	By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
10442	0	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
10443	0	a	2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
10444	0	a	infarctions.
10445	0	a	In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
10446	0	a	transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.
10447	0	a	Since 
10448	0	a	that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
10449	0	a	with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
10450	0	a	degree of symptoms.
10451	0	a	The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
10452	0	a	day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.
10453	0	a	Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
10454	39	a	twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
10455	0	a	mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.
10456	0	a	Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
10457	0	a	was from a trauma some years ago.
10458	0	a	Other past medical history includes

10546	0	a	Page 3
10547	0	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
10548	0	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
10549	0	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
10550	0	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
10551	0	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
10552	0	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
10553	0	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
10554	0	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
10555	0	a	patients.
10556	0	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
10557	0	a	this makes sense.
10558	0	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
10559	0	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
10560	0	a	reasons.
10561	0	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
10562	0	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
10563	0	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
10564	0	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
10565	0	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
10566	0	a	We would be a little 
10567	0	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
10568	0	a	without more information about this patient.
10569	15	a	The patient's diabetes 
10570	0	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
10571	0	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
10572	0	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
10573	0	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
10574	0	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
10575	0	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
10576	0	a	situation.
10577	0	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

10934	0	a	1.
10935	0	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
10936	0	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
10937	0	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
10938	0	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
10939	0	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
10940	0	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
10941	0	a	2.
10942	0	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
10943	0	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
10944	0	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
10945	0	a	3.
10946	0	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
10947	0	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
10948	0	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
10949	0	a	4.
10950	0	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
10951	0	a	5.
10952	0	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
10953	0	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

10958	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
10959	0	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
10960	0	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
10961	0	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
10962	0	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
10963	0	a	His options are:
10964	0	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
10965	0	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
10966	0	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
10967	0	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

11113	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
11114	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.
11115	0	a	Currently, she complains of
11116	0	a	exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral
11117	0	a	edema.
11118	0	a	Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite
11119	0	a	difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing
11120	84	a	members of our obesity clinic.
11121	0	a	As you know, in the past, she
11122	0	a	also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or
11123	0	a	other invasive studies.
11124	0	a	Presently, she remains on a regimen of
11125	40	a	enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
11126	69	a	q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
11127	44	a	q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
11128	65	a	b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.
11129	35	a	q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o.
11130	76	a	q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o.
11131	0	a	q.d., potassium,
11132	0	a	10 mEq p.o.
11133	0	a	q.d.
11134	0	a	Pumex 2 mg p.o.
11135	0	a	q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,
11136	59	a	Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units
11137	59	a	subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.
11138	0	a	Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no
11139	0	a	acute distress.
11140	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,
11141	0	a	heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and
11142	0	a	unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10
11143	0	a	months ago.
11144	0	a	The neck is soft.
11145	0	a	JVP is flat.
11146	0	a	Carotids without
11147	0	a	significant bruits.
11148	0	a	Chest is clear.
11149	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a
11150	0	a	normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic
11151	0	a	murmur radiating from apex to the base.
11152	0	a	No significant diastolic
11153	0	a	murmur or rub.
11154	0	a	The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.
11155	0	a	Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are
11156	0	a	intact albeit mildly diminished.
11157	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS
11158	0	a	response.
11159	0	a	The P waves are more organized than one might usually
11160	0	a	see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well.
11161	0	a	QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior
11162	1	a	inferior myocardial infarction.
11163	0	a	Compared with his last
11164	0	a	electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.
11165	84	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,
11166	0	a	and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding
11167	0	a	the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh
11168	0	a	reduction program.
11169	0	a	I once again have strongly encouraged her to
11170	84	a	make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in
11171	0	a	extensive weight reduction.
11172	0	a	I also discussed with her my
11173	0	a	concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral
11174	0	a	edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial
11175	0	a	or tachyarrhythmias.
11176	0	a	As in the past, she told me that she would
11177	0	a	refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other
11178	0	a	studies.
11179	0	a	She did, however, agree to continue with her current
11180	0	a	medical regimen.
11181	0	a	I obtained routine blood studies today to
11182	0	a	verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.
11183	0	a	I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who
11184	0	a	will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he
11185	0	a	next few weeks.
11186	0	a	We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn
11187	0	a	to begin at 2.5 mg p.o.
11188	0	a	q.d., which will help result in some
11189	0	a	degree of mild diuresis.
11190	0	a	Nonetheless, she understands that
11191	0	a	significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction
11192	0	a	program.
11193	0	a	I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac
11194	0	a	morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.
11195	0	a	Beyond this, I
11196	0	a	have not altered her current medical regimen.
11197	0	a	Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.
11198	0	a	Sincerely yours,

11327	0	a	Reason for Visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
11328	0	a	Stage IVB 
11329	0	a	Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 
11330	0	a	Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 
11331	0	a	History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.
11332	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
11333	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
11334	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
11335	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
11336	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
11337	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
11338	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
11339	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
11340	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
11341	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
11342	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
11343	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
11344	0	a	He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.
11345	0	a	Problems/PMH:

11399	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
11400	0	a	72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer.
11401	0	a	He is doing quite well.
11402	0	a	Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss.
11403	0	a	After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging.
11404	0	a	If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment.
11405	0	a	If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards.
11406	0	a	He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.
11407	0	a	RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

11420	0	a	DOB: 07/30/2063
11421	0	a	Dear Dr. Rucker, 
11422	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Val in the office today.
11423	0	a	As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia.
11424	0	a	He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years.
11425	0	a	He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain.
11426	0	a	He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain.
11427	0	a	Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable.
11428	0	a	He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate.
11429	15	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma.
11430	73	a	MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin.
11431	0	a	ALLERGIES: None.
11432	0	a	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy.
11433	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.
11434	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory.
11435	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain.
11436	0	a	His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal.
11437	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia.
11438	0	a	The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging.
11439	0	a	I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression.
11440	0	a	He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression.
11441	0	a	I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered.
11442	0	a	A surgical consent was obtained.
11443	0	a	The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135.
11444	0	a	Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy.
11445	0	a	I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

11544	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
11545	28	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
11546	0	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
11547	0	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
11548	0	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
11549	0	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
11550	0	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
11551	0	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
11552	84	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
11553	0	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
11554	28	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
11555	0	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
11556	0	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
11557	28	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.

11565	0	a	daily.
11566	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
11567	89	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
11568	0	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
11569	0	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
11570	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
11571	26	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
11572	84	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
11573	0	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
11574	0	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
11575	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
11576	84	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
11577	0	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
11578	0	a	He has good distal pulsations.
11579	0	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
11580	0	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
11581	0	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
11582	0	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
11583	0	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
11584	84	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
11585	28	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
11586	0	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
11587	0	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
11588	0	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
11589	28	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
11590	0	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
11591	0	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
11592	0	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
11593	0	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
11594	44	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
11595	0	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
11596	0	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
11597	0	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
11598	17	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
11599	11	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
11600	0	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
11601	28	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
11602	28	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
11603	0	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
11604	0	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
11605	0	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
11606	0	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
11607	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
11608	0	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
11609	0	a	Thank you.
11610	0	a	Sincerely,

12867	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
12868	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
12869	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
12870	29	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
12871	0	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
12872	0	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
12873	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
12874	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
12875	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
12876	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
12877	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
12878	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
12879	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

12925	0	a	Tandem gait intact.
12926	0	a	Romberg negative.
12927	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
12928	29	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
12929	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
12930	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
12931	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
12932	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
12933	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
12934	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
12935	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
12936	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
12937	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
12938	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
12939	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
12940	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
12941	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
12942	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
12943	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
12944	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
12945	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

13899	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
13900	28	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.
13901	0	a	Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.
13902	0	a	She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.
13903	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.
13904	40	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o.
13905	0	a	q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o.
13906	72	a	q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o.
13907	35	a	q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o.
13908	44	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o.
13909	69	a	q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o.
13910	75	a	q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.
13911	26	a	Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.
13912	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the exam table.
13913	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.
13914	0	a	There are very rare crackles at the bases.
13915	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.
13916	0	a	P2 is increased.
13917	0	a	There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.
13918	0	a	She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.
13919	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.
13920	0	a	There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.
13921	0	a	In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.
13922	0	a	She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.
13923	28	a	In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o.
13924	0	a	q.d.
13925	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.
13926	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.
13927	0	a	It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.
13928	0	a	Sincerely yours,

14302	0	a	spots floating in his visual field.
14303	0	a	He has been noting some
14304	0	a	decreased depth perception and visual acuity.
14305	0	a	At the same time,
14306	0	a	he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he
14307	0	a	believes were migraines.
14308	0	a	He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.

14313	0	a	Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I
14314	0	a	had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

14361	17	a	Diabetes.
14362	0	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
14363	0	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
14364	17	a	diabetes.
14365	0	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

14375	30	a	He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.
14376	0	a	He is asked
14377	0	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
14378	0	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens

14380	0	a	I assume that this
14381	0	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.
14382	0	a	was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job
14383	0	a	until his symptoms clear.
14384	0	a	2.

14976	0	a	Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
14977	0	a	     MR #401-10-87-8
14978	0	a	Dear Jac:
14979	0	a	I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology office today
14980	0	a	and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular
14981	0	a	perspective.
14982	0	a	Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
14983	0	a	undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps.
14984	0	a	Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.
14985	0	a	This has been
14986	0	a	reevaluated and he has been stable.
14987	0	a	The fourth polyp will need to
14988	0	a	be removed at a later time.
14989	40	a	At this point, his aspirin has been
14990	0	a	discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
14991	0	a	discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests.
14992	0	a	His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,
14993	46	a	Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.
14994	0	a	He is aware of a
14995	0	a	belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
14996	0	a	exertional or other related symptoms.
14997	0	a	He is reasonably active but
14998	0	a	somewhat limited by his claudication.
14999	0	a	On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,
15000	0	a	a heart rate of 65 and regular.
15001	0	a	Head and neck were unremarkable.
15002	0	a	Chest is clear.
15003	0	a	Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
15004	0	a	at 30 degrees.
15005	0	a	PMI is normal.
15006	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a
15007	0	a	physiologic split.
15008	0	a	There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
15009	0	a	murmur at the left sternal border.
15010	0	a	Abdominal exam was
15011	0	a	unremarkable.
15012	0	a	Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
15013	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
15014	0	a	rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
15015	0	a	intraventricular conduction delay.
15016	0	a	Page 2
15017	0	a	I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.
15018	0	a	It would be of
15019	0	a	value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
15020	0	a	2069.
15021	0	a	He had minimal ischemia at that time.
15022	0	a	There are no symptoms
15023	0	a	that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
15024	0	a	see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings.
15025	0	a	If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me.
15026	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
15027	0	a	Kindest personal regards.
15028	0	a	Sincerely yours,

15049	0	a	He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot.
15050	0	a	He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09/84 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off.
15051	0	a	His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years.
15052	9	a	He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory.
15053	0	a	His LV was normal with EF of 59%.
15054	0	a	He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis.
15055	0	a	There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX.
15056	0	a	He had been asymptomatic.
15057	0	a	The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty.
15058	1	a	There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall.
15059	0	a	He tolerated this well.

15484	0	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.
15485	0	a	Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.
15486	0	a	Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.
15487	0	a	Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
15488	0	a	Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
15489	0	a	Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
15490	0	a	Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
15491	17	a	DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
15492	24	a	Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
15493	0	a	Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
15494	0	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
15495	0	a	Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.
15496	0	a	11.
15497	0	a	Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

15666	0	a	RE:  Edwin Workman
15667	0	a	     MR #612-48-04-0
15668	0	a	Dear Dr. Paz:
15669	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today.
15670	0	a	Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective.
15671	0	a	Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing
15672	0	a	well.
15673	0	a	His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,
15674	45	a	prednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,
15675	40	a	Cardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,
15676	70	a	pravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and
15677	57	a	vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32
15678	57	a	units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.
15679	0	a	On physical examination, he was obese.
15680	26	a	Blood pressure of 150/90
15681	0	a	with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
15682	0	a	5 pounds from September 21st.
15683	0	a	Chest was clear to auscultation and
15684	0	a	percussion.
15685	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-
15686	0	a	displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
15687	0	a	gallops.
15688	0	a	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
15689	0	a	His abdomen
15690	0	a	is obese, soft and nontender.
15691	0	a	It is difficult to appreciate any
15692	0	a	organomegaly.
15693	0	a	There is no hepatojugular reflux.
15694	0	a	Extremities are
15695	0	a	without edema.
15696	0	a	Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85.
15697	0	a	Intervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.
15698	0	a	This is a
15699	0	a	normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.
15700	0	a	Therefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular
15701	0	a	perspective.
15702	0	a	We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
15703	0	a	regimen according to his laboratory results.
15704	0	a	Unfortunately, he did
15705	0	a	take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his
15706	0	a	labs back to us.
15707	0	a	I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion
15708	0	a	control.
15709	0	a	I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals
15710	0	a	such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130.
15711	0	a	Workman, Edwin
15712	0	a	MR #612-48-04-0                    -2-            October 17, 2085
15713	0	a	Mr. Workman will return in January for a biopsy and clinic visit.

15808	0	a	continue her salt-restricted diet.
15809	0	a	We also discussed that she continue 
15810	0	a	her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
15811	0	a	the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.
15812	0	a	She currently 
15813	0	a	weighs 199 lbs.
15814	0	a	"and stands approximately 4'9"" tall."
15815	0	a	As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
15816	0	a	pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
15817	46	a	time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
15818	0	a	XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
15819	0	a	gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.
15820	0	a	However, at 
15821	0	a	this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
15822	0	a	and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
15823	0	a	pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
15824	25	a	200s-190s.
15825	0	a	Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
15826	0	a	now appears to be much more stable.
15827	0	a	She is currently living with her 
15828	0	a	mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
15829	0	a	about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.
15830	26	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.
15831	0	a	Heart: RRR, no 
15832	0	a	murmurs.
15833	85	a	Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
15834	0	a	tenderness.
15835	0	a	She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
15836	0	a	swelling bilaterally at the ankles.
15837	0	a	Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
15838	0	a	or lumps.
15839	0	a	She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
15840	0	a	mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
15841	0	a	guaiacs.
15842	0	a	Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
15843	0	a	issue at this point.

16041	0	a	Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
16042	0	a	Background:
16043	28	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
16044	0	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
16045	0	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
16046	0	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
16047	0	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
16048	0	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
16049	1	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
16050	0	a	Slowly these lesions healed.
16051	0	a	Interim Issues:
16052	28	a	The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
16053	5	a	But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
16054	1	a	In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
16055	0	a	Recovering from surgery has been slow.
16056	0	a	But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
16057	0	a	She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home.
16058	0	a	She has had no recurrent chest pain.
16059	0	a	She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
16060	0	a	She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se.
16061	0	a	She healed well postoperatively.
16062	0	a	She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
16063	0	a	Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
16064	0	a	In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's.
16065	0	a	She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
16066	0	a	What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
16067	0	a	She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
16068	0	a	She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
16069	0	a	She has had no worsening swallowing.
16070	0	a	She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
16071	0	a	She sleeps on two pillows.
16072	0	a	She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
16073	0	a	She continues on omeprazole.
16074	0	a	Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.

16100	0	a	Her color is good and she smiles easily.
16101	0	a	She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes.
16102	0	a	Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here.
16103	0	a	Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well.

16159	0	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
16160	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.
16161	0	a	VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.
16162	0	a	Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous.
16163	0	a	For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.
16164	0	a	The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.
16165	0	a	He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.
16166	0	a	He has managed to lose 6 lbs.
16167	0	a	by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.
16168	0	a	GE reflux is very well controlled.
16169	40	a	Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.
16170	0	a	On Examination:  He is well appearing.
16171	0	a	Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.
16172	0	a	Oropharynx is clear.
16173	0	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
16174	0	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter.
16175	0	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.
16176	0	a	Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.
16177	85	a	Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
16178	0	a	Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis.
16179	0	a	Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.
16180	0	a	Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.
16181	0	a	Weight is 238 lbs.
16182	82	a	(BMI 38).
16183	0	a	Impression:
16184	0	a	1.
16185	0	a	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.
16186	0	a	I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.
16187	0	a	I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.
16188	0	a	I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.
16189	0	a	If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.
16190	84	a	The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.
16191	0	a	I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs.
16192	0	a	to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.
16193	0	a	Hence, he has his work cut out for him.
16194	0	a	2.
16195	83	a	Obesity - As above.
16196	0	a	3.
16197	15	a	Diabetes.
16198	0	a	4.
16199	0	a	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.
16200	0	a	5.
16201	0	a	GE reflux - As mentioned.
16202	0	a	6.
16203	0	a	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.
16204	0	a	Recommendations:
16205	0	a	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.
16206	0	a	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d.
16207	0	a	- as 20 mg b.i.d.
16208	0	a	did not give full control with the generic pills.
16209	0	a	We will review pathology.
16210	0	a	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.
16211	0	a	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.
16212	0	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
16213	0	a	Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.
16214	0	a	Sincerely,

16225	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4
16226	0	a	Dear Usha:
16227	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in
16228	0	a	my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary
16229	0	a	artery bypass surgery.
16230	0	a	As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a
16231	0	a	terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest
16232	0	a	discomfort.
16233	0	a	One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was
16234	0	a	fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.
16235	0	a	Both of
16236	65	a	these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.
16237	0	a	I
16238	0	a	am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier
16239	0	a	Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her
16240	65	a	test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.
16241	0	a	Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.
16242	0	a	She
16243	0	a	continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking
16244	0	a	corticosteroid shots for that.
16245	0	a	On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly
16246	0	a	woman.
16247	26	a	Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.
16248	0	a	Jugular venous
16249	0	a	pulse is not observed.
16250	0	a	She has bilateral carotid bruits.
16251	0	a	Chest
16252	0	a	exam is clear.
16253	0	a	Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a
16254	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
16255	0	a	sternal border.
16256	0	a	Abdominal exam is benign.
16257	0	a	Peripheral exam shows
16258	0	a	trace pedal edema.
16259	0	a	EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute.
16260	0	a	There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old
16261	0	a	anterolateral MI.
16262	0	a	The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared
16263	0	a	with previous tracings.
16264	0	a	MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085
16265	0	a	IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a
16266	0	a	Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.
16267	0	a	If she can
16268	0	a	exercise on this test, that would be even better.
16269	0	a	When the
16270	0	a	results are back, I will get back you regarding further
16271	0	a	recommendations.
16272	0	a	My hope is that we will not have to
16273	0	a	revascularize her again.
16274	0	a	If we do, I am hoping to do so with
16275	0	a	potential angioplasty and stenting.
16276	0	a	In the meantime, I have
16277	69	a	switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes
16278	0	a	of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100.
16279	20	a	Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.
16280	0	a	I also suggested to her in
16281	0	a	the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know
16282	0	a	the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of
16283	0	a	her steroid injection for her back.
16284	0	a	Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
16285	0	a	regarding this patient.
16286	0	a	Again, thank you for referring her to
16287	0	a	our clinic.

16302	0	a	Dear Dr. Yuan:
16303	3	a	I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.
16304	0	a	I will be sending a copy of this letter to
16305	0	a	Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
16306	3	a	Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
16307	15	a	He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
16308	57	a	About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.
16309	0	a	His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.
16310	57	a	His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..
16311	70	a	He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
16312	28	a	His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.
16313	32	a	He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
16314	70	a	He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
16315	84	a	He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.
16316	0	a	He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.
16317	0	a	His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.
16318	0	a	His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.
16319	0	a	He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.
16320	0	a	Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
16321	0	a	The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
16322	0	a	The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.
16323	0	a	The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
16324	0	a	His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.
16325	0	a	He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
16326	0	a	He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
16327	0	a	Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
16328	0	a	He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.
16329	0	a	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
16330	0	a	He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
16331	0	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
16332	84	a	On exam, he is obese but comfortable.
16333	26	a	Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.
16334	0	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
16335	0	a	Chest is clear.
16336	0	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
16337	0	a	PMI is normal.
16338	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
16339	0	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
16340	0	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
16341	84	a	The abdomen is obese.
16342	0	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
16343	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
16344	0	a	Distal pulses are normal.
16345	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.
16346	0	a	He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
16347	0	a	The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
16348	3	a	Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
16349	0	a	This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
16350	0	a	We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
16351	0	a	In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.
16352	0	a	He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
16353	0	a	I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.
16354	0	a	We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
16355	0	a	I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
16356	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
16357	0	a	We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
16358	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
16359	0	a	Kindest personal regards.

17170	0	a	MRN:     8514931
17171	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian
17172	0	a	female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness.
17173	0	a	Her daughter,
17174	0	a	who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today.
17175	0	a	Apparently, for
17176	0	a	"many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled"""
17177	0	a	when she walks.
17178	0	a	This never occurs when lying down or sitting.
17179	0	a	It is only when she is
17180	0	a	walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or
17181	0	a	backward.
17182	0	a	At times, she does visibly veer when she walks.
17183	0	a	She has had one fall a
17184	0	a	number of months ago when she broke her wrist.
17185	0	a	She has not had any subsequent
17186	0	a	falls.
17187	0	a	There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,
17188	0	a	numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache.
17189	0	a	She actually
17190	0	a	feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it
17191	0	a	was a little more severe.
17192	0	a	Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.
17193	0	a	Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.
17194	0	a	Review of other systems notable for general fatigue.
17195	0	a	Otherwise unremarkable.
17196	0	a	No
17197	0	a	chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
17198	15	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

17200	48	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,
17201	54	a	Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx.
17202	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.
17203	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece.
17204	0	a	She neither drinks nor
17205	0	a	smokes.
17206	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,
17207	0	a	72-year-old female.
17208	26	a	BP 140/84.
17209	0	a	Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,
17210	0	a	except for decreased hearing on the left.
17211	0	a	On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift.
17212	0	a	Good
17213	0	a	power throughout upper and lower extremities.
17214	0	a	She does, however, seem mildly
17215	0	a	bradykinetic diffusely.
17216	0	a	Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric.
17217	0	a	Amplitude
17218	0	a	is normal for finger tapping.

17223	0	a	Foot-tapping decreased
17224	0	a	bilaterally.
17225	0	a	Romberg sway.
17226	0	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to
17227	0	a	either side.
17228	0	a	She is unable to perform tandem.
17229	0	a	DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+
17230	0	a	ankle jerks.
17231	0	a	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
17232	0	a	DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter
17233	0	a	hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral
17234	0	a	pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right
17235	0	a	internal capsule and bilateral thalami.
17236	0	a	Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the
17237	0	a	anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the
17238	0	a	posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment
17239	0	a	stenosis of the basilar artery.
17240	0	a	Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134.
17241	0	a	8/30
17242	0	a	bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits.
17243	0	a	LFT's normal except SGOT
17244	0	a	elevated at 46.
17245	15	a	IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and
17246	28	a	hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady.
17247	0	a	She is
17248	0	a	symptomatic only when she walks.
17249	0	a	Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
17250	0	a	toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the
17251	0	a	wide-based, at times veering gait.
17252	0	a	It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are
17253	0	a	multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.
17254	0	a	It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given
17255	0	a	that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she
17256	0	a	is concerned about.
17257	0	a	However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,
17258	0	a	she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she
17259	0	a	became hypotensive.
17260	0	a	As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding
17261	39	a	Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she
17262	0	a	can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine.
17263	0	a	I will see her in follow up in two
17264	0	a	months to see how she is doing.
17265	0	a	May also consider checking CBC, given her
17266	0	a	symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

17419	0	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
17420	0	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
17421	0	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
17422	0	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
17423	0	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
17424	0	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
17425	0	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
17426	0	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
17427	0	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
17428	0	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
17429	0	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
17430	0	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
17431	28	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
17432	40	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
17433	0	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
17434	0	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
17435	89	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
17436	23	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
17437	83	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
17438	0	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
17439	0	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
17440	0	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
17441	0	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
17442	0	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
17443	0	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
17444	0	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
17445	0	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
17446	0	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
17447	0	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
17448	0	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
17449	0	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
17450	0	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
17451	0	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
17452	0	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
17453	0	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
17454	0	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
17455	0	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
17456	83	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
17457	0	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
17458	0	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
17459	0	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
17460	84	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
17461	0	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
17462	0	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
17463	0	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
17464	0	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
17465	0	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
17466	0	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
17467	0	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
17468	0	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
17469	0	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
17470	0	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
17471	0	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
17472	0	a	Sincerely,
17473	0	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

18431	0	a	The aortic valve is tricuspid.
18432	0	a	There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler.
18433	0	a	LEFT VENTRICLE 
18434	0	a	The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
18435	0	a	The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.
18436	0	a	There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.
18437	0	a	There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant.
18438	0	a	The estimated ejection fraction is 65 %.
18439	0	a	TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
18440	0	a	There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency.
18441	0	a	PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.
18442	0	a	There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler.
18443	0	a	The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg).
18444	0	a	The estimated RV systolic pressure is 33 mmHg.
18445	0	a	RIGHT VENTRICLE 
18446	0	a	The right ventricle is not dilated.
18447	0	a	The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.
18448	0	a	INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
18449	0	a	There are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device.
18450	0	a	The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device.

18452	0	a	PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
18453	0	a	There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
18454	0	a	CONCLUSIONS 
18455	0	a	Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever.
18456	0	a	Assessment and plan:
18457	0	a	   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.
18458	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
18459	0	a	Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.
18460	43	a	We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.
18461	44	a	If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.
18462	40	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

18475	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male
18476	0	a	with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
18477	3	a	history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and
18478	0	a	DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently
18479	0	a	missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal
18480	0	a	girth and shortness of breath.
18481	0	a	He said that his father has been
18482	0	a	sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time
18483	0	a	helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday
18484	0	a	and missed his Friday dialysis run.
18485	0	a	Today is Sunday and he
18486	0	a	generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.
18487	0	a	When I asked if he
18488	0	a	has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,
18489	0	a	but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and
18490	0	a	was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the
18491	0	a	pain.
18492	0	a	Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain
18493	0	a	when he was exerting himself.
18494	0	a	He does feel slightly increased
18495	0	a	shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks
18496	0	a	that because of increased fluids.
18497	0	a	He has had no fevers or

18533	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which
18534	0	a	showed normal sinus rhythm.
18535	0	a	No significant ST or T
18536	0	a	abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with

18538	0	a	PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of
18539	0	a	acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.
18540	0	a	Only labs which resulted
18541	0	a	initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets
18542	0	a	423,000 and white count of 6.74.
18543	0	a	We made contact with the renal
18544	0	a	fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the
18545	0	a	dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this
18546	0	a	patient.
18547	0	a	His potassium was not back at the time that he left the
18548	0	a	department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias
18549	0	a	on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is
18550	0	a	very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess
18551	0	a	when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure
18552	0	a	that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.
18553	0	a	After he
18554	0	a	left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1
18555	0	a	and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a
18556	0	a	chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,
18557	0	a	glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium
18558	0	a	8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called
18559	0	a	the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have
18560	0	a	the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to
18561	0	a	treat him there acutely.
18562	0	a	Again after the dialysis, the patient
18563	0	a	will return to the Emergency Department.
18564	0	a	We will reassess if
18565	0	a	symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes.
18566	0	a	If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no
18567	0	a	chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for
18568	0	a	acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not
18569	0	a	acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he
18570	0	a	will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis
18571	0	a	schedule.
18572	0	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.
18573	0	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
18574	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Pending.

18588	0	a	Resident's
18589	0	a	note was reviewed.
18590	0	a	The patient was seen and examined by me, and
18591	0	a	I confirm the resident's findings.
18592	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a
18593	0	a	46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,
18594	15	a	diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.
18595	0	a	She is also dialysis
18596	0	a	dependent.
18597	0	a	Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute
18598	0	a	onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and
18599	0	a	diaphoresis while at home.
18600	0	a	Called EMS and was brought to the
18601	0	a	Emergency Department.
18602	0	a	The patient is unable to give a full
18603	0	a	history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory
18604	0	a	distress.
18605	0	a	Please review resident's note for full details of
18606	0	a	obtainable past medical history, social history, review of
18607	0	a	systems, medications, and allergies.
18608	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as
18609	0	a	documented.
18610	0	a	The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.
18611	0	a	Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted
18612	26	a	at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.
18613	0	a	Physical exam
18614	0	a	reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with
18615	0	a	accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.
18616	0	a	She has rales
18617	0	a	halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
18618	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.
18619	0	a	Abdomen is obese but soft.
18620	0	a	Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees.
18621	0	a	Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.
18622	0	a	On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual
18623	67	a	nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.
18624	0	a	She is known to make urine, a
18625	0	a	Foley catheter was placed immediately.
18626	0	a	IV access was
18627	0	a	established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics.
18628	67	a	Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.
18629	0	a	On
18630	0	a	BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.
18631	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit
18632	0	a	of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.
18633	0	a	BNP was noted at
18634	0	a	700.
18635	0	a	Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was
18636	0	a	less than assay.
18637	0	a	However, labs were obtained within half an hour
18638	0	a	of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.
18639	0	a	Urinalysis
18640	0	a	was negative and urine HCG was negative.
18641	0	a	EKG was sinus
18642	0	a	tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for
18643	0	a	rate-related ischemia.
18644	0	a	There were no prior EKGs available.
18645	0	a	Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.
18646	0	a	The Nephrology fellow covering
18647	0	a	hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate
18648	0	a	hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.
18649	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and
18650	0	a	CHF.
18651	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is
18652	0	a	likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary
18653	0	a	edema and subsequent symptomatology.
18654	0	a	Given the current regimen,
18655	0	a	in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.
18656	0	a	The
18657	0	a	respiratory rate was noted at 23.
18658	0	a	Her heart rate came down to
18659	0	a	113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV
18660	26	a	nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.

18675	90	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care.
18676	0	a	He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.
18677	0	a	Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.
18678	0	a	Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.
18679	0	a	Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.
18680	0	a	He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.
18681	0	a	He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.
18682	0	a	Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.
18683	0	a	He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.
18684	0	a	He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.
18685	0	a	He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.
18686	0	a	This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.
18687	28	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.
18688	41	a	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.
18689	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
18690	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.
18691	0	a	His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.
18692	0	a	Sinuses: Non-tender.
18693	0	a	Nasal turbinates: Benign.
18694	0	a	Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.
18695	0	a	Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.
18696	0	a	Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.
18697	0	a	I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.
18698	0	a	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.
18699	0	a	Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.
18700	0	a	Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.
18701	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.
18702	0	a	I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.
18703	0	a	He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.

18880	0	a	MRN:     8514931
18881	28	a	The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,

18884	0	a	was seeing the neurologist today for follow up.
18885	0	a	She has not had recent TIA symptoms
18886	7	a	but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.
18887	0	a	Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she
18888	0	a	has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she
18889	0	a	walks about one block.
18890	0	a	The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both
18891	0	a	sides of her chest.
18892	0	a	It is not severe, sharp chest pain.
18893	0	a	It does not radiate to her back.
18894	0	a	There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain.
18895	0	a	No PND, orthopnea or edema.
18896	0	a	The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago.
18897	0	a	She has a history of TIAs and our
18898	0	a	goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a
18899	0	a	low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.
18900	40	a	She is on aspirin and Plavix.
18901	0	a	She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.
18902	0	a	She has not had a recent stress test.
18903	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress.
18904	0	a	Her blood

18913	0	a	Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
18914	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story
18915	7	a	which sounds convincing for exertional angina.
18916	0	a	She has not had any symptoms in over
18917	0	a	two weeks.
18918	42	a	Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
18919	0	a	b.i.d.
18920	0	a	She should stop it if she
18921	0	a	feels lightheaded on the medication.
18922	40	a	She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d.
18923	0	a	We
18924	0	a	will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT.

18933	0	a	"Re:	Horn, Gregory"
18934	0	a	"	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23"
18935	0	a	Dear Dr. Givens:
18936	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease.
18937	0	a	He has managed to lose 3 lbs.
18938	15	a	on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.
18939	0	a	His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.
18940	0	a	They both attribute it to the Prilosec.
18941	0	a	He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.
18942	0	a	He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.
18943	0	a	Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.
18944	0	a	No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.
18945	0	a	Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.
18946	0	a	On examination, he is well appearing.
18947	0	a	Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored.
18948	0	a	Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff.
18949	0	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
18950	0	a	Oropharynx is clear.
18951	0	a	Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy.
18952	0	a	Back:  Normal configuration.
18953	0	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.
18954	0	a	Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.
18955	0	a	JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.
18956	0	a	Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
18957	0	a	Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.
18958	0	a	Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.
18959	0	a	My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.
18960	0	a	Impression:
18961	0	a	1.
18962	0	a	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.
18963	0	a	Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
18964	0	a	However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.
18965	0	a	There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.
18966	15	a	He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.
18967	0	a	2.
18968	0	a	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
18969	0	a	If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.
18970	0	a	3.
18971	0	a	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
18972	0	a	4.
18973	0	a	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.
18974	0	a	5.
18975	0	a	Chronic cough.
18976	0	a	6.
18977	15	a	Diabetes - Better controlled.
18978	0	a	7.
18979	84	a	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.
18980	0	a	As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.
18981	0	a	Recommendations:
18982	0	a	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d.
18983	0	a	dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.
18984	0	a	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
18985	0	a	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.
18986	0	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
18987	0	a	Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.
18988	0	a	Sincerely,

19786	0	a	RE:  Christine Olivier
19787	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
19788	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
19789	0	a	Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
19790	0	a	regarding her current cardiac condition.
19791	0	a	As her history is well
19792	0	a	known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.
19793	0	a	Mrs.
19794	0	a	Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
19795	3	a	coronary artery disease.
19796	0	a	After several catheterizations in the
19797	3	a	2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
19798	7	a	(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
19799	3	a	showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
19800	0	a	was managed medically.
19801	0	a	However, she suffered a non-Q wave
19802	0	a	myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
19803	0	a	underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
19804	0	a	artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
19805	0	a	bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
19806	0	a	her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
19807	0	a	marginal branch.
19808	0	a	She underwent repeat catheterization in February
19809	0	a	of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
19810	0	a	but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
19811	0	a	She
19812	0	a	underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
19813	7	a	a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
19814	0	a	proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
19815	0	a	with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
19816	9	a	and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
19817	0	a	The saphenous
19818	0	a	vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
19819	0	a	stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
19820	0	a	to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
19821	0	a	saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
19822	0	a	The left
19823	0	a	intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
19824	0	a	stenoses.
19825	0	a	Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
19826	0	a	posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%.
19827	0	a	She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
19828	0	a	in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
19829	0	a	to her diagonal artery.
19830	0	a	She tolerated this uneventfully and was

19833	0	a	discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
19834	0	a	discomfort.
19835	0	a	Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
19836	0	a	exertional dyspnea.
19837	0	a	She has undergone extensive pulmonary
19838	0	a	evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
19839	0	a	have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
19840	0	a	1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
19841	0	a	with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.
19842	0	a	In
19843	15	a	addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
19844	28	a	hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.
19845	59	a	Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
19846	59	a	insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
19847	40	a	coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril

19854	0	a	prn.
19855	0	a	Cigarettes - none at present.
19856	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
19857	0	a	no acute distress.
19858	26	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
19859	0	a	rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
19860	0	a	pounds.
19861	0	a	The neck is supple.
19862	0	a	JVP flat.
19863	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without
19864	0	a	significant bruits.
19865	0	a	Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
19866	0	a	rhonchi.
19867	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
19868	0	a	and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
19869	0	a	the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
19870	0	a	The abdomen is
19871	0	a	benign with bowel sounds well heard.
19872	0	a	Extremities without
19873	0	a	appreciable edema.
19874	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
19875	0	a	There is 1+
19876	0	a	bipedal edema.
19877	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.
19878	0	a	PR interval
19879	0	a	of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.
19880	0	a	There is evidence of a
19881	0	a	left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
19882	0	a	through V3.
19883	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
19884	15	a	atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
19885	0	a	exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
19886	0	a	She denies any active chest
19887	0	a	discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
19888	7	a	alleviating the chest pain syndrome.
19889	0	a	The records available to me
19890	0	a	indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
19891	0	a	blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
19892	7	a	exacerbation of her angina.
19893	0	a	However, now that she is status post
19894	0	a	her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
19895	43	a	reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
19896	0	a	50 mg po q.d.
19897	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked within the
19898	0	a	next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will
19899	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5                    -3-            July 05, 2074
19900	47	a	also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
19901	0	a	edema and in part because she may no longer need this.
19902	0	a	Otherwise,
19903	0	a	I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
19904	0	a	to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
19905	0	a	can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
19906	7	a	close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur.
19907	0	a	I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
19908	0	a	appropriate.

20307	0	a	HPI: 
20308	29	a	79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI.
20309	0	a	It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday.
20310	0	a	She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV.
20311	0	a	She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress.
20312	0	a	ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection.
20313	14	a	Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16.
20314	10	a	On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow.
20315	0	a	Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most.
20316	0	a	LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.
20317	0	a	A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.
20318	0	a	On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr.
20319	0	a	Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012.
20320	0	a	Her Temp.
20321	0	a	was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission.
20322	0	a	She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K.
20323	0	a	Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP.
20324	0	a	Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr.
20325	0	a	When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin.
20326	1	a	The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

20627	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.
20628	26	a	Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.
20629	0	a	Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.

20640	0	a	I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.
20641	57	a	I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.
20642	57	a	She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.
20643	57	a	She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.

20645	0	a	She will check a fasting fingerstick.

20946	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
20947	0	a	Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.
20948	0	a	Currently, she
20949	0	a	complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
20950	0	a	discomfort.
20951	0	a	In addition, she states that she has no energy and

20953	0	a	She
20954	66	a	reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
20955	0	a	discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.
20956	57	a	She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
20957	57	a	units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
20958	40	a	sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg

20962	0	a	mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
20963	0	a	twenty-four hour period.
20964	0	a	Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress.
20965	26	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
20966	0	a	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.
20967	0	a	The neck is
20968	0	a	supple.
20969	0	a	JVP flat.
20970	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
20971	0	a	Chest is completely clear.
20972	0	a	Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
20973	0	a	physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
20974	0	a	radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
20975	0	a	murmur or rub.
20976	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
20977	0	a	Extremities without
20978	0	a	appreciable edema.
20979	0	a	Peripheral pulses are intact.
20980	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.

20989	0	a	Olivier, Christine
20990	0	a	MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
20991	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
20992	1	a	multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.
20993	0	a	Currently it is not
20994	0	a	clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
20995	0	a	however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
20996	0	a	(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.
20997	0	a	In addition, I
20998	0	a	will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
20999	0	a	hemoglobin.
21000	0	a	It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
21001	0	a	generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause.
21002	0	a	Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
21003	0	a	present regimen.
21004	0	a	She will contact you or myself should her chest
21005	0	a	pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.
21006	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

21245	0	a	He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.
21246	0	a	As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.
21247	0	a	He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.
21248	0	a	I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.
21249	0	a	The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.
21250	0	a	MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.
21251	0	a	The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.
21252	0	a	He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.
21253	0	a	The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.
21254	0	a	Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.
21255	0	a	Sincerely,

21436	0	a	 January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:
21437	0	a	"	He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas."
21438	0	a	He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago.
21439	0	a	Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on.
21440	0	a	This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein.
21441	0	a	He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions.
21442	0	a	A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion.
21443	0	a	Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma.
21444	0	a	The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
21445	0	a	His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
21446	88	a	He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.
21447	0	a	His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.
21448	71	a	His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.
21449	0	a	He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
21450	0	a	His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis.
21451	0	a	He has had some mild recent weight loss.
21452	0	a	He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease.
21453	0	a	His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
21454	0	a	I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time.
21455	0	a	With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation.
21456	0	a	He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy.
21457	0	a	I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter.
21458	0	a	After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT.
21459	0	a	He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us.
21460	0	a	This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up.
21461	0	a	I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
21462	0	a	I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

21717	0	a	She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.
21718	0	a	She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.
21719	0	a	There is no operative report from the procedure.
21720	0	a	Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.
21721	0	a	Tissue appeared fairly healthy.
21722	0	a	She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.
21723	0	a	She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.

21784	0	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
21785	0	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
21786	0	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
21787	0	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
21788	0	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
21789	0	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
21790	0	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
21791	0	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
21792	0	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

21843	0	a	HPI: 
21844	0	a	This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain.
21845	0	a	The first episode started this AM (10AM).
21846	0	a	It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic.
21847	0	a	Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v.
21848	0	a	Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.
21849	40	a	He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case.
21850	1	a	He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.
21851	0	a	Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain.
21852	66	a	On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain.
21853	44	a	He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker.
21854	1	a	His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3.
21855	0	a	First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

22049	0	a	for the last year, which he discontinued 
22050	0	a	last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks

22053	0	a	He states that over the last two or

22079	0	a	pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart

22114	0	a	Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow

22121	0	a	I 
22122	0	a	     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it

22124	0	a	     diet.
22125	0	a	3.
22126	0	a	Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.
22127	0	a	I will get a

22130	0	a	4.
22131	0	a	Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this

22147	0	a	male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.
22148	0	a	Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection.
22149	0	a	His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.
22150	0	a	Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss.
22151	0	a	During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.
22152	0	a	His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake.
22153	0	a	Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition.
22154	0	a	He was discharged without incident on 12/30.
22155	0	a	The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months.

22631	0	a	33 y.o.
22632	0	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
22633	23	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
22634	0	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
22635	27	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
22636	57	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
22637	0	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
22638	57	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
22639	0	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
22640	0	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
22641	0	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
22642	43	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
22643	58	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
22644	0	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
22645	57	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
22646	0	a	No concentrated sweets diet
22647	30	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
22648	0	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
22649	0	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
22650	0	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
22651	0	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
22652	0	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

22848	57	a	HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
22849	28	a	dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
22850	0	a	learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
22851	0	a	presenting for follow up of his DVT.
22852	0	a	The patient's current medical 
22853	0	a	problems include:
22854	0	a	1.
22855	0	a	Recent DVT.
22856	0	a	The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
22857	0	a	     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.
22858	0	a	The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
22859	0	a	     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
22860	0	a	     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
22861	0	a	     previously over the recent few weeks.
22862	0	a	The patient stated he awoke 
22863	0	a	     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
22864	0	a	     quadriceps and right calf.
22865	0	a	He later developed progressive swelling 
22866	0	a	     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
22867	0	a	     department.
22868	0	a	He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
22869	0	a	     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.
22870	0	a	He was 
22871	0	a	     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
22872	0	a	The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
22873	0	a	     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
22874	0	a	     sent off which was negative.
22875	0	a	The patient currently returns to me 
22876	0	a	     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.
22877	0	a	He states that 
22878	0	a	     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
22879	0	a	     occur during his hospital course.
22880	0	a	The patient was also angry and 
22881	0	a	     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.
22882	0	a	I 
22883	0	a	     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
22884	0	a	     his emergency department visit.
22885	0	a	I called all of the parties 
22886	0	a	     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
22887	0	a	     occurred.
22888	0	a	2.
22889	27	a	Hypertension.
22890	0	a	The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
22891	31	a	     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
22892	0	a	     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
22893	0	a	     discontinued recently.
22894	0	a	With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
22895	0	a	     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
22896	0	a	3.
22897	15	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
22898	0	a	I recently started the patient on 
22899	57	a	     insulin.
22900	0	a	He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
22901	0	a	     did not make his visit.
22902	57	a	His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
22903	57	a	     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
22904	0	a	     the morning and 15 units of regular.
22905	0	a	In the evening he takes 10 
22906	57	a	     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.
22907	0	a	The patient does not yet have 
22908	0	a	     a home glucometer.
22909	0	a	We will arrange for this.

22924	0	a	Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.
22925	0	a	Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
22926	0	a	significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.
22927	0	a	Impression:
22928	0	a	1)   DVT.
22929	0	a	Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
22930	0	a	     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.
22931	0	a	     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
22932	0	a	My feeling is that the DVT 
22933	0	a	     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
22934	0	a	     therapeutic at the present time.
22935	0	a	I have arranged for the patient to 
22936	0	a	     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
22937	0	a	     check of his PT.
22938	0	a	I left instructions that I should be called 
22939	0	a	     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
22940	0	a	     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
22941	0	a	     cane to help with ambulation.
22942	15	a	2)   Adult onset diabetes.
22943	0	a	I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
22944	0	a	     next office visit.
22945	0	a	A finger stick in the office approximately three 
22946	0	a	     hours after eating is 253.
22947	0	a	I feel this is still too elevated.
22948	57	a	     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.
22949	0	a	     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
22950	0	a	     adjustments in his medications at that time.

23074	0	a	Dear Dr. Easterling: 
23075	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI.
23076	0	a	As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation.

23592	0	a	Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.
23593	0	a	I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.
23594	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.
23595	28	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.
23596	0	a	He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.

23598	0	a	This is relieved by sitting.

23600	0	a	This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
23601	0	a	He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.
23602	0	a	Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.

23617	0	a	He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.
23618	0	a	When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.
23619	0	a	There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.
23620	26	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.
23621	0	a	Pulse of 60 and regular.
23622	0	a	Carotids 2+ without bruits.
23623	0	a	Mental status:  Unremarkable.
23624	0	a	Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.
23625	0	a	No evidence of retinopathy.
23626	0	a	Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.
23627	0	a	Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
23628	0	a	Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
23629	0	a	Rapid alternating movements intact.
23630	0	a	Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
23631	0	a	Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
23632	0	a	The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.
23633	0	a	Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.
23634	0	a	Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.

23636	0	a	He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.
23637	0	a	DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
23638	0	a	Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
23639	0	a	The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
23640	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  
23641	0	a	1.
23642	0	a	Neuropathy.
23643	0	a	The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
23644	0	a	He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
23645	0	a	He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.
23646	0	a	There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
23647	0	a	I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.
23648	0	a	I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
23649	0	a	He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
23650	0	a	I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
23651	0	a	Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.
23652	0	a	The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
23653	0	a	DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

23749	0	a	NAME:     Hendrickson, Ora 
23750	0	a	MRN:      7194334
23751	0	a	This patient is here for a follow-up.
23752	0	a	She was seen with a very complete evaluation 
23753	0	a	by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.
23754	0	a	She submitted a
23755	0	a	urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her
23756	0	a	urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.
23757	0	a	A fair amount retained
23758	0	a	as postvoid residual.
23759	0	a	Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with
23760	0	a	resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor
23761	0	a	and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
23762	0	a	She
23763	0	a	has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent
23764	0	a	infections.
23765	0	a	She is most concerned about having cancer.
23766	0	a	She is scheduled to see Dr.
23767	0	a	Quezada March 24th.
23768	0	a	The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
23769	0	a	been issues going around the housing projects.
23770	0	a	A 14-year-old girl was raped and
23771	0	a	one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
23772	0	a	She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
23773	0	a	She did not file a
23774	0	a	police report.
23775	0	a	As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
23776	0	a	reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix
23777	0	a	approximately one week ago.
23778	0	a	She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet
23779	0	a	sporadically but not on a regular basis.
23780	0	a	She denies any chest pressure or
23781	0	a	palpitations.
23782	0	a	She denies any shortness of breath.
23783	0	a	She denies any problems with
23784	0	a	pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.
23785	26	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.
23786	0	a	Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
23787	0	a	No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
23788	0	a	UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.
23789	0	a	Her
23790	0	a	ankle reveals trace edema on the left.
23791	0	a	Her right extremity is warm to palpation.
23792	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
23793	29	a	(1)  Hypertension.
23794	0	a	Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
23795	0	a	This
23796	0	a	     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.
23797	0	a	I have
23798	0	a	     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d.
23799	0	a	on a regular
23800	0	a	     basis.
23801	0	a	(2)  Anxiety.
23802	0	a	I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try
23803	0	a	     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.
23804	0	a	(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
23805	0	a	She had a urine culture submitted today.
23806	0	a	She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.
23807	0	a	     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
23808	0	a	I attempted to
23809	0	a	     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current
23810	0	a	     recurrent infections.
23811	0	a	It is more likely due to her cystocele.
23812	0	a	(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.
23813	0	a	This appears stable.
23814	0	a	She remains off the
23815	0	a	     cigarettes.
23816	0	a	(5)  ASCVD.
23817	0	a	She remains without symptoms.
23818	0	a	(6)  GERD.
23819	0	a	She remains on the Prilosec.
23820	22	a	(7)  Hyperlipidemia.
23821	70	a	She remains on Lipitor.
23822	0	a	She should have a repeat
23823	0	a	     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.
23824	0	a	(8)  Borderline high sugar.
23825	0	a	The patient should also have this rechecked with the

24255	0	a	Dear Dr. Galvan:
24256	3	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.
24257	0	a	He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.
24258	0	a	Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.
24259	0	a	No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.
24260	0	a	No reflux symptoms.
24261	0	a	Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.
24262	0	a	He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.
24263	0	a	Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d.
24264	30	a	(continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.
24265	0	a	On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.
24266	0	a	Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.
24267	0	a	Conjunctivae are clear.
24268	0	a	Sinuses nontender.
24269	0	a	Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.
24270	0	a	Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.
24271	0	a	No goiter or adenopathy.
24272	0	a	Back:  Normal configuration.
24273	0	a	Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.
24274	0	a	Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.
24275	0	a	Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.
24276	0	a	Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
24277	0	a	Skin:  Well tanned.
24278	0	a	Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.
24279	0	a	CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.
24280	0	a	Impression:
24281	0	a	Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.
24282	0	a	Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.
24283	3	a	Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.
24284	0	a	Myasthenia, mainly ocular.
24285	0	a	Prior Raynaud's syndrome.
24286	0	a	Recommendations:
24287	0	a	Continue Advair at the current dose.
24288	0	a	Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o.
24289	0	a	q. p.m.
24290	0	a	Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.
24291	0	a	Continue exercise program.
24292	0	a	Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.
24293	0	a	It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.

24365	0	a	RE:Craft, Lloyd
24366	0	a	MRN:26649180
24367	0	a	Dear Dr. Short:
24368	0	a	Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr.
24369	0	a	Craft for the 
24370	0	a	possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
24371	0	a	As you know, he 
24372	0	a	is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
24373	0	a	history for a rheumatological disease.
24374	0	a	His past medical history, 
24375	0	a	briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
24376	0	a	time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
24377	0	a	he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
24378	0	a	characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
24379	0	a	stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.
24380	0	a	All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
24381	0	a	He was 
24382	0	a	treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
24383	0	a	that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
24384	0	a	symptoms and seizures went away.
24385	0	a	Since that time, he has had a 
24386	0	a	recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
24387	0	a	neck, pressure within his head.
24388	0	a	He considers himself to have 
24389	0	a	vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
24390	0	a	numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
24391	0	a	salivation and increased appetite.
24392	0	a	In describing his headache, he 
24393	0	a	noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
24394	0	a	has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
24395	0	a	quality.
24396	0	a	It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
24397	0	a	associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.
24398	0	a	There is no 
24399	0	a	family history of migraines as well.
24400	0	a	Also during his headache 
24401	0	a	events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
24402	0	a	nausea or vomiting.
24403	0	a	Past medical history:  As per above.
24404	0	a	Medicval issues include 
24405	0	a	bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
24406	0	a	gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
24407	0	a	migraine headaches.
24408	0	a	His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
24409	28	a	chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n.
24410	0	a	and 
24411	0	a	prednisone p.r.n.
24412	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.
24413	0	a	There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
24414	0	a	use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
24415	0	a	remission.
24416	0	a	3-16-14
24417	0	a	Page 2
24418	0	a	Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
24419	0	a	mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.
24420	0	a	Social history:  He is a former stage manager.
24421	0	a	Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.
24422	0	a	Attention 
24423	0	a	was normal.
24424	0	a	Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
24425	0	a	errors.
24426	0	a	There is no memory deficit or agnosia.
24427	0	a	The patient gave 
24428	0	a	a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
24429	0	a	status testing was performed.
24430	0	a	Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
24431	0	a	fields were full.
24432	0	a	Disks were sharp.
24433	0	a	Fundus was clear.
24434	0	a	Extraocular movements were intact.
24435	0	a	There was no nystagmus.
24436	0	a	He 
24437	0	a	had normal facial sensation and symmetry.
24438	0	a	Hearing was grossly 
24439	0	a	normal.
24440	0	a	Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.
24441	0	a	Motor examination 
24442	0	a	revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.
24443	0	a	Deep tendon 
24444	0	a	reflexes were symmetrical.
24445	0	a	There was no upper motor neuron sign.
24446	0	a	Coordination and gait were normal.
24447	0	a	Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
24448	0	a	of lupus in the past.
24449	0	a	His recent blood work shows that his 
24450	0	a	double-stranded DNA was negative.
24451	0	a	Taking into consideration his 
24452	0	a	current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
24453	0	a	evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
24454	0	a	disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
24455	0	a	central nervous system vasculitis.
24456	0	a	He was told that he is at a 
24457	0	a	high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
24458	23	a	pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.
24459	0	a	If it is 
24460	0	a	possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
24461	0	a	a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
24462	0	a	also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d.
24463	0	a	for primary prevention 
24464	0	a	of heart disease.
24465	0	a	He was informed that it is possible that there 
24466	0	a	is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
24467	0	a	hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
24468	0	a	symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
24469	0	a	not clear.
24470	0	a	Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.
24471	0	a	Sincerely,

24525	0	a	       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.
24526	0	a	He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.
24527	0	a	He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081.
24528	0	a	He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects.
24529	0	a	Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.
24530	0	a	evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally

24542	0	a	patent SVG to RCA.
24543	0	a	Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes.
24544	1	a	Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia.
24545	0	a	PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia.
24546	8	a	DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain.
24547	28	a	Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia.
24548	39	a	MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan.
24549	0	a	PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise.
24550	0	a	Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min.
24551	0	a	Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec).
24552	0	a	1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired.
24553	0	a	Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day.
24554	0	a	Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made.
24555	26	a	STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed.
24556	0	a	Chest pain did not occur.
24557	0	a	REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.
24558	0	a	Sinus bradycardia 56/min.
24559	0	a	First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
24560	0	a	Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
24561	5	a	However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.
24562	0	a	SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size.
24563	0	a	There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
24564	0	a	The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study.
24565	0	a	Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
24566	0	a	CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.
24567	1	a	The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

24967	0	a	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.
24968	0	a	Other potential causes include osteo or DVT.

25657	90	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.
25658	0	a	She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.
25659	0	a	Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.
25660	0	a	She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.
25661	0	a	According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.
25662	0	a	She denies any significant pain in the leg.
25663	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.
25664	0	a	The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.
25665	0	a	The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.
25666	0	a	She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.
25667	0	a	The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.
25668	0	a	The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.
25669	0	a	She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.
25670	0	a	The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.
25671	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.
25672	0	a	Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.
25673	0	a	The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.
25674	0	a	In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.
25675	0	a	There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.
25676	0	a	We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

26166	0	a	Plan:
26167	0	a	#
26168	0	a	 SOB
26169	0	a	Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.
26170	0	a	Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday.
26171	0	a	Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection.
26172	0	a	Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).

26174	0	a	-?
26175	0	a	of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea

26177	0	a	-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.
26178	0	a	BNP is not very high.
26179	0	a	However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.
26180	0	a	Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
26181	0	a	-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.

26291	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
26292	0	a	She has been doing very well.
26293	0	a	She has been exercising and has lost from 
26294	0	a	200 to 170 pounds.
26295	0	a	She is feeling very well.
26296	0	a	Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.
26297	0	a	He did not find the 
26298	0	a	first ETT acceptable.
26299	9	a	The second ETT was grossly positive.
26300	0	a	As a result 
26301	0	a	of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
26302	43	a	atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
26303	65	a	nitrate.
26304	0	a	She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
26305	0	a	pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
26306	23	a	She did have hyperlipidemia.
26307	70	a	We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
26308	0	a	provided some control.
26309	20	a	However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
26310	0	a	is not an excellent ratio.
26311	0	a	Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
26312	0	a	limits.
26313	0	a	She also has right shoulder lipoma.
26314	0	a	This has become apparent since she 
26315	0	a	lost so much weight.
26316	0	a	She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
26317	0	a	recommended Dr. Dawson.
26318	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
26319	0	a	120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.
26320	0	a	Neck is supple.
26321	0	a	There 
26322	0	a	is no lymphadenopathy.
26323	0	a	Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
26324	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
26325	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
26326	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
26327	0	a	Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.
26328	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  None today.
26329	0	a	Page 2
26330	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
26331	0	a	1.
26332	5	a	CAD.
26333	65	a	We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.
26334	0	a	I also 
26335	65	a	gave her nitroglycerine.
26336	49	a	We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
26337	43	a	continue her atenolol.
26338	40	a	She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
26339	0	a	Premarin and Synthroid.
26340	0	a	2.
26341	0	a	Weight loss.
26342	0	a	She will continue to exercise.
26343	0	a	I suspect she is going 
26344	0	a	to lose more weight.
26345	0	a	This is excellent.
26346	0	a	3.
26347	3	a	Coronary artery disease.
26348	0	a	Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
26349	0	a	cardiac catheterization.
26350	0	a	It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
26351	0	a	this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
26352	0	a	She is going to 
26353	0	a	delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
26354	0	a	done on this variety of medical issues.

26662	0	a	Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week.
26663	0	a	The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain.
26664	0	a	He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder.
26665	0	a	No fevers/chills.
26666	0	a	Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

26673	0	a	Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.
26674	0	a	Medical Decision Making ED Course
26675	0	a	75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED.
26676	0	a	The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance.
26677	0	a	Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well.
26678	0	a	Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications).
26679	0	a	Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week.
26680	0	a	Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

26837	0	a	Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.
26838	0	a	I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.
26839	0	a	I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.
26840	0	a	His PSA is low and will continue to follow.
26841	0	a	If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out
26842	0	a	2.
26843	0	a	Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease.
26844	0	a	He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past.
26845	0	a	I will broach this issue next time again
26846	0	a	3.
26847	0	a	DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,.
26848	0	a	He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.
26849	0	a	Will check lipids.
26850	0	a	Will continue to monitor BP.

26858	0	a	OFFICE VISIT (CHC)
26859	0	a	The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.
26860	0	a	He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.
26861	0	a	He has had an eventful past six months.
26862	0	a	In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.
26863	0	a	He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.
26864	0	a	His symptomatology fortunately clear.
26865	0	a	His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.
26866	0	a	About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.
26867	0	a	He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.
26868	0	a	Not long after this, he went into renal failure.
26869	0	a	He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.
26870	0	a	According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9.
26871	0	a	Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.
26872	0	a	His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.
26873	0	a	He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.
26874	0	a	He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement.
26875	0	a	They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.
26876	0	a	On examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.
26877	0	a	I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.
26878	0	a	Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.
26879	0	a	He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.
26880	0	a	He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.
26881	0	a	There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.
26882	0	a	This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.
26883	0	a	There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.
26884	0	a	We will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d.
26885	0	a	for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.
26886	0	a	I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.
26887	0	a	I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.
26888	0	a	Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration.
26889	0	a	His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.
26890	0	a	I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.

27274	0	a	ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.
27275	0	a	Impression:  
27276	0	a	Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
27277	0	a	His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
27278	0	a	His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
27279	0	a	He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
27280	0	a	Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.
27281	0	a	Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.
27282	0	a	Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
27283	0	a	He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
27284	0	a	His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
27285	0	a	He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
27286	8	a	Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.
27287	0	a	His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

27415	0	a	The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
27416	0	a	Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration.
27417	0	a	On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin.
27418	0	a	The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis.

27435	0	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
27436	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4
27437	0	a	Dear Dr.
27438	0	a	Craft:
27439	0	a	I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.
27440	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
27441	0	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
27442	0	a	The patient does relate that
27443	0	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
27444	0	a	worse several years ago.
27445	0	a	However, with the treatment of his
27446	3	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
27447	0	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
27448	0	a	Since that
27449	0	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
27450	0	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
27451	0	a	At the same
27452	0	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
27453	0	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
27454	0	a	Lasix.
27455	0	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
27456	0	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
27457	0	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
27458	0	a	At the current time,
27459	0	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
27460	0	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
27461	0	a	months ago.
27462	0	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
27463	0	a	supplemental oxygen.
27464	0	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
27465	0	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
27466	0	a	coughing.
27467	15	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
27468	3	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
27469	0	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
27470	28	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
27471	0	a	upper GI bleed.
27472	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70
27473	40	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
27474	69	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
27475	57	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
27476	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
27477	0	a	He discontinued cigarette
27478	0	a	smoking years ago.
27479	0	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
27480	0	a	His pulse was
27481	0	a	56, afebrile.
27482	0	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
27483	0	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
27484	0	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
27485	0	a	He is in no
27486	0	a	respiratory distress at rest.
27487	0	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
27488	0	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
27489	0	a	His neck had no
27490	0	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
27491	0	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
27492	0	a	left base with crackles.
27493	0	a	His right lung was clear.
27494	0	a	His heart
27495	0	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
27496	0	a	murmur.
27497	0	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
27498	0	a	His
27499	0	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
27500	0	a	Pulmonary
27501	0	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
27502	0	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
27503	0	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
27504	0	a	His current
27505	0	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
27506	0	a	December.
27507	0	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
27508	0	a	I took Mr. Joshi
27509	0	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
27510	0	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
27511	0	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
27512	0	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
27513	0	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
27514	0	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
27515	0	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
27516	0	a	Mr. Joshi had several
27517	0	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
27518	0	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
27519	0	a	I do
27520	0	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
27521	0	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
27522	0	a	I do recommend that he get
27523	0	a	daily exercise.
27524	0	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
27525	0	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
27526	0	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
27527	0	a	I have also
27528	0	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
27529	0	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
27530	0	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
27531	0	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
27532	0	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary 
27533	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70
27534	0	a	vascular disease.
27535	0	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
27536	0	a	his initial work-up.
27537	0	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
27538	0	a	patient.
27539	0	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to
27540	0	a	call.

27556	0	a	Dear Dr. Null, 
27557	5	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
27558	1	a	As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.
27559	1	a	At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.
27560	5	a	No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.
27561	0	a	Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.
27562	9	a	His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.
27563	80	a	He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.
27564	7	a	He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.
27565	5	a	He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.
27566	80	a	At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.
27567	0	a	Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.
27568	0	a	He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.
27569	0	a	He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
27570	0	a	He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.
27571	0	a	He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.
27572	0	a	"He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well."
27573	0	a	He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.
27574	0	a	He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.
27575	0	a	Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.
27576	0	a	His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.
27577	0	a	Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.
27578	0	a	His past medical history includes:
27579	1	a	  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
27580	0	a	  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
27581	0	a	  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
27582	0	a	  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
27583	23	a	  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
27584	0	a	  hypothyroid
27585	0	a	  basal cell skin CA
27586	0	a	  nephrolithiasis
27587	0	a	His medications include:
27588	70	a	  Lipitor 80 mg
27589	78	a	  Plavix 150 mg
27590	40	a	  ASA 325 mg po QD
27591	44	a	  Toprol 200 mg po BID
27592	0	a	  Levoxyl
27593	0	a	  Omega-3-fatty acids
27594	0	a	  Multivitamin
27595	0	a	He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
27596	23	a	His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.
27597	0	a	He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.
27598	0	a	He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.
27599	0	a	He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.
27600	0	a	He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.
27601	88	a	He has never smoked cigarettes.
27602	0	a	He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.
27603	0	a	On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.
27604	0	a	He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
27605	0	a	His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.
27606	0	a	His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
27607	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.
27608	0	a	His abdomen is benign.
27609	0	a	He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.
27610	0	a	His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.
27611	1	a	In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.
27612	80	a	He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.
27613	80	a	Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.
27614	0	a	His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.
27615	0	a	His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.
27616	0	a	I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.
27617	0	a	As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.
27618	0	a	We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.
27619	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
27620	0	a	I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.
27621	0	a	Regards,

27981	0	a	MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  
27982	0	a	CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries.
27983	29	a	IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP.
27984	0	a	His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
27985	0	a	His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke.
27986	0	a	The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification.
27987	0	a	Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis.
27988	0	a	Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely.
27989	0	a	Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported.
27990	29	a	The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP.
27991	0	a	The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.

28254	67	a	She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.

28338	0	a	Re:  Brady Duvall
28339	0	a	     MR #425-03-15-1
28340	0	a	Dear Patricia:
28341	0	a	I saw Brady Duvall again today.
28342	0	a	He has been very stable
28343	0	a	clinically over these past six months.
28344	0	a	I believe this represents
28345	0	a	a composite of the following three major changes in his medical
28346	0	a	regimen.
28347	43	a	As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,
28348	0	a	and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.
28349	0	a	He
28350	0	a	had biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to
28351	0	a	his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose
28352	0	a	of Lasix.
28353	0	a	He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.
28354	0	a	does have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is
28355	0	a	quite reasonable.
28356	0	a	He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and
28357	32	a	Lasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril
28358	0	a	6.25 mg p.o.
28359	40	a	t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and
28360	0	a	mexiletine.
28361	0	a	His amiodarone has been discontinued.
28362	0	a	He does have
28363	0	a	asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,
28364	0	a	but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the
28365	0	a	present time.
28366	0	a	He has not been shocked by his ICD.
28367	0	a	Functionally he seems quite stable.
28368	0	a	He does have mild fatigue,
28369	0	a	but is otherwise reasonably active.
28370	0	a	He will hopefully be
28371	0	a	traveling to Miami this spring.
28372	0	a	Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs.
28373	0	a	His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.
28374	0	a	His neck
28375	0	a	veins are in fact, quite unimpressive.
28376	0	a	There is minimal jugular
28377	0	a	distention, perhaps 6-7 cm.
28378	0	a	There is no hepatojugular reflux.
28379	0	a	     MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98
28380	0	a	Lungs were clear.
28381	0	a	Examination of his heart reveals a quiet
28382	0	a	precordium.
28383	0	a	S1 and S2 seem normal.
28384	0	a	No S3, no gallop and no
28385	0	a	murmur or mitral regurgitation.
28386	0	a	Abdomen is benign without
28387	0	a	palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema.
28388	0	a	There are bilateral varicosities.
28389	0	a	His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.
28390	0	a	Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen.
28391	0	a	Accordingly, I have made no changes.
28392	0	a	I have checked appropriate
28393	0	a	electrolytes.
28394	0	a	Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.
28395	0	a	With best regards.
28396	0	a	Sincerely,

28766	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
28767	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
28768	0	a	She had 1mm 
28769	9	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
28770	0	a	disease.
28771	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
28772	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
28773	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
28774	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
28775	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
28776	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
28777	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
28778	39	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
28779	0	a	She 
28780	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
28781	0	a	for taking it.
28782	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
28783	42	a	on atenolol.
28784	26	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
28785	42	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
28786	0	a	I will continue to work 
28787	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
28788	0	a	Her other risk 
28789	15	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
28790	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
28791	0	a	Her 
28792	15	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
28793	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
28794	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
28795	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
28796	0	a	hospital.

29257	0	a	Dear Dr. Irvine:
29258	0	a	I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her 
29259	0	a	primary care physician.
29260	0	a	As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female 
29261	0	a	who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you 
29262	0	a	have been taking care of her.
29263	0	a	I have not seen her now for the past ten 
29264	0	a	months.
29265	0	a	For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history 
29266	0	a	briefly.
29267	0	a	It includes a history of atrial fibrillation.
29268	0	a	She is status 
29269	0	a	post an MVR with Duluth Clinic.
29270	0	a	She is on chronic anti-coagulation.
29271	0	a	She is 
29272	0	a	status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
29273	0	a	strep glomerular nephritis.
29274	0	a	She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
29275	0	a	several decades with no history of rejection.
29276	0	a	She also has a history of 
29277	1	a	a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement.
29278	0	a	As well, she has a 
29279	0	a	history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated 
29280	0	a	intermittently with epidural steroid injection.
29281	0	a	About a year ago, she 
29282	0	a	had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
29283	0	a	some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
29284	0	a	fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
29285	0	a	nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
29286	0	a	fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home.
29287	0	a	I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
29288	0	a	where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully 
29289	0	a	treated with levofloxacin.
29290	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
29291	0	a	include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, 
29292	47	a	Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, 
29293	42	a	Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg 
29294	67	a	three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on 
29295	0	a	her INR.
29296	0	a	ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
29297	0	a	cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
29298	0	a	which seems to have been stopped.
29299	0	a	As well, she is on sliding scale 
29300	58	a	insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently.
29301	0	a	Page 2
29302	0	a	The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were 
29303	0	a	concerned that she was not getting optimal care.
29304	0	a	In talking to her, she 
29305	0	a	says she feels quite well.
29306	0	a	She has no pain.
29307	0	a	She has no pain in her 
29308	0	a	buttocks or her legs.
29309	0	a	She says her breathing feels well.
29310	0	a	She has no 
29311	0	a	productive cough.
29312	0	a	She has no chest pain.
29313	0	a	She denies any peripheral 
29314	0	a	edema.
29315	0	a	She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
29316	0	a	exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she 
29317	0	a	is getting reasonable care.
29318	0	a	However, she does breakdown and cry about 
29319	0	a	her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
29320	0	a	home.
29321	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70.
29322	0	a	She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72.
29323	0	a	She 
29324	0	a	has sharp clicks over her chest.
29325	0	a	She has a soft abdomen with no 
29326	0	a	organomegaly and a well healed scar.
29327	0	a	She has equal pulses bilaterally.
29328	0	a	She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags.
29329	0	a	She has a full 
29330	0	a	range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and 
29331	0	a	ankles.
29332	0	a	She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
29333	0	a	she seems relatively stable.
29334	0	a	She is somewhat confused about the date and 
29335	0	a	the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly 
29336	0	a	about her current situation at Elm Hills.
29337	0	a	I have no laboratory data to speak of.
29338	0	a	I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
29339	0	a	and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
29340	0	a	and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
29341	0	a	unsupervised setting.
29342	0	a	I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
29343	0	a	place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
29344	0	a	antidepressant.
29345	0	a	It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
29346	0	a	recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of 
29347	0	a	SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects.
29348	0	a	I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, 
29349	0	a	but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
29350	0	a	me with questions about her past history.

29652	0	a	   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
29653	0	a	We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation.
29654	0	a	We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation.
29655	0	a	We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease.
29656	0	a	We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment.
29657	44	a	We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily.
29658	0	a	If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation.
29659	0	a	We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management.
29660	0	a	He has a CHAD2 Score of 0.
29661	0	a	We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time.
29662	0	a	We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed.
29663	0	a	We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status.
29664	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

29683	0	a	Dear Dr.
29684	0	a	Craft,
29685	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.
29686	0	a	This lovely gentleman with coronary artery
29687	1	a	disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction
29688	0	a	notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,
29689	0	a	who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.
29690	0	a	Despite this
29691	0	a	intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,
29692	0	a	palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present
29693	0	a	time.
29694	40	a	He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg
29695	0	a	p.o.
29696	31	a	t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,
29697	69	a	simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
29698	0	a	b.i.d., Prevacid,
29699	57	a	multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.
29700	26	a	On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.
29701	0	a	His heart
29702	0	a	rate is 54 and regular.
29703	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
29704	0	a	There is no
29705	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
29706	0	a	Carotids are without
29707	0	a	bruits.
29708	0	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
29709	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and
29710	0	a	physiologically split S2.
29711	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender.
29712	0	a	He
29713	0	a	has no bruits.
29714	0	a	His extremities are warm with strong symmetric
29715	0	a	pulses and motor strength throughout.
29716	0	a	He has no peripheral edema
29717	0	a	at the present time.
29718	0	a	His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus
29719	1	a	bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,
29720	0	a	and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior
29721	0	a	electrocardiograms.
29722	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a
29723	0	a	concerning blood pressure.
29724	0	a	At this point, he notes that he is
29725	66	a	actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue
29726	0	a	to do that.
29727	47	a	We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will
29728	0	a	be following up with you within the next few weeks.
29729	0	a	If there are
29730	0	a	any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me
29731	0	a	a call.

29745	28	a	Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
29746	23	a	hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.
29747	0	a	Mr. 
29748	0	a	Ocampo gets only semi-erections.
29749	0	a	He was quite depressed about this 
29750	0	a	issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.
29751	0	a	His 
29752	0	a	daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
29753	0	a	father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
29754	0	a	component of the issue.
29755	0	a	He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
29756	0	a	fainting spells.
29757	0	a	He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
29758	0	a	constipation.

29787	0	a	This patient was seen with Dr. Ussery.
29788	0	a	I confirm that I have
29789	0	a	interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's
29790	0	a	documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the
29791	0	a	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
29792	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a
29793	0	a	history of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.
29794	0	a	The patient
29795	0	a	denies any nausea or vomiting.
29796	1	a	He does have history of MI as
29797	3	a	well as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.
29798	0	a	He
29799	0	a	also reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has
29800	0	a	left greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive
29801	0	a	surgery following motor vehicle collision.
29802	0	a	Of note, the
29803	0	a	patient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial
29804	0	a	fibrillation.
29805	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no
29806	0	a	distress.
29807	0	a	His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory
29808	0	a	rate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on
29809	0	a	room air and 98% on 2 liters.
29810	0	a	His lungs are clear and heart is
29811	0	a	irregularly irregular.
29812	0	a	This is somewhat limited due to body
29813	0	a	habitus.
29814	0	a	The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper
29815	0	a	quadrant tenderness.
29816	0	a	The back shows left CVA tenderness.
29817	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of
29818	0	a	42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.
29819	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers are
29820	0	a	negative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.
29821	0	a	A d-dimer is less
29822	0	a	than 200.
29823	0	a	The INR is 1.7.
29824	0	a	UA is pending.
29825	0	a	ECG shows an atrial
29826	0	a	fibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3
29827	0	a	through V6.
29828	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due
29829	0	a	to patient's habitus.
29830	0	a	DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  There was no
29831	0	a	clear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.
29832	0	a	Given his
29833	0	a	anticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is
29834	0	a	unlikely to be PE.
29835	0	a	It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given
29836	3	a	the history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal
29837	0	a	electrocardiogram.
29838	0	a	This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is
29839	0	a	not terribly helpful.
29840	0	a	We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest
29841	0	a	without IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary
29842	0	a	architecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine
29843	0	a	Service for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.
29844	0	a	DIAGNOSES:
29845	0	a	1.

30152	0	a	positive.
30153	0	a	If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than
30154	0	a	she requires no further workup.
30155	0	a	However, if she is RNA positive
30156	0	a	than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of
30157	0	a	inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for
30158	0	a	treatment with interferon/ribavirin.
30159	0	a	She is amenable to this and

30235	0	a	Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital
30236	0	a	CC:  chest pain
30237	0	a	HPI:
30238	28	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.
30239	29	a	In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.
30240	0	a	He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.
30241	1	a	Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.
30242	0	a	The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.
30243	0	a	On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.
30244	0	a	Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.
30245	0	a	A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
30246	26	a	Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.
30247	43	a	His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
30248	17	a	Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
30249	41	a	He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
30250	0	a	Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.
30251	0	a	These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.
30252	0	a	The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.
30253	0	a	His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
30254	7	a	He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
30255	0	a	Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.
30256	0	a	The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.
30257	0	a	Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.
30258	0	a	The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.
30259	67	a	In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.
30260	0	a	EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
30261	0	a	Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.
30262	0	a	A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.
30263	0	a	CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.
30264	0	a	Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.

30359	0	a	Assessment:
30360	29	a	Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.
30361	1	a	The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.
30362	0	a	The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.
30363	0	a	The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.
30364	29	a	The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.
30365	0	a	In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.
30366	67	a	The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.
30367	0	a	Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.
30368	1	a	This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.
30369	0	a	EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.
30370	0	a	The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.
30371	0	a	The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.
30372	0	a	The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.
30373	0	a	Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.

30414	0	a	Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
30415	29	a	In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms.
30416	0	a	He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time.
30417	0	a	The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
30418	0	a	Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week.
30419	0	a	He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema.
30420	0	a	He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
30421	0	a	He does not know the details of the workup.
30422	41	a	Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65.
30423	43	a	He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
30424	67	a	In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro.
30425	0	a	HR was 85 and BP 135/82.
30426	41	a	He was given ASA and a BB.
30427	0	a	Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6.
30428	0	a	Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6.
30429	0	a	There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
30430	0	a	He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44).
30431	0	a	A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
30432	0	a	(the ddimer was elevated).
30433	0	a	His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
30434	0	a	On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free.
30435	0	a	Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema.
30436	41	a	ASA and BB were cont.
30437	0	a	The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
30438	0	a	However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead.
30439	0	a	This is planned for this morning.
30440	0	a	Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

30528	29	a	HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.
30529	0	a	Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.
30530	4	a	He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.
30531	0	a	Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.
30532	0	a	His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.
30533	4	a	He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.
30534	0	a	The Pt sleeps on one pillow.
30535	0	a	During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.
30536	0	a	These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.
30537	0	a	Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.
30538	0	a	He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.

30668	29	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
30669	0	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
30670	0	a	Although, there were no 
30671	0	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
30672	0	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
30673	0	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
30674	0	a	However, Pt 
30675	0	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
30676	0	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
30677	0	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
30678	0	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
30679	0	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
30680	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
30681	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
30682	0	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
30683	0	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
30684	0	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
30685	0	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
30686	0	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
30687	0	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
30688	0	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
30689	0	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
30690	29	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
30691	0	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.
30692	15	a	"3)	DM - Sugars elevated."
30693	60	a	Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.
30694	24	a	"4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable."
30695	70	a	Cont home medication of Lipitor.
30696	0	a	"5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet."
30697	0	a	Consider a diabetic diet as well.

30701	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
30702	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
30703	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
30704	0	a	Briefly:
30705	29	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
30706	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
30707	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
30708	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
30709	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
30710	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
30711	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
30712	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
30713	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

30822	0	a	Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
30823	0	a	     lower quadrant without external drainage.
30824	0	a	The abdomen was soft with mild
30825	0	a	     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
30826	0	a	     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.
30827	0	a	Extremities reveal no
30828	0	a	     edema.
30829	0	a	There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
30830	0	a	     on the left side of her foot.
30831	0	a	Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
30832	0	a	Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
30833	0	a	     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
30834	0	a	     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior
30835	0	a	     tibialis.
30836	0	a	LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
30837	0	a	     443,000.
30838	0	a	INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were
30839	0	a	     negative x3.
30840	0	a	EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
30841	0	a	Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
30842	0	a	Her
30843	0	a	     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
30844	0	a	     perfusion defects.
30845	0	a	She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
30846	0	a	     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.
30847	0	a	CT of chest with a PE
30848	0	a	     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
30849	0	a	HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
30850	0	a	     of general surgery.
30851	0	a	The patient had expressed an interest in considering
30852	0	a	     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
30853	0	a	Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
30854	0	a	     surgery.
30855	0	a	After extensive
30856	0	a	     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
30857	0	a	     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
30858	0	a	     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
30859	0	a	     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
30860	0	a	     to pursue this.
30861	0	a	Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
30862	0	a	Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.
30863	0	a	She will
30864	27	a	     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.
30865	0	a	Her chest wall pain is
30866	0	a	     likely due to esophageal spasm.
30867	0	a	Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
30868	0	a	Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
30869	0	a	     fibromyalgia.
30870	0	a	This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
30871	0	a	     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications.
30872	0	a	At the time, we
30873	0	a	     will continue pain medications for her comfort.
30874	0	a	Continue aggressive bowel
30875	0	a	     regimen.
30876	0	a	Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
30877	0	a	     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.
30878	0	a	The family currently
30879	0	a	     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
30880	0	a	Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
30881	0	a	     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
30882	0	a	     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.

31219	3	a	HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.
31220	28	a	He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking.
31221	0	a	He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
31222	0	a	He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
31223	1	a	He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
31224	7	a	He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.
31225	0	a	He has not had any rest pain.
31226	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
31227	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
31228	3	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
31229	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
31230	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
31231	89	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
31232	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
31233	40	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
31234	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
31235	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
31236	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
31237	0	a	Chest was clear.
31238	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
31239	0	a	No S3 or S4.
31240	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
31241	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
31242	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
31243	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
31244	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
31245	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
31246	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
31247	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
31248	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

31262	0	a	Dear Dr. Taylor:
31263	0	a	Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.
31264	0	a	She continues to
31265	6	a	complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
31266	0	a	secondary to exertion.
31267	0	a	These episodes occur on a roughly once a
31268	0	a	month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes.
31269	0	a	Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
31270	0	a	effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
31271	0	a	not take Nitroglycerin for it.
31272	0	a	A stress test performed last
31273	0	a	January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
31274	0	a	of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
31275	25	a	blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.
31276	0	a	She had no ischemic
31277	0	a	EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
31278	0	a	scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
31279	0	a	surrounding area of transient ischemia.
31280	0	a	In addition, there was a
31281	0	a	moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
31282	0	a	infarct mild ischemia.
31283	19	a	Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
31284	20	a	with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192.

31320	0	a	Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
31321	7	a	angina.
31322	68	a	I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
31323	0	a	q h.s.
31324	23	a	for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
31325	0	a	more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
31326	0	a	aerobic activity level.
31327	0	a	In addition, I have asked her to obtain
31328	0	a	her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
31329	0	a	ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
31330	26	a	140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
31331	0	a	antihypertensive therapy.
31332	0	a	In addition, as long as she remains

31364	0	a	feeling well.
31365	0	a	She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping.
31366	0	a	She denies orthopnea or PND.
31367	0	a	She has had stable ankle edema.
31368	40	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
31369	44	a	PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
31370	75	a	day, Avandia, and multivitamins.
31371	0	a	On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.
31372	0	a	Her heart rate is in the high 60s.
31373	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the examination table.
31374	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8.
31375	0	a	Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.
31376	0	a	Cardiac examination reveals a
31377	0	a	non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.
31378	0	a	She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
31379	0	a	at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
31380	0	a	border.
31381	0	a	She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.
31382	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.
31383	0	a	There are
31384	0	a	nonspecific ST abnormalities.
31385	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.
31386	0	a	She
31387	0	a	has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.
31388	0	a	We elected
31389	0	a	to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
31390	0	a	PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

31455	0	a	Neurology Clinic Follow-up
31456	0	a	ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections
31457	0	a	HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.
31458	0	a	Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.
31459	0	a	The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.
31460	0	a	Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.
31461	0	a	Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.
31462	0	a	He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.
31463	40	a	Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.
31464	0	a	His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.
31465	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
31466	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
31467	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
31468	0	a	The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.
31469	0	a	The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.
31470	0	a	He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
31471	0	a	His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.
31472	0	a	Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.
31473	0	a	The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.
31474	0	a	This may represent abscess.
31475	0	a	Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.
31476	0	a	Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.
31477	0	a	Patient denies fever or chills.
31478	0	a	He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.
31479	0	a	This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.
31480	0	a	Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.
31481	0	a	He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.
31482	0	a	His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.
31483	0	a	He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.
31484	0	a	His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.
31485	0	a	While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.
31486	0	a	He cries when he tells me about this.
31487	0	a	A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.
31488	0	a	He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.
31489	0	a	His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.
31490	0	a	There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.
31491	0	a	He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.
31492	0	a	An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.
31493	0	a	He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.
31494	0	a	Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.
31495	0	a	They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses.

31912	0	a	07/28/2125
31913	3	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dennis Holcomb is a lovely 57-year-old gentleman with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with known ventricular tachycardia with AICD in place.
31914	0	a	He continues to work at Alaska Air and has multiple family obligations which are stressful to him.
31915	0	a	He has had no exertional neck, chest, arm, or jaw pain.
31916	0	a	He has not felt his AICD fire.
31917	0	a	He has had no lightheadedness or weakness.
31918	40	a	He continues on atenolol, aspirin, folate, furosemide, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin and Viagra.
31919	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, his weight is 224, heart rate is 74 and blood pressure is 120/77.
31920	0	a	There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
31921	0	a	Carotids are without bruits.
31922	0	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
31923	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI, S1, physiologically split S2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur.
31924	0	a	Abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.
31925	0	a	Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses, motor strength, and sensation.
31926	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  EKG is notable for sinus with evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction.
31927	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, Dennis has been doing well with respect to his blood pressure control and exercise.
31928	43	a	Given his current levels of stress, we are going to change his atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night, and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 190 this year, and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen.

31938	0	a	     MR #652-33-21-5
31939	0	a	Dear Dr. Arteaga:
31940	0	a	Mrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.
31941	0	a	Since last seen, she reports
31942	0	a	return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,
31943	0	a	occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.
31944	0	a	Of note, she underwent
31945	0	a	a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar
31946	0	a	syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left
31947	0	a	back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at
31948	25	a	a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60.
31949	0	a	A
31950	0	a	simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left
31951	1	a	ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction
31952	0	a	involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal
31953	0	a	peri-infarct ischemia.
31954	0	a	In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound
31955	0	a	study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right
31956	0	a	peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.
31957	47	a	Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,
31958	69	a	atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,
31959	65	a	Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40
31960	0	a	mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and
31961	57	a	Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and
31962	57	a	74 units NPH qpm.
31963	0	a	Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.
31964	0	a	Blood
31965	0	a	pressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,
31966	0	a	respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four
31967	0	a	pounds below her weight of six months ago.
31968	0	a	The neck is supple with
31969	0	a	JVP flat.
31970	0	a	Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
31971	0	a	Chest is
31972	0	a	clear.
31973	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and
31974	0	a	a I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.
31975	0	a	No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
31976	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
31977	0	a	Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema.
31978	0	a	Peripheral pulses are diminished.
31979	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval
31980	0	a	of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25.
31981	0	a	There is borderline
31982	0	a	Page Two
31983	0	a	evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
31984	0	a	wave changes.
31985	0	a	Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has
31986	0	a	been no significant change.
31987	0	a	Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left
31988	0	a	shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
31989	7	a	surgery angina.
31990	0	a	In this setting, a dobutamine stress test
31991	0	a	performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.
31992	0	a	I
31993	0	a	have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
31994	0	a	therapeutic and diagnostic options.
31995	0	a	She made it quite clear that
31996	0	a	she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,
31997	0	a	and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility
31998	0	a	(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
31999	0	a	vascularization.
32000	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me that her left
32001	0	a	shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly
32002	0	a	understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities.
32003	0	a	I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.
32004	0	a	In the
32005	0	a	meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort
32006	0	a	syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
32007	65	a	bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
32008	0	a	morning.
32009	0	a	She will call me within the next several days to report
32010	0	a	how this helps her discomfort syndrome.
32011	0	a	I do not believe that she
32012	0	a	is having GERD to explain her symptoms.
32013	0	a	In light of her reluctance
32014	0	a	to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to
32015	0	a	tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
32016	0	a	discomfort syndrome.
32017	0	a	I, of course, will keep you fully informed as
32018	0	a	to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her
32019	0	a	care.
32020	0	a	Sincerely yours,
32021	0	a	Irineo Tovar, M.D.

32194	0	a	His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.
32195	0	a	He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.
32196	0	a	The right ventricular impulse is present also.
32197	0	a	He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.
32198	0	a	It does not change with respiration.

32212	0	a	His standing blood pressure is unchanged.
32213	0	a	He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.
32214	0	a	ASSESSMENT:
32215	0	a	1.
32216	0	a	Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.
32217	0	a	We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.
32218	0	a	The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.
32219	0	a	He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.
32220	0	a	However, the episodicity is significant.
32221	0	a	2.
32222	0	a	Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.
32223	0	a	His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.
32224	0	a	However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.
32225	0	a	It is also possible that this is related to angina.
32226	0	a	3.
32227	0	a	Other related risks.
32228	0	a	He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.
32229	0	a	It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.
32230	0	a	There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.
32231	0	a	At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.
32232	0	a	Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.
32233	0	a	We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

32624	0	a	Dear Ken:
32625	1	a	Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
32626	1	a	As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.
32627	0	a	He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.
32628	0	a	His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.
32629	0	a	He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.
32630	0	a	He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.
32631	0	a	Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.
32632	0	a	He is slowly recovering his overall strength.
32633	0	a	The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.
32634	0	a	On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
32635	40	a	q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
32636	0	a	q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o.
32637	0	a	q.d., p.r.n.
32638	0	a	Tylenol No.
32639	0	a	3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o.
32640	0	a	q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o.
32641	44	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o.
32642	0	a	q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o.
32643	69	a	b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o.
32644	0	a	q.d.
32645	0	a	Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.
32646	0	a	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.
32647	0	a	The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
32648	0	a	Chest is clear.
32649	0	a	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.
32650	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
32651	0	a	Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.
32652	0	a	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.
32653	0	a	There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.
32654	0	a	An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.
32655	0	a	No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.
32656	1	a	Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.
32657	0	a	I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.
32658	0	a	I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.
32659	0	a	At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.
32660	0	a	In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.
32661	0	a	In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.
32662	5	a	I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.
32663	0	a	He will have routine blood studies obtained today.
32664	0	a	I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.
32665	0	a	Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.
32666	0	a	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.
32667	0	a	Sincerely yours,

32764	0	a	PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel
32765	0	a	Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note
32766	0	a	Code: Full
32767	0	a	CC:     Want to get my chemo   
32768	0	a	ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.
32769	0	a	HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
32770	0	a	He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.
32771	0	a	He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.
32772	0	a	He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
32773	0	a	Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
32774	0	a	The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.
32775	0	a	PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.
32776	0	a	It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
32777	0	a	The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
32778	0	a	PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
32779	0	a	The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.
32780	17	a	Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.
32781	0	a	Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.
32782	0	a	Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.
32783	0	a	He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
32784	0	a	Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
32785	0	a	He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
32786	0	a	On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.
32787	0	a	He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
32788	0	a	He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
32789	0	a	He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.
32790	0	a	Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

32946	0	a	       783-61-34-3
32947	0	a	Dear Dr. Kay: 
32948	0	a	I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
32949	0	a	She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
32950	0	a	I will review her history for the record.
32951	0	a	She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.
32952	0	a	Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
32953	0	a	Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.
32954	0	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
32955	0	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
32956	0	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
32957	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
32958	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
32959	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
32960	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
32961	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
32962	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
32963	0	a	Cultures were negative.
32964	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
32965	0	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
32966	0	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
32967	0	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
32968	0	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
32969	0	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
32970	0	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
32971	0	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
32972	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
32973	11	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
32974	0	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
32975	0	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
32976	0	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
32977	0	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
32978	0	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
32979	29	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
32980	40	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
32981	0	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
32982	0	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
32983	0	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
32984	0	a	There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
32985	90	a	She is a widow.
32986	0	a	She has four children.
32987	0	a	She used to work for Lowe's.
32988	0	a	She now lives with a daughter.
32989	0	a	She has had no recent fever or chills.
32990	0	a	Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
32991	0	a	There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
32992	0	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
32993	0	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
32994	0	a	Pulse 126, regular.
32995	0	a	BP 126/66.
32996	84	a	She is obese.
32997	0	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
32998	0	a	There are no cranial bruits.
32999	0	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
33000	0	a	There are wheezes bilaterally.
33001	0	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
33002	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
33003	0	a	The extremities are normal.
33004	0	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
33005	0	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
33006	0	a	She is oriented to place.
33007	0	a	She is inattentive.
33008	0	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
33009	0	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
33010	0	a	There is no aphasia.
33011	0	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
33012	0	a	The visual fields are full.
33013	0	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
33014	0	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
33015	0	a	.
33016	0	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
33017	0	a	Facial sensation is intact.
33018	0	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
33019	0	a	Hearing is grossly intact.
33020	0	a	Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
33021	0	a	The palate elevates normal.
33022	0	a	Gag is present.
33023	0	a	The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
33024	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
33025	0	a	Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.
33026	0	a	There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.
33027	0	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
33028	0	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
33029	0	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
33030	0	a	Coordination is intact.
33031	0	a	Romberg is negative.
33032	0	a	Gait and station are normal.
33033	0	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
33034	0	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
33035	0	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
33036	0	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
33037	0	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
33038	0	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
33039	0	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
33040	0	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
33041	0	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
33042	0	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
33043	0	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
33044	0	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
33045	0	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
33046	0	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
33047	0	a	Thank you for this consultation.
33048	0	a	Sincerely,

33259	0	a	Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD
33260	0	a	Date of visit:  March 27, 2062
33261	0	a	Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.
33262	0	a	Hematologic History:
33263	17	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.
33264	0	a	At the time, blood sugar was >500.
33265	25	a	Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.
33266	28	a	The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
33267	0	a	At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA.
33268	0	a	Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
33269	0	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
33270	0	a	He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.
33271	0	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
33272	0	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
33273	0	a	Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.
33274	0	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
33275	28	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
33276	0	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
33277	0	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
33278	0	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
33279	0	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
33280	0	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).
33281	0	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
33282	0	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
33283	0	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.
33284	0	a	His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
33285	0	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
33286	0	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
33287	0	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
33288	0	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
33289	40	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
33290	0	a	He was discharged from the hospital in September.
33291	0	a	Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.
33292	0	a	Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.
33293	0	a	His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%).
33294	0	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.
33295	0	a	His platelets were 502,000.
33296	0	a	An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.
33297	0	a	He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.
33298	0	a	His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid.
33299	0	a	Interval History:
33300	0	a	Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.
33301	0	a	When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.
33302	0	a	A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.
33303	0	a	He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.
33304	0	a	In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.
33305	0	a	He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.
33306	0	a	He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.
33307	0	a	He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.
33308	0	a	He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.

33362	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
33363	28	a	Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency, subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and several small embolic-appearing strokes.
33364	0	a	In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
33365	0	a	He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.
33366	0	a	It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
33367	0	a	We are following his CBC on hydrea.
33368	0	a	His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).
33369	0	a	He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.
33370	0	a	His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.
33371	0	a	We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.
33372	0	a	At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.
33373	0	a	We would advise continuing current hydrea.
33374	0	a	Continue current hydrea
33375	0	a	Monitor counts monthly
33376	0	a	Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine.
33377	0	a	Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts
33378	0	a	The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.

33384	0	a	MAH#:  915-65-93
33385	0	a	DATE OF VISIT:  November 10, 2097
33386	0	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  
33387	0	a	Mr. Nielson is a 77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin s lymphoma who is status post four cycles of CHOP-R chemotherapy with persistent disease (documented by PET and biopsy).
33388	0	a	He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.
33389	0	a	As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday.
33390	0	a	He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.
33391	0	a	INTERVAL HISTORY:
33392	0	a	He describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.
33393	0	a	He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then.
33394	0	a	However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure.
33395	0	a	In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid.
33396	0	a	This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.
33397	0	a	Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.
33398	0	a	In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so  he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.
33399	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  
33400	72	a	glyburide 10 mg

33406	0	a	Bactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday
33407	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
33408	0	a	Weight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130/80, and respiratory rate is 20.
33409	0	a	Pain index is 0/10.
33410	0	a	Fatigue index is 5/10.
33411	0	a	Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats.
33412	0	a	Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.
33413	0	a	LABORATORY STUDIES:  
33414	0	a	White blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45.
33415	0	a	Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208.
33416	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  
33417	0	a	Given his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure  We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms.
33418	0	a	I suspect he will be admitted.
33419	0	a	Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control.
33420	0	a	Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy.
33421	0	a	As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset.

33498	0	a	RE: Benitez, Wonda
33499	0	a	MR: 89276954
33500	0	a	Dear Usha:
33501	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
33502	0	a	Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
33503	1	a	post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.
33504	0	a	As you
33505	0	a	know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
33506	0	a	wall ischemia.
33507	0	a	I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new.
33508	1	a	On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
33509	0	a	have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.
33510	0	a	Therefore,
33511	0	a	I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
33512	0	a	probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
33513	0	a	bypass this area.
33514	0	a	She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
33515	0	a	venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal.
33516	0	a	She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
33517	0	a	recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.
33518	0	a	However,
33519	0	a	she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
33520	0	a	history of otitis media in her right ear.
33521	0	a	Therefore, I think it
33522	0	a	wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
33523	0	a	her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.
33524	0	a	In the
33525	45	a	meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
33526	65	a	nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
33527	0	a	these episodes.
33528	0	a	I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
33529	0	a	these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
33530	0	a	with her cardiovascular system.
33531	0	a	She will return to see me in
33532	0	a	follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
33533	0	a	cholesterol level.
33534	0	a	Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
33535	0	a	patient.
33536	0	a	Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
33537	0	a	questions.
33538	0	a	With warm regards,

33546	90	a	Record date: 2099-06-29
33547	0	a	Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.
33548	0	a	He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.
33549	0	a	He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.
33550	0	a	He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.
33551	0	a	On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.
33552	0	a	HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.
33553	0	a	No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.
33554	26	a	His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.
33555	0	a	S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop.
33556	0	a	His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute.
33557	0	a	His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.
33558	0	a	Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.
33559	0	a	He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.
33560	0	a	He does not have any egophony.
33561	0	a	His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.
33562	0	a	The surgical wound is well-healed.
33563	0	a	There is no evidence of local recurrence.
33564	0	a	The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging.
33565	0	a	The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.
33566	0	a	In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.
33567	0	a	I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

33921	0	a	As the responsible teaching attending, I can confirm both the
33922	0	a	history and physical examination of Dr. Uriel Zapien.
33923	0	a	Briefly, the
33924	0	a	patient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk
33925	0	a	factors.
33926	0	a	She was admitted to the hospital in January after a
33927	0	a	prolonged episode of palpitations.
33928	0	a	The patient had a tiny
33929	0	a	Troponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage
33930	0	a	her conservatively.
33931	0	a	The patient continues to have these episodes
33932	0	a	of palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any
33933	0	a	exercise.
33934	43	a	Her current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,
33935	32	a	statin and an ACE Inhibitor.
33936	0	a	On physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal
33937	0	a	upstrokes and no bruits.
33938	0	a	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
33939	0	a	Her
33940	0	a	heart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,
33941	0	a	without S3 and S4.
33942	0	a	Her electrocardiogram is normal.
33943	0	a	Assessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the
33944	0	a	patient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular
33945	0	a	tachycardia.
33946	0	a	She will be seen back here in several months.

33955	0	a	RE:  Urania Yerger
33956	0	a	     MR #583-48-90-0
33957	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
33958	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first
33959	0	a	time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her
33960	3	a	coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in
33961	0	a	October of this year.
33962	0	a	Though you know her history well, I will
33963	0	a	recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
33964	0	a	Ms. Yerger is
33965	0	a	presently 81 years old.
33966	0	a	Her vascular risk factors include
33967	28	a	diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.
33968	0	a	She had no prior diagnosis
33969	0	a	of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash
33970	0	a	pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST
33971	0	a	elevation myocardial infarction.
33972	0	a	Coronary angiography at the
33973	0	a	Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,
33974	0	a	thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent
33975	0	a	complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal
33976	0	a	as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
33977	0	a	Angiography also
33978	0	a	revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.
33979	0	a	The patient underwent
33980	1	a	subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed
33981	1	a	by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
33982	0	a	(SVG to
33983	0	a	ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).
33984	0	a	Ms. Yerger's postoperative
33985	0	a	course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient
33986	0	a	episode of atrial fibrillation.
33987	0	a	Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of
33988	0	a	activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending
33989	0	a	shopping trips.
33990	0	a	Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve.
33991	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.
33992	0	a	She has
33993	0	a	had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein
33994	0	a	graft harvesting.
33995	0	a	She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA
33996	0	a	symptoms or claudication.
33997	0	a	Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
33998	0	a	Ms.
33999	0	a	Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on
34000	0	a	her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a
34001	0	a	possible viral exanthem.
34002	0	a	Yerger, Urania
34003	0	a	MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078
34004	0	a	Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency
34005	0	a	(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and
34006	0	a	prior right knee replacement.
34007	40	a	Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.
34008	72	a	day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril
34009	42	a	5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.
34010	75	a	day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.
34011	0	a	Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family
34012	0	a	members in the area.
34013	0	a	She is currently staying with her daughter.
34014	0	a	At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but
34015	0	a	is limited by chronic knee pain.
34016	88	a	She denies alcohol or tobacco
34017	0	a	use.
34018	0	a	Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.
34019	0	a	On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.
34020	0	a	She is
34021	0	a	comfortable seated on the exam table.
34022	0	a	Her skin is warm and dry.
34023	0	a	She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly
34024	0	a	on her extremities.
34025	26	a	Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate
34026	0	a	is in the 70's.
34027	0	a	She has no jugular venous distention.
34028	0	a	Her
34029	0	a	carotids are 2+ without bruits.
34030	0	a	Her chest reveals decreased breath
34031	0	a	sounds at the left base.
34032	0	a	There are no crackles or wheezes.
34033	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and
34034	0	a	rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased.
34035	0	a	There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the
34036	0	a	apex.
34037	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
34038	0	a	Her extremities are free
34039	0	a	of cyanosis or clubbing.
34040	0	a	Distal pulses are 1+.
34041	0	a	She has mild edema
34042	0	a	of the left lower extremity.
34043	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and
34044	0	a	intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.
34045	0	a	Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after
34046	1	a	her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
34047	0	a	October.
34048	0	a	Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
34049	0	a	persistent pleural effusion.
34050	0	a	We will reevaluate today with a
34051	0	a	repeat chest x-ray.
34052	0	a	In the meantime, I think that we should
34053	0	a	continue her oral diuretic regimen.
34054	0	a	It is possible that her
34055	0	a	persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
34056	0	a	Although not certain to
34057	0	a	be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today
34058	0	a	in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
34059	0	a	resolve.
34060	0	a	I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
34061	0	a	We
34062	40	a	will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for
34063	0	a	secondary prevention.
34064	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in
34065	0	a	approximately eight to twelve weeks.
34066	0	a	In addition, she will follow-
34067	0	a	up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
34068	0	a	persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
34069	0	a	symptoms.

34406	0	a	CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
34407	0	a	Dear Vicente, 
34408	0	a	Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.
34409	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year.
34410	0	a	He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
34411	0	a	In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.
34412	0	a	He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
34413	0	a	"He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep."
34414	0	a	"He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties."
34415	0	a	He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
34416	0	a	Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas.
34417	0	a	In addition, loud snoring was noted.
34418	0	a	There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes.
34419	0	a	"There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep."
34420	0	a	"There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study."
34421	0	a	In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
34422	0	a	The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm.
34423	0	a	Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes).
34424	0	a	"There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep""."
34425	0	a	"Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows""."
34426	0	a	The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general.
34427	0	a	As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.
34428	0	a	Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology).
34429	0	a	"The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day""."
34430	0	a	If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.
34431	15	a	The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.
34432	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  
34433	0	a	1.

34452	0	a	10.
34453	40	a	Coated aspirin.
34454	0	a	ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.
34455	88	a	SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage.
34456	0	a	He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years.
34457	0	a	His current weight is 195 pounds.
34458	0	a	He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.
34459	26	a	On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.
34460	0	a	HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.
34461	0	a	The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact.
34462	0	a	He is presently wearing dental braces.
34463	0	a	No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
34464	0	a	No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted.
34465	0	a	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
34466	0	a	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
34467	0	a	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
34468	0	a	"No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted."
34469	0	a	IMPRESSION:  
34470	0	a	"Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep."
34471	0	a	These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).
34472	0	a	Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea.
34473	0	a	The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm).
34474	0	a	"In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success."
34475	0	a	"One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above."
34476	0	a	Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem.
34477	0	a	While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e.
34478	0	a	in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
34479	0	a	PLAN:  
34480	0	a	In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.
34481	0	a	q. h.s.
34482	0	a	PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
34483	0	a	The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.
34484	0	a	The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.
34485	0	a	Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms).
34486	0	a	If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.
34487	0	a	In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.
34488	0	a	The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).
34489	0	a	Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez.
34490	0	a	I hope this letter finds you well.
34491	0	a	Sincerely yours,

35168	29	a	   71 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD/CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD presents with increasing frequency of left jaw pain and chest pain for the past 4 wks.
35169	1	a	After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.
35170	1	a	He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent.
35171	0	a	He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen.
35172	9	a	He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent.
35173	0	a	He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.
35174	0	a	The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.
35175	0	a	He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.
35176	0	a	He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.
35177	39	a	He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.

36146	0	a	The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate.
36147	43	a	Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose.
36148	0	a	Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5.
36149	0	a	BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired.
36150	0	a	Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it.

36250	0	a	Dear Dr. Umali:
36251	90	a	Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.
36252	0	a	Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.
36253	0	a	He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.
36254	0	a	He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.
36255	0	a	Review of systems is negative except as above.
36256	0	a	Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.
36257	0	a	Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.
36258	40	a	Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.
36259	84	a	Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.
36260	26	a	BP 169/83 and pulse 58.
36261	0	a	Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.
36262	0	a	Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
36263	0	a	Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
36264	0	a	Extremities:  No edema, warm.
36265	0	a	Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.
36266	0	a	Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.
36267	0	a	Skeletal films are pending.
36268	16	a	Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD.
36269	0	a	Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..
36270	0	a	He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.
36271	0	a	I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.
36272	0	a	I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.
36273	0	a	However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.
36274	34	a	In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.
36275	0	a	He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.
36276	0	a	Thank you for referring this patient.
36277	0	a	Sincerely,

36295	0	a	To Dr. Estep:
36296	0	a	I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.
36297	0	a	Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
36298	0	a	Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.
36299	0	a	We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
36300	0	a	In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
36301	0	a	She recalls having only V2 clinical events.
36302	0	a	She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.
36303	0	a	She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
36304	0	a	This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
36305	0	a	There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.
36306	0	a	She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.
36307	0	a	She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.
36308	0	a	She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.
36309	0	a	She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
36310	0	a	Moreover, she does not have claudication.
36311	0	a	Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.
36312	0	a	She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

36354	0	a	Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.
36355	0	a	She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.
36356	0	a	Social History:  This woman is single.
36357	0	a	She is a retired Secretary.
36358	0	a	She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.
36359	0	a	She has no other history of substance abuse.
36360	0	a	Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.
36361	0	a	She has no other new symptoms.
36362	0	a	There is no recent GI bleeding.
36363	0	a	She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.
36364	0	a	On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.
36365	0	a	Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.
36366	0	a	Head and neck exam is unremarkable.
36367	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
36368	0	a	She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
36369	0	a	Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
36370	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
36371	0	a	Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
36372	0	a	Her apex beat is within normal limits.
36373	0	a	Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
36374	0	a	Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
36375	0	a	There are no obvious masses.
36376	0	a	Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
36377	0	a	Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.
36378	0	a	They are symmetrical.
36379	0	a	Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.
36380	0	a	A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
36381	0	a	Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
36382	0	a	We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
36383	0	a	(It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).
36384	0	a	Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.
36385	0	a	If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.
36386	0	a	Her hypertension is controlled today.
36387	0	a	Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
36388	0	a	However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o.
36389	11	a	We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.
36390	0	a	It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
36391	0	a	She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
36392	0	a	We recommend.
36393	0	a	We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
36394	0	a	We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
36395	0	a	daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
36396	0	a	We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
36397	0	a	We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.
36398	0	a	We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

36496	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
36497	0	a	hives after taking Keflex.
36498	90	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
36499	0	a	chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
36500	0	a	axilla and her groin.
36501	0	a	She has been to the emergency room
36502	0	a	multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.
36503	0	a	She has
36504	0	a	been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
36505	0	a	dicloxacillin.
36506	0	a	She is planning to have her disease surgically
36507	0	a	managed in the next few months.
36508	0	a	She most recently presented to
36509	0	a	the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
36510	0	a	of her hydradenitis in her groin.
36511	0	a	She was given a prescription
36512	0	a	of Keflex.
36513	0	a	Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
36514	0	a	itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.
36515	0	a	She
36516	0	a	denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
36517	0	a	consciousness.
36518	0	a	She called the emergency room and was instructed
36519	0	a	to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
36520	0	a	reaction.
36521	0	a	So now, she is here for follow up from that.
36522	0	a	She said
36523	0	a	shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
36524	0	a	itchiness have improved very quickly.
36525	0	a	She is still complaining
36526	0	a	of purulent drainage around her groin.
36527	15	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.
36528	72	a	MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.
36529	0	a	ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.
36530	0	a	gets hives from both.
36531	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.
36532	0	a	Her bilateral
36533	0	a	groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
36534	0	a	purulent drainage.
36535	0	a	There is no fluctuance that I could feel.
36536	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.
36537	0	a	Given the
36538	0	a	recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
36539	0	a	different antibiotic.
36540	0	a	She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
36541	0	a	with good result.
36542	0	a	Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
36543	0	a	compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
36544	0	a	now.
36545	0	a	If this does not work, I think one should consider
36546	0	a	clindamycin for treatment.
36547	0	a	I will go ahead and give her 14 days
36548	0	a	worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D.
36549	0	a	if
36550	0	a	she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.
36551	0	a	I also gave
36552	0	a	her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
36553	71	a	prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.
36554	0	a	She should see her
36555	0	a	PCP in two weeks.

36850	0	a	Dear Wilcox,
36851	0	a	     I saw Mr. Robison today.
36852	0	a	I hadn't seen him since last year.
36853	0	a	I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.
36854	0	a	He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth.
36855	0	a	His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).
36856	0	a	He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet.
36857	0	a	There is no tremor.
36858	0	a	His arms and legs are strong.
36859	0	a	Extraocular movements are full.
36860	0	a	The pupils are equal.
36861	0	a	There is no ptosis.
36862	0	a	His speech is fluent.
36863	40	a	He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).
36864	0	a	His blood pressure is 120/80.
36865	0	a	The pulse is around 76.
36866	0	a	There are no cervical bruits.
36867	40	a	From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.
36868	0	a	I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery.
36869	0	a	The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.
36870	0	a	The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.
36871	0	a	It may well be occluded with collateralization.
36872	0	a	The left imaging was in 2082.
36873	0	a	He is stable at this time.
36874	0	a	He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.
36875	0	a	Best regards,

36999	0	a	This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.
37000	0	a	Recommendations:
37001	43	a	-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100
37002	0	a	-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively
37003	0	a	-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID
37004	0	a	-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery.

37292	0	a	He was overweight and was placed on dietary therapy.
37293	15	a	"Per his own report his DM was diet controlled and ""seemed to disappear"" several years after initial diagnosis."
37294	0	a	Approximately 4 years ago he experienced blurry vision and was again noted to have elevated BGs (he is uncertain of the magnitude of the BG elevation).
37295	0	a	He resumed dietary therapy and has achieved good control with a  pre-op A1c of 6.2.

37328	59	a	He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.
37329	0	a	Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.
37330	0	a	The goal is to maintain BS<175.
37331	0	a	He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.
37332	0	a	At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.

37417	0	a	Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis
37418	0	a	HPI:
37419	0	a	27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.
37420	59	a	This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.
37421	0	a	At the time, blood sugar was >500.
37422	25	a	Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.
37423	58	a	The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
37424	0	a	At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
37425	0	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
37426	0	a	He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.
37427	0	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
37428	0	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
37429	0	a	Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.
37430	0	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
37431	28	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
37432	0	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
37433	0	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
37434	0	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
37435	0	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
37436	0	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.
37437	0	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
37438	0	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
37439	0	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
37440	0	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
37441	0	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
37442	0	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
37443	0	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
37444	40	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
37445	0	a	He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.
37446	0	a	His energy has been good.
37447	0	a	He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.
37448	0	a	No bleeding/bruising.
37449	0	a	No further swelling in his arms/legs.
37450	0	a	He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.

37496	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
37497	27	a	Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
37498	0	a	He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
37499	0	a	Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.
37500	0	a	It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
37501	40	a	At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.
37502	0	a	If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.
37503	0	a	At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.
37504	0	a	If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.
37505	0	a	Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.
37506	0	a	In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

37794	0	a	Dear Dr. Patton:
37795	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
37796	0	a	his coronary artery
37797	0	a	disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.
37798	0	a	As you know, this is a 
37799	0	a	63-year-old male with a
37800	15	a	long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 
37801	0	a	peripheral vascular
37802	28	a	disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 
37803	0	a	diagnosed
37804	0	a	esophageal carcinoma.
37805	0	a	He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 
37806	0	a	Landers, for the last nine
37807	0	a	years.
37808	0	a	Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
37809	0	a	artery disease which is
37810	0	a	documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
37811	0	a	The 
37812	0	a	catheterization demonstrated
37813	0	a	right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 
37814	0	a	and a 30%
37815	0	a	marginal 1 lesion.
37816	0	a	There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
37817	0	a	PDA and from the
37818	0	a	septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.
37819	0	a	procedure was
37820	0	a	performed through the right radial artery without complications.

37822	0	a	also has peripheral
37823	0	a	vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
37824	0	a	vein bypass graft in

37826	0	a	He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
37827	0	a	femoral to posterior
37828	0	a	tibial graft.
37829	0	a	He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.

37839	0	a	He reports 
37840	0	a	that he has had a
37841	0	a	positive stress test.
37842	0	a	Further information is not available.
37843	0	a	understands he has coronary
37844	0	a	disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.
37845	0	a	On 
37846	0	a	catheterization he had
37847	0	a	preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
37848	0	a	He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
37849	0	a	after receiving
37850	0	a	chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
37851	0	a	Patient states he will be

37856	0	a	catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 
37857	0	a	therapy.
37858	85	a	On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.
37859	0	a	His blood 
37860	0	a	pressure is 100/72,
37861	0	a	heart rate is 57 bpm.
37862	0	a	HEENT: oropharynx benign.
37863	0	a	Neck: carotids intact 
37864	0	a	bilaterally without
37865	0	a	audible bruits.
37866	0	a	Lungs: distant breath sounds.

37887	27	a	Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 
37888	0	a	artery disease and
37889	0	a	peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
37890	0	a	He 
37891	0	a	clearly has ischemia
37892	0	a	on a positive stress test.
37893	0	a	I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
37894	0	a	check ischemic
37895	0	a	threshold.
37896	0	a	He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
37897	0	a	event.
37898	0	a	However, given
37899	0	a	his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 
37900	0	a	surgery even
37901	0	a	understanding possible complications.
37902	0	a	Plan:
37903	0	a	1.
37904	0	a	Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
37905	0	a	2.
37906	0	a	Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
37907	0	a	control of
37908	0	a	     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 
37909	0	a	dobutamine
37910	0	a	     echocardiography.
37911	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael

38085	0	a	MR #45339844
38086	0	a	Dear Dr. Hodges:
38087	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario.
38088	0	a	This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and 
38089	0	a	congestive heart
38090	0	a	failure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid 
38091	0	a	endarterectomy and cardiac
38092	0	a	procedure.
38093	0	a	At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally 
38094	0	a	active because of the
38095	0	a	flooding.
38096	0	a	He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.
38097	0	a	He has had no exertional 
38098	0	a	neck, chest, arm
38099	0	a	or jaw pain.
38100	0	a	He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 
38101	0	a	activity and he does
38102	0	a	have mild lower extremity edema.
38103	40	a	His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, 
38104	69	a	simvastatin, Norvasc,
38105	58	a	Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.
38106	0	a	On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.
38107	0	a	His blood pressure is 
38108	0	a	124/60 right and left
38109	0	a	arm seated.
38110	0	a	His heart rate is 54 and regular.
38111	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
38112	0	a	There is a mild increase in
38113	0	a	jugular venous pressure.
38114	0	a	Carotids are without bruits.
38115	0	a	Lungs are actually 
38116	0	a	clear to auscultation
38117	0	a	throughout.
38118	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 
38119	0	a	but no gallop is
38120	0	a	present.
38121	0	a	His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.
38122	0	a	Extremities are
38123	0	a	notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 
38124	0	a	posterior tibialis and mild
38125	0	a	pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.
38126	0	a	His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  
38127	0	a	No significant
38128	0	a	change from prior electrocardiograms.
38129	0	a	In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the 
38130	0	a	present time.
38131	0	a	He reports
38132	0	a	that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.
38133	0	a	Before adjusting his 
38134	0	a	Demadex dosing, I will
38135	0	a	reassess his kidney profile.
38136	0	a	MR #45339844             -2-                 February 13, 2071
38137	0	a	If there are any other thoughts or questions in the care of this lovely 
38138	0	a	gentleman, please feel free
38139	0	a	to give me a call.
38140	0	a	Sincerely,

38562	17	a	A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.
38563	0	a	She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.
38564	0	a	This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.
38565	0	a	Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.
38566	0	a	In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.
38567	0	a	Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
38568	0	a	Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.
38569	0	a	Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.
38570	0	a	Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.
38571	0	a	Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.
38572	0	a	Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.
38573	0	a	However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.
38574	0	a	She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
38575	0	a	She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.
38576	0	a	Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.
38577	0	a	Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.
38578	0	a	However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.
38579	0	a	The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.
38580	0	a	Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.
38581	0	a	There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
38582	0	a	There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state
38583	0	a	Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.
38584	0	a	She had a recent stress test that was negative.
38585	0	a	However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.
38586	0	a	However, this would not cause the delirium.
38587	0	a	Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.
38588	0	a	Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.
38589	17	a	Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.

38691	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
38692	0	a	up.
38693	0	a	She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
38694	0	a	sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
38695	0	a	gets some pressure in her chest.
38696	0	a	She gets a slight shortness of 
38697	0	a	breath.
38698	0	a	It lasts 30 seconds.
38699	0	a	She gets as many as three or four 
38700	0	a	a day.
38701	0	a	The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
38702	0	a	better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.
38703	0	a	I think 
38704	0	a	weight loss is going to be critical.
38705	0	a	She also is less fatigued 
38706	0	a	as she begins to lose weight.
38707	28	a	Her hypertension has been under better control.
38708	48	a	Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
38709	44	a	to the atenolol.
38710	26	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.
38711	0	a	Weight has gone 
38712	0	a	from 200 to 196 pounds.
38713	0	a	Respiratory rate is 20.
38714	0	a	Pulse is 64.
38715	0	a	Neck is supple.
38716	0	a	There is no lymphadenopathy.
38717	0	a	Chest is clear to 
38718	0	a	percussion and auscultation.
38719	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
38720	0	a	with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
38721	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
38722	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
38723	0	a	Extremities are clear of 
38724	0	a	cyanosis, clubbing and edema.
38725	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.
38726	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
38727	0	a	1.
38728	0	a	Hypertension.
38729	0	a	Relatively well controlled on 
38730	44	a	hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
38731	0	a	2.
38732	0	a	Weight.
38733	0	a	Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
38734	0	a	better as a result of it.
38735	0	a	3.
38736	0	a	Peculiar chest pressure.
38737	0	a	I do not think she has coronary 
38738	0	a	artery disease given the exercise test.
38739	0	a	In light of this, 
38740	0	a	we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
38741	0	a	lose some weight.
38742	0	a	Hopefully, this will help with the 
38743	0	a	resolution of her symptoms.

38898	57	a	1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO

38900	57	a	3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

39124	0	a	     MR #892-76-95-4
39125	0	a	Dear Usha:
39126	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
39127	0	a	Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
39128	28	a	hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
39129	0	a	As
39130	0	a	you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night.
39131	0	a	She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
39132	0	a	whenever she takes the quinine.
39133	0	a	She has not been taking this since
39134	0	a	the initial two doses.
39135	0	a	I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
39136	0	a	secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.
39137	0	a	I have told her to eat
39138	0	a	a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
39139	0	a	cramps in the evening.
39140	0	a	In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
39141	0	a	bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.
39142	0	a	There is borderline first
39143	0	a	degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
39144	0	a	from previous tracing.
39145	32	a	We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
39146	42	a	as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.
39147	0	a	She will see me in follow-up in
39148	0	a	three months' time.
39149	0	a	Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
39150	0	a	clinic.
39151	0	a	With warm regards.

39164	90	a	Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
39165	15	a	diagnosed type II diabetes.
39166	0	a	He has been very compliant with his 
39167	62	a	medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
39168	0	a	and NPH 
39169	58	a	insulin subQ q.AM.
39170	0	a	He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
39171	0	a	check his blood sugar at the time.
39172	0	a	He has not had any frank 
39173	0	a	palpitations or lightheadedness.
39174	0	a	He did have 1 episode where he had the 
39175	0	a	sensation of several extra heart beats.
39176	0	a	This was not accompanied by 
39177	0	a	other symptoms including no chest pain.
39178	0	a	He has never had a fingerstick 
39179	0	a	blood glucose below the mid 150's.
39180	0	a	I am looking through his log and see 
39181	0	a	that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
39182	0	a	dinner they have been between 157-296.
39183	0	a	He has already met several times 
39184	15	a	with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
39185	0	a	therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
39186	0	a	diabetic diet.
39187	0	a	On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
39188	0	a	pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
39189	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars.
39190	0	a	I will increase his 
39191	58	a	insulin regimen.
39192	0	a	He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
39193	58	a	new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
39194	0	a	before bedtime.
39195	62	a	And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
39196	0	a	and 
39197	0	a	I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
39198	0	a	syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.
39199	0	a	He is to follow up with me in 
39200	0	a	several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.
39201	0	a	I have 
39202	0	a	advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
39203	0	a	his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
39204	0	a	symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
39205	0	a	at that time as well.

39223	0	a	Most
39224	0	a	importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.
39225	0	a	He
39226	0	a	has been quite depressed about this.
39227	0	a	His medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d., prednisone 6
39228	47	a	q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 q.d., Cardura 4 mg.
39229	0	a	q.d.,
39230	70	a	Pravachol 40 mg.
39231	0	a	q.d., Axid 150 b.i.d., Calcium, vitamin C and D,
39232	0	a	Mag.
39233	58	a	Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.
39234	0	a	On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.
39235	0	a	had a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was
39236	0	a	309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.
39237	0	a	Chest was
39238	0	a	clear to auscultation.
39239	0	a	Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30
39240	0	a	degrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs,
39241	0	a	rubs or gallops.
39242	0	a	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
39243	0	a	Abdomen was soft, nontender.
39244	0	a	There is no organomegaly, no
39245	0	a	hepatojugular reflux.
39246	0	a	Extremities without edema.
39247	0	a	Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90.
39248	0	a	Intervals of .16/.08/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees.
39249	0	a	This is a
39250	0	a	normal tracing and unchanged from his previous tracing on 9/20/86.Edwin Workman
39251	0	a	#612-48-04-0                  - 2 -          November 09, 2086
39252	0	a	Therefore, Mr. Workman is stable at this time from a cardiac
39253	0	a	perspective.
39254	0	a	We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
39255	0	a	regimen according to his laboratory results.
39256	0	a	Best regards.

39266	0	a	This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
39267	15	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
39268	84	a	obesity.
39269	0	a	Her problems are as follows:
39270	0	a	1.
39271	0	a	Diabetes.
39272	0	a	She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
39273	57	a	     and she was put on insulin by me.
39274	0	a	Xitlali Xia followed her in 
39275	0	a	     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
39276	0	a	     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.
39277	0	a	She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
39278	0	a	     list of her blood sugars.
39279	0	a	She says she does take them about twice a 
39280	0	a	     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
39281	0	a	     threw them away.
39282	0	a	She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
39283	0	a	     they usually are about 110.
39284	0	a	It was 101 this morning before 
39285	0	a	     breakfast, she says.
39286	0	a	She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
39287	0	a	     six times it has been below 50.
39288	0	a	She does say she eats three regular 
39289	0	a	     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
39290	0	a	     breakfast she said no.
39291	0	a	She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
39292	0	a	I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.
39293	0	a	I expressed to her again how 
39294	0	a	     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.
39295	0	a	She had been eating a lot of chocolate.
39296	0	a	She says she has gotten off 
39297	0	a	     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
39298	0	a	     then.
39299	0	a	She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
39300	0	a	     help her with her diet.
39301	0	a	If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
39302	57	a	     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.
39303	0	a	I explained to her, too, 
39304	0	a	     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
39305	58	a	     be able to get her off the insulin.
39306	0	a	This seemed to be something that 
39307	0	a	     she would like to do.
39308	0	a	Hopefully the nutritionist can help.
39309	0	a	I also 
39310	0	a	     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
39311	0	a	     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
39312	0	a	     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
39313	0	a	     really going on and whether they are getting too low.
39314	0	a	She denies any 
39315	0	a	     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.
39316	0	a	I am 
39317	0	a	     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.
39318	0	a	She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
39319	0	a	     nothing.
39320	0	a	She felt totally normal.
39321	0	a	So hopefully she will really 
39322	0	a	     record these and we will get a better idea.
39323	0	a	She said this always 
39324	0	a	     happens in the morning.
39325	0	a	She kept contradicting herself and had no 
39326	0	a	     documentation.
39327	0	a	I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
39328	0	a	Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.
39329	0	a	She does drink juice, 
39330	0	a	     but I went over the symptoms again with her.
39331	0	a	She will call me if she 
39332	0	a	     does have any.
39333	0	a	10-19-86
39334	0	a	2.
39335	0	a	Left ankle pain.
39336	0	a	I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.
39337	0	a	She said that she may do some surgery on her.
39338	0	a	3.
39339	0	a	Dysuria.
39340	0	a	She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
39341	0	a	     Bactrim.
39342	0	a	4.
39343	0	a	Yeast infection.
39344	0	a	She said this has also resolved.
39345	0	a	5.
39346	0	a	She complains of headache.
39347	0	a	She says these have been going on for two 
39348	0	a	     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.
39349	0	a	She has had nausea and vomited once.
39350	0	a	This happened pretty much every 
39351	0	a	     day and it can be at any time of the day.
39352	0	a	Tylenol and Advil did not 
39353	0	a	     help.
39354	0	a	She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
39355	0	a	     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.
39356	0	a	But she has no further prodrome.
39357	0	a	She says it is a banging kind of 
39358	0	a	     pain that is rhythmic.
39359	0	a	She also says she does see stars in front of 
39360	0	a	     her eyes when it happens.
39361	0	a	I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
39362	0	a	     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
39363	0	a	     sometimes.
39364	0	a	It has been happening for a couple of weeks.
39365	0	a	I discussed 
39366	0	a	     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
39367	0	a	     migraines.
39368	0	a	I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
39369	0	a	     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.
39370	0	a	Her neuro exam 
39371	0	a	     was totally normal.
39372	0	a	Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.
39373	0	a	Her gait was normal.
39374	0	a	Light touch was touched.
39375	0	a	Her toes were 
39376	0	a	     downgoing.
39377	0	a	Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.
39378	0	a	Her disks were 
39379	0	a	     sharp.
39380	0	a	EOMI, PERRL.
39381	0	a	I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
39382	0	a	     t.i.d.
39383	0	a	and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
39384	0	a	     her left ear.
39385	0	a	I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
39386	0	a	6.
39387	0	a	Health maintenance.
39388	0	a	I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
39389	0	a	     that she might benefit from a flu shot.
39390	0	a	She has no interest in this 
39391	0	a	     at all.
39392	0	a	Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
39393	0	a	     cuff.
39394	0	a	Her pulse was 96.
39395	0	a	Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
39396	0	a	     285.

39411	0	a	Dear Dr. Peralta:
39412	0	a	I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.
39413	0	a	He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.
39414	0	a	His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.
39415	0	a	He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.
39416	0	a	He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.
39417	0	a	He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.
39418	0	a	He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.
39419	0	a	He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.
39420	0	a	Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.
39421	0	a	We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.
39422	0	a	He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.
39423	0	a	He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.
39424	0	a	The discomfort resolved into recovery.
39425	0	a	He had no ST segment changes.
39426	0	a	His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.
39427	0	a	There was normal RV size as well.
39428	0	a	There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.
39429	0	a	These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.
39430	0	a	As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.
39431	40	a	His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.
39432	0	a	On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.
39433	0	a	Head and neck are unremarkable.
39434	0	a	Chest is clear.
39435	0	a	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
39436	0	a	PMI is normal.
39437	0	a	S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
39438	0	a	There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
39439	0	a	Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
39440	0	a	Bowel sounds are normal.
39441	0	a	The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
39442	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
39443	0	a	Distal pulses are normal.
39444	0	a	His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.
39445	0	a	I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.
39446	0	a	I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.
39447	0	a	I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.
39448	0	a	His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.
39449	0	a	I think we can maintain our current approach.
39450	0	a	I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.
39451	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
39452	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
39453	0	a	Kindest regards.
39454	0	a	Sincerely yours,

39873	0	a	A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.
39874	0	a	An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.
39875	0	a	In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.

39931	0	a	Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar 
39932	0	a	control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects 
39933	0	a	on her living situation.
39934	0	a	PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post 
39935	0	a	renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a 
39936	0	a	mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair 
39937	0	a	and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been 
39938	0	a	treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.
39939	0	a	She also is 
39940	16	a	insulin-dependent diabetic.

39960	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
39961	0	a	more active.
39962	0	a	She is able to walk around her house without her walker.
39963	0	a	She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.
39964	0	a	She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and 
39965	0	a	preparing meals.
39966	0	a	She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with 
39967	0	a	managing her medications.
39968	0	a	She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
39969	0	a	her with this.
39970	0	a	She has not been out of the house much in the last 
39971	0	a	several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to 
39972	0	a	get behind the wheel.
39973	0	a	The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of 
39974	0	a	breath, no change in her bowel or bladder.
39975	0	a	HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite 
39976	0	a	has been good.
39977	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
39978	0	a	with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.
39979	0	a	Her weight is 104 lbs.
39980	0	a	Her blood pressure today is 130/72.
39981	0	a	Her pulse is 80 and regular today.
39982	0	a	She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.
39983	0	a	IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
39984	0	a	her current regimen and medications.
39985	0	a	We have been manipulating her 
39986	0	a	32 Weld St                             Bird, Terri
39987	0	a	Page 2
39988	0	a	Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 
39989	0	a	2.5, earlier this week.
39990	0	a	She will continue on her current medications, 
39991	0	a	as noted above.
39992	0	a	The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
39993	0	a	mental status.
39994	0	a	She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
39995	0	a	over the last several months.
39996	0	a	She is anxious to drive.
39997	0	a	However, 
39998	0	a	everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
39999	0	a	nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.
40000	0	a	I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in 
40001	0	a	management of her own medications.
40002	0	a	Hence, our three goals that we set 
40003	0	a	today were:
40004	0	a	Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing 
40005	0	a	     six months ago.
40006	0	a	To get out of the house at least once a week, using either 
40007	0	a	     community transportation or a family member.
40008	0	a	To be doing the family's laundry each week.
40009	0	a	While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
40010	0	a	drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that 
40011	0	a	we set.
40012	0	a	Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing 
40013	0	a	with these goals.
40014	0	a	As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse 
40015	0	a	see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

40200	15	a	Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis
40201	17	a	HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22.
40202	0	a	Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080.
40203	0	a	Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes.
40204	57	a	Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.
40205	57	a	After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid.
40206	11	a	HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081.
40207	0	a	On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting.
40208	0	a	Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her.
40209	57	a	Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID.
40210	0	a	Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease.
40211	0	a	Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial.
40212	0	a	She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
40213	0	a	She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management.
40214	57	a	On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID.
40215	0	a	Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse.
40216	0	a	Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse.
40217	0	a	Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.
40218	57	a	Written only for insulin sliding scale.
40219	0	a	Glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.

40316	57	a	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started.
40317	0	a	If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.
40318	57	a	"c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:"
40319	0	a	"i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units."
40320	57	a	"d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner."
40321	0	a	Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
40322	0	a	She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
40323	60	a	"e.	No metformin for now given GI upset."
40324	0	a	"2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace."

40326	0	a	Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina.
40327	0	a	Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
40328	0	a	I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.

40348	0	a	HPI:
40349	0	a	Ms. Edgar is a 64 year-old frequently hospitalized woman with CHFpEF (EF = 71%), COPD on 2.5L home O2 and chronic steroids (currently 10 mg prednisone), OSA on BiPAP, CKD, and chronic pain on chronic narcotics, who presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum after recently being treated for influenza.
40350	0	a	According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum.
40351	0	a	No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.
40352	0	a	Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.
40353	0	a	She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.
40354	0	a	This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).
40355	0	a	On interview she is tearful regarding her readmission, stating that she &#8220;tries so hard&#8221; to stay out of the hospital, &#8220;but what am I supposed to do when I am sick?&#8221;
40356	0	a	ED Course:
40357	0	a	In the ED, a CXR showed a RLL patchy opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
40358	0	a	She received 750 mg levofloxacin, 1 g vancomycin, nebulizer treatments, and morphine for pain control.

40743	0	a	Dear Dr. Stafford:
40744	0	a	     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
40745	0	a	Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
40746	0	a	as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
40747	0	a	In summary, she is
40748	16	a	a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
40749	0	a	since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.
40750	0	a	By
40751	17	a	report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
40752	0	a	peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.
40753	0	a	In viewing
40754	0	a	her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.
40755	0	a	Her
40756	0	a	three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
40757	0	a	She does,
40758	0	a	however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
40759	7	a	on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
40760	0	a	These episodes are
40761	4	a	relieved by nitroglycerin.
40762	0	a	Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
40763	0	a	walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
40764	0	a	by slowing down.
40765	28	a	In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
40766	86	a	only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.
40767	0	a	cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.
40768	0	a	I don't have
40769	0	a	fractionations and her family history is unknown.
40770	0	a	A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
40771	0	a	ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
40772	0	a	preserved LV size and function.
40773	0	a	She had an exercise tolerance test
40774	0	a	in February of 2085.
40775	0	a	On a modified protocol, she went for less
40776	0	a	than 4 1/2 minutes.
40777	0	a	This is equivalent to not even completing
40778	0	a	stage 1 of the standard Bruce.
40779	0	a	With that, she did develop chest
40780	0	a	pain and had 2 mm of ST depression.
40781	0	a	That study was accompanied by
40782	0	a	both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
40783	0	a	consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
40784	0	a	ischemia.
40785	0	a	As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
40786	3	a	portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
40787	0	a	to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
40788	0	a	That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
40789	0	a	only have the report.
40790	0	a	However, from this report, there was
40791	0	a	preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
40792	0	a	MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
40793	0	a	Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
40794	0	a	proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
40795	0	a	LAD.
40796	0	a	The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
40797	0	a	discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
40798	0	a	The
40799	0	a	right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
40800	0	a	stenosis.
40801	0	a	At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
40802	0	a	therapy.
40803	0	a	Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
40804	40	a	prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
40805	0	a	other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
40806	57	a	daily insulin therapy.
40807	0	a	In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
40808	0	a	have involved the hemodialysis access.
40809	0	a	She has had one pregnancy
40810	0	a	28 years ago without complications.
40811	0	a	I also elicited a history of
40812	0	a	some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
40813	0	a	This
40814	0	a	was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
40815	26	a	On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
40816	0	a	regular, her weight 95 lbs.
40817	0	a	Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
40818	0	a	arm.
40819	0	a	There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
40820	0	a	distended.
40821	0	a	Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained.
40822	0	a	There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
40823	0	a	apex.
40824	0	a	Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
40825	0	a	were without edema.
40826	0	a	The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
40827	0	a	diffuse STT changes.
40828	0	a	There were no pathologic Q waves.
40829	0	a	Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
40830	0	a	transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
40831	0	a	status.
40832	16	a	She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
40833	0	a	shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
40834	0	a	limited functional capacity.
40835	0	a	The coronary angiography reveals a
40836	0	a	presence of multi-vessel disease.
40837	0	a	Even without seeing the primary
40838	0	a	data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
40839	16	a	she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.
40840	0	a	Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
40841	0	a	bypass surgery.
40842	0	a	Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
40843	7	a	with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.
40844	0	a	I
40845	0	a	would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
40846	0	a	10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.
40847	0	a	As
40848	0	a	indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
40849	0	a	suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
40850	3	a	symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
40851	0	a	pressing.
40852	0	a	I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
40853	0	a	her care.
40854	0	a	Sincerely,

41531	0	a	Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.

41533	0	a	make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.
41534	0	a	Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans

41536	0	a	Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
41537	0	a	&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)

41590	0	a	Today on exam, she is afebrile.
41591	0	a	There was OA involving the DIP joints.
41592	0	a	PIPs 
41593	0	a	and MCPs were nontender.
41594	0	a	The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
41595	0	a	diminished motion.
41596	0	a	Right wrist showed full range of motion.
41597	0	a	Elbows, 
41598	0	a	shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.
41599	0	a	There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.
41600	0	a	I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.
41601	0	a	No fluid was obtained.
41602	0	a	I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.
41603	0	a	Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.
41604	0	a	She has chondrocalcinosis on 
41605	0	a	radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.
41606	0	a	In 
41607	0	a	addition, she has primary Sjogren's.
41608	0	a	The two diseases are unrelated.
41609	0	a	In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 
41610	0	a	200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.
41611	0	a	She should probably 
41612	0	a	take that for about five to seven days.
41613	0	a	Side effects were reviewed.
41614	0	a	I would like to see her back in four months.
41615	0	a	She will be returning to you 
41616	0	a	for further care in the interim.
41617	0	a	Page 2
41618	0	a	ADDENDUM:  At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and 
41619	0	a	thyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.

41635	0	a	September 28, 2085
41636	0	a	Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085.
41637	0	a	Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.
41638	0	a	In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.
41639	0	a	She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.
41640	27	a	She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.
41641	49	a	Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.
41642	49	a	Triamterene was added.
41643	0	a	Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.
41644	0	a	Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.
41645	0	a	She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.
41646	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.
41647	0	a	She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.
41648	0	a	Yamilex is generally doing well.
41649	0	a	She has no particular complaints.
41650	0	a	She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.
41651	0	a	She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.
41652	0	a	Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d.
41653	44	a	for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.
41654	26	a	Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.
41655	0	a	Heart rate was 82 and regular.
41656	0	a	The HEENT examination was unremarkable.
41657	0	a	Neck was supple without adenopathy.
41658	0	a	There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.
41659	0	a	Chest was clear to auscultation.
41660	0	a	Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.
41661	0	a	Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.
41662	0	a	Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.
41663	0	a	Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.
41664	0	a	Assessment and plan: 
41665	0	a	1.
41666	28	a	Hypertension.
41667	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.
41668	28	a	She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.
41669	44	a	I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.
41670	0	a	2.
41671	0	a	Neurologic.
41672	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.
41673	0	a	She will continue on Coumadin.
41674	0	a	I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.
41675	0	a	3.
41676	0	a	Primary care issues.
41677	0	a	Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.
41678	0	a	I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.
41679	0	a	I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.
41680	0	a	I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.
41681	0	a	I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.
41682	0	a	The patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D.

41767	0	a	History of sleep apnea.
41768	0	a	The patient has significant fatigue.
41769	0	a	This may be due to her sleep apnea.
41770	0	a	In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.
41771	0	a	I discussed this with her today.
41772	0	a	I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.
41773	0	a	She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.
41774	0	a	She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

42376	0	a	Dear Dr. Knapp:
42377	0	a	It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.
42378	0	a	He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.
42379	0	a	In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.
42380	0	a	He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.
42381	28	a	His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.
42382	0	a	During his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm.
42383	0	a	His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure.
42384	0	a	After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35.
42385	67	a	He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil.
42386	67	a	The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.
42387	0	a	There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.
42388	0	a	His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.
42389	67	a	The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.
42390	0	a	He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.
42391	0	a	At the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.
42392	65	a	His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
42393	0	a	b.i.d.
42394	44	a	He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.
42395	32	a	His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation.
42396	69	a	He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.
42397	0	a	His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm.
42398	0	a	His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.
42399	0	a	It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.
42400	0	a	He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family.
42401	0	a	We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.
42402	0	a	He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care.
42403	0	a	I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.
42404	0	a	Sincerely,

42421	0	a	   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today.
42422	0	a	His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test.
42423	0	a	He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.
42424	9	a	His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia.
42425	0	a	He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.
42426	0	a	Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.
42427	0	a	Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.
42428	0	a	"He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol."
42429	0	a	The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week.
42430	0	a	He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different.
42431	0	a	He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.
42432	0	a	He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.

42463	0	a	I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise.
42464	0	a	We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.
42465	0	a	We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.
42466	0	a	The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

42482	15	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.
42483	11	a	I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.
42484	15	a	So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.
42485	0	a	We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.
42486	76	a	These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.
42487	15	a	He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.
42488	0	a	He had no other complaints.
42489	0	a	His bowel movements are regular.
42490	0	a	He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.

42731	0	a	Dear Dr Chavez,
42732	0	a	Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.
42733	0	a	He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home.
42734	0	a	He has not sustained any significant injuries.
42735	0	a	He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.
42736	40	a	Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.
42737	0	a	Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.
42738	0	a	He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.
42739	0	a	Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.
42740	0	a	Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet.
42741	0	a	Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.
42742	0	a	Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.
42743	0	a	This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162.
42744	0	a	This most likely is a MGUS.
42745	15	a	Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.
42746	0	a	The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.
42747	0	a	Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.
42748	0	a	He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.
42749	0	a	I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control.

43161	0	a	     MRN: 89276954
43162	0	a	Dear Usha:
43163	0	a	I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up
43164	0	a	cardiovascular examination.
43165	0	a	She has been reasonably stable since
43166	0	a	I saw her last in July.
43167	0	a	She has had several episodes of chest
43168	0	a	discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite
43169	0	a	transient.
43170	0	a	The frequency has been less than one time per month.
43171	0	a	The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping
43172	0	a	mall.
43173	0	a	She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
43174	0	a	She has
43175	0	a	not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
43176	0	a	She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying
43177	0	a	transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.
43178	0	a	She
43179	0	a	denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip
43180	0	a	pain with walking.
43181	0	a	She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
43182	0	a	She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.
43183	35	a	Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o.
43184	0	a	b.i.d.,
43185	46	a	nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o.
43186	40	a	q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.

43199	0	a	q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.
43200	0	a	and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
43201	0	a	p.r.n.
43202	0	a	On examination she appears well.
43203	0	a	Weight is 142 pounds.
43204	0	a	Blood
43205	0	a	pressure is 140/60.
43206	0	a	Heart rate is 50 and regular.
43207	0	a	Neck veins
43208	0	a	are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.
43209	0	a	There are bilateral carotid
43210	0	a	bruits.
43211	0	a	Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to
43212	0	a	auscultation.
43213	0	a	On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth
43214	0	a	intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
43215	0	a	There is a 1+ left
43216	0	a	ventricular lift.
43217	0	a	The first heart sound is normal.
43218	0	a	The second 
43219	0	a	Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954
43220	0	a	November 07, 2086              -2-
43221	0	a	is split physiologically.
43222	0	a	There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic
43223	0	a	murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along
43224	0	a	the left sternal border.
43225	0	a	There is a fourth heart sound at the
43226	0	a	apex.
43227	0	a	Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no
43228	0	a	hepatosplenomegaly.
43229	0	a	Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral
43230	0	a	femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft
43231	0	a	pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis
43232	0	a	pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal
43233	0	a	pulses.
43234	0	a	Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
43235	0	a	AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral
43236	0	a	myocardial infarction.
43237	0	a	There has been no diagnostic change since
43238	0	a	July 18, 2086.
43239	0	a	Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,
43240	0	a	2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
43241	0	a	and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
43242	0	a	The
43243	0	a	velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
43244	0	a	calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
43245	0	a	2086.
43246	0	a	Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left
43247	0	a	femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
43248	0	a	velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
43249	0	a	thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.
43250	0	a	The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent
43251	0	a	with no evidence of significant stenoses.
43252	0	a	In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:
43253	0	a	1.
43254	4	a	Coronary artery disease.
43255	0	a	Status post coronary artery bypass
43256	0	a	surgery.
43257	0	a	LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and
43258	0	a	posterolateral left ventricular branch.
43259	0	a	She has occasional and
43260	7	a	very transient episodes of angina.
43261	0	a	I have suggested continuing
43262	0	a	her current medical regimen.
43263	0	a	As noted previously, I prefer to
43264	0	a	manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.
43265	0	a	2.
43266	0	a	Carotid artery disease.
43267	0	a	She is asymptomatic.
43268	0	a	I recommend
43269	0	a	periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.
43270	0	a	3.
43271	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease.
43272	0	a	Both grafts are patent but the
43273	0	a	left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have
43274	0	a	a significant stenosis.
43275	0	a	I have asked her to discuss this finding
43276	0	a	with you further.
43277	0	a	November 07, 2086              -3-
43278	0	a	4.
43279	22	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
43280	0	a	A lipid profile will be checked today.
43281	0	a	5.
43282	0	a	Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental
43283	0	a	procedures.
43284	0	a	I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably
43285	0	a	aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an
43286	0	a	echocardiogram.

43431	0	a	Dear Dr. Nunes:
43432	0	a	Thank you for asking me to see Mr.
43433	0	a	Craft.
43434	0	a	Patient says he was diagnosed 
43435	0	a	as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
43436	0	a	Xian and was treated with steroids at the time.
43437	0	a	It's not clear what CNS 
43438	0	a	or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time.
43439	0	a	Because of complex 
43440	0	a	partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
43441	0	a	referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
43442	0	a	estradiol level was in the 80s.
43443	0	a	His testosterone was up but available 
43444	0	a	testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
43445	0	a	said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures.
43446	0	a	Said he was doing 
43447	0	a	fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred.
43448	0	a	He 
43449	0	a	said his neck felt full and warm.
43450	0	a	His head felt like it was going to 
43451	0	a	explode.
43452	0	a	He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
43453	0	a	vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
43454	0	a	right.
43455	0	a	Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
43456	0	a	postnasal drip.
43457	0	a	Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
43458	0	a	anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
43459	0	a	other results).
43460	0	a	He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
43461	0	a	on his legs.
43462	0	a	No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
43463	0	a	or gum except that he has to wear his glasses.
43464	0	a	Recently had some teeth 
43465	0	a	removed.
43466	0	a	Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough.
43467	0	a	No other 
43468	28	a	cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension.
43469	0	a	No GI 
43470	0	a	problems.
43471	0	a	Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
43472	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR.

43509	0	a	Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on

43511	0	a	One

43523	0	a	Extremity, joint exam fine.
43524	0	a	Neurological fine.
43525	0	a	I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
43526	0	a	symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection.
43527	0	a	However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
43528	0	a	and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
43529	0	a	also exclude lupus and vasculitis.
43530	0	a	Basically I told him to take Flonase 
43531	0	a	twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
43532	0	a	cleared up.
43533	0	a	In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
43534	0	a	stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
43535	0	a	testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
43536	0	a	testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
43537	31	a	estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
43538	28	a	hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain.
43539	0	a	Patient 
43540	0	a	also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
43541	0	a	regarding increased appetite, decreased memory, 
43542	0	a	Page 3
43543	0	a	decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
43544	0	a	hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
43545	0	a	cholinergic transmission problems.
43546	0	a	Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
43547	0	a	Aricept to improve his memory.
43548	0	a	Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
43549	0	a	for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted.
43550	0	a	Thank you again for asking me to see him.

43649	90	a	Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
43650	0	a	blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.
43651	0	a	I have been 
43652	90	a	readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
43653	0	a	several months ago.
43654	49	a	His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
43655	32	a	q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d.
43656	42	a	and atenolol 25mg q.d.
43657	0	a	He apparently went 
43658	0	a	to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
43659	28	a	to have high blood pressure.
43660	43	a	She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
43661	0	a	from 25mg to 50mg.
43662	0	a	He has not yet completed that prescription.
43663	90	a	Mr. 
43664	26	a	Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.
43665	0	a	He denies any recent chest 
43666	0	a	pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.
43667	90	a	Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
43668	0	a	elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.
43669	0	a	His 
43670	19	a	current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  
43671	90	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
43672	0	a	headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
43673	0	a	diarrhea, dysuria.
43674	26	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.
43675	0	a	His weight is 184.
43676	0	a	His heart rate is 80.
43677	0	a	Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
43678	0	a	The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
43679	0	a	murmurs.
43680	0	a	Abdominal exam is benign.
43681	0	a	Extremities show no evidence of 
43682	0	a	edema.
43683	0	a	Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
43684	0	a	chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.
43685	0	a	He has a 
43686	0	a	normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.
43687	0	a	His T4 is 
43688	0	a	normal at 10.3.
43689	0	a	His THBR is normal at 0.98.

43693	90	a	Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
43694	43	a	     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.
43695	43	a	He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.
43696	0	a	I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
43697	0	a	     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
43698	0	a	     few weeks for blood pressure check.
43699	0	a	2.
43700	23	a	Cholesterol.
43701	0	a	The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.
43702	0	a	Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
43703	0	a	     130.
43704	68	a	Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.
43705	0	a	His current 
43706	0	a	     liver function tests are normal.

43742	0	a	HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
43743	28	a	diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
43744	0	a	checkup.
43745	0	a	Patient appears to be doing fine.
43746	0	a	She has been compliant with her 
43747	46	a	antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
43748	49	a	hydrochlorothiazide.
43749	0	a	Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
43750	0	a	approximately 15 to 20 pounds.
43751	0	a	She has been exercising on a daily basis 
43752	0	a	and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
43753	0	a	beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
43754	0	a	was 120/80 in both arms.
43755	0	a	The patient was complaining of some ankle 
43756	0	a	swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
43757	0	a	on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
43758	0	a	admission.
43759	49	a	I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
43760	0	a	I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
43761	0	a	symptoms over the next few days.
43762	0	a	The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
43763	0	a	chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065.
43764	0	a	We 
43765	0	a	have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
43766	0	a	rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises.
43767	0	a	The 
43768	0	a	patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
43769	0	a	services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain.
43770	0	a	Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming.
43771	0	a	Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
43772	0	a	ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
43773	0	a	agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
43774	0	a	either a mammogram or a Pap smear.
43775	0	a	She complains that she does not have 
43776	0	a	faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
43777	0	a	to and does not want to have done.
43778	0	a	I attempted to discuss the need and why 
43779	0	a	it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
43780	0	a	this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
43781	0	a	refuses either of the two examinations.

43796	0	a	HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.
43797	0	a	The 
43798	0	a	patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
43799	3	a	whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
43800	1	a	"which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of "
43801	28	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.
43802	0	a	As it 
43803	0	a	turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
43804	0	a	beneficial effects of which were unknown.
43805	0	a	We had decided as of our last 
43806	0	a	meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.
43807	0	a	patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
43808	0	a	continue to discontinue this medicine.
43809	0	a	At this point, the patient does 
43810	0	a	not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.
43811	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
43812	0	a	the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
43813	0	a	wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.
43814	0	a	Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.
43815	0	a	It is 
43816	26	a	noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
43817	25	a	the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
43818	0	a	diastolic was 80-90.
43819	0	a	The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
43820	0	a	than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.
43821	0	a	The patient 
43822	0	a	has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
43823	0	a	ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
43824	0	a	remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.
43825	0	a	The patient's 
43826	0	a	cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.
43827	0	a	Review 
43828	0	a	of systems otherwise negative.
43829	0	a	Physical exam is not performed at this time.
43830	26	a	Blood pressure was 152/76 
43831	0	a	on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
43832	0	a	and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
43833	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
43834	0	a	problems coming in for follow-up.
43835	0	a	1.
43836	31	a	Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
43837	28	a	     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
43838	0	a	     hypertrophy.
43839	0	a	The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
43840	0	a	     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
43841	0	a	     standing.
43842	0	a	The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
43843	0	a	     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
43844	0	a	     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.
43845	0	a	If 
43846	0	a	     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
43847	0	a	     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
43848	0	a	2.
43849	0	a	BPH - please see above.
43850	0	a	The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
43851	0	a	3.   ?
43852	3	a	coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
43853	0	a	     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
43854	0	a	     for this gentleman.
43855	0	a	I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
43856	0	a	     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s 
43857	0	a	     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL
43858	0	a	476 Will St                           Vicente, Kadeem
43859	0	a	PAGE 2
43860	0	a	     or low 50s.
43861	0	a	Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
43862	0	a	     therapy.
43863	0	a	I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
43864	0	a	     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
43865	0	a	     will be put on an antilipid drug.
43866	0	a	4.
43867	0	a	GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
43868	0	a	     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
43869	0	a	     point.
43870	0	a	Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
43871	0	a	     placed on Prilosec.
43872	0	a	I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
43873	0	a	his use of Hytrin.

44263	0	a	RE:Fair, Bill
44264	0	a	MR#:220-41-86-4
44265	0	a	Dear Dr. Keys:
44266	0	a	Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 
44267	0	a	right knee.
44268	0	a	As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.
44269	0	a	He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 
44270	0	a	mainly related to sports injuries.
44271	0	a	He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.
44272	0	a	It got so 
44273	0	a	bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that.
44274	0	a	It has slowly got better since then.
44275	0	a	At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 
44276	0	a	activity but he also has rest and night pain.
44277	0	a	He has a restricted walking 
44278	0	a	distance.
44279	0	a	With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 
44280	0	a	requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.
44281	0	a	He has 
44282	0	a	noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.
44283	0	a	With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 
44284	0	a	Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 
44285	0	a	have a colonoscopy in the near future.
44286	0	a	He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.
44287	0	a	On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 
44288	0	a	the left.
44289	0	a	He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.
44290	0	a	He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 
44291	0	a	arthritis.
44292	0	a	He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 
44293	0	a	degrees.
44294	0	a	His varus deformity is not fully correctable.
44295	0	a	He has grade 5 
44296	0	a	quadriceps power.
44297	0	a	X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 
44298	0	a	obliteration of joint space on the right side.
44299	0	a	I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 
44300	0	a	arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.
44301	0	a	We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 
44302	0	a	osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement.
44303	0	a	At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 
44304	0	a	enough to warrant operative intervention.
44305	0	a	We would certainly reconsider 
44306	0	a	should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 
44307	0	a	instilling some corticosteroids.
44308	0	a	We have advised him that this will only 
44309	0	a	provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 
44310	0	a	some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.
44311	0	a	We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 
44312	0	a	reassess him.
44313	0	a	Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 
44314	0	a	ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 
44315	0	a	knee and instill some corticosteroid.
44316	0	a	With kind regards.
44317	0	a	Yours sincerely,

44644	89	a	She quit smoking 40 years ago.
44645	0	a	There is no alcohol use.
44646	0	a	She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer.
44647	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.
44648	26	a	Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6.
44649	0	a	JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.
44650	0	a	Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right.
44651	0	a	Air movement is fair.
44652	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
44653	0	a	Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.
44654	0	a	On heart exam, PMI could not be felt.
44655	0	a	There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.
44656	0	a	There are no rubs or gallops.
44657	0	a	Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
44658	0	a	There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.
44659	0	a	EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG.
44660	0	a	Lab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose.
44661	0	a	Magnesium and calcium were normal.

44669	0	a	IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved.
44670	0	a	The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.
44671	0	a	I think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.
44672	0	a	On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology.
44673	0	a	Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation.
44674	0	a	If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery.
44675	0	a	In addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray.
44676	0	a	Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it.
44677	0	a	Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure.
44678	0	a	Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.

44792	0	a	Dear Margaret,
44793	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in the Cardiology Clinic at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.
44794	1	a	Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.
44795	0	a	She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.
44796	0	a	Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.
44797	0	a	However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.
44798	0	a	She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.

44841	0	a	We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.
44842	0	a	I will see her again in 2 weeks' time.
44843	0	a	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

45191	80	a	62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.
45192	0	a	This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.
45193	0	a	He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.
45194	0	a	There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.
45195	0	a	There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.
45196	0	a	Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.
45197	0	a	No alteration in medications required.

45695	29	a	54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.
45696	0	a	Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
45697	0	a	1.
45698	0	a	GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.
45699	0	a	Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
45700	0	a	Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.
45701	17	a	She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.
45702	0	a	Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.
45703	0	a	We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.
45704	0	a	She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.
45705	0	a	We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
45706	0	a	2.
45707	29	a	HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).
45708	32	a	Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.
45709	0	a	In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
45710	0	a	3.
45711	17	a	DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.
45712	0	a	Will monitor BS.
45713	0	a	4.
45714	0	a	Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

45876	0	a	I talked to him

45878	0	a	I also 
45879	0	a	said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.
45880	0	a	Though 
45881	0	a	slightly anxious he is agreeable to this.
45882	0	a	He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node 
45883	0	a	biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further 
45884	0	a	follow-up or treatment was necessary.
45885	86	a	We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked 
45886	0	a	a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement

46136	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given
46137	67	a	Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was
46138	0	a	also started on CPAP.
46139	0	a	She seemed to be improving clinically for
46140	0	a	some period of time but then began to decline in her mental
46141	0	a	status.
46142	0	a	At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.
46143	0	a	Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient
46144	0	a	likely needed intubation.
46145	0	a	We had hope to hold off to do a
46146	0	a	thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines
46147	0	a	such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the
46148	0	a	procedure.
46149	0	a	On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable
46150	0	a	throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory
46151	0	a	distress.
46152	0	a	Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex
46153	0	a	her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful
46154	0	a	in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in
46155	0	a	between those attempts.
46156	0	a	For full details of the procedure,
46157	0	a	please see the attached procedure note.
46158	0	a	Thoracic Surgery was
46159	0	a	consulted.
46160	0	a	They arrived as the patient was being intubated.
46161	0	a	At
46162	0	a	this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to
46163	0	a	determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural
46164	0	a	effusion and whether it is loculated.
46165	0	a	This study will be
46166	0	a	performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in
46167	0	a	the ICU.
46168	0	a	A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and
46169	0	a	the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.
46170	0	a	******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
46171	0	a	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
46172	0	a	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.
46173	0	a	TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural
46174	0	a	effusion.
46175	0	a	FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.

46297	17	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
46298	0	a	depression.
46299	0	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
46300	0	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
46301	0	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
46302	0	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
46303	0	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
46304	0	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
46305	0	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
46306	0	a	study.
46307	0	a	She is scheduled later this month.
46308	0	a	She has no new complaints, 
46309	72	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
46310	0	a	it over the past two days.
46311	0	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
46312	0	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
46313	0	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
46314	0	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
46315	0	a	the morning.
46316	0	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
46317	0	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
46318	0	a	that she has been taking them.
46319	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
46320	0	a	this is true or not.
46321	0	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
46322	0	a	She says 
46323	0	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
46324	0	a	She was recently started on 
46325	0	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
46326	0	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
46327	0	a	a month.
46328	0	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
46329	0	a	She says overall 
46330	0	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
46331	0	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
46332	0	a	We again discussed the 
46333	0	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
46334	8	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
46335	0	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
46336	0	a	frequency.
46337	0	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
46338	0	a	rest.

46357	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
46358	0	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
46359	0	a	Diabetes.
46360	11	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
46361	0	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
46362	0	a	Finger stick in the 
46363	0	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
46364	0	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
46365	0	a	     over the past couple of months.
46366	0	a	In any event, she most likely need 
46367	0	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
46368	0	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
46369	0	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
46370	72	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
46371	0	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
46372	22	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
46373	0	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
46374	0	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
46375	70	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
46376	0	a	Coronary disease.
46377	8	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
46378	43	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
46379	0	a	as she did have room to go 
46380	0	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
46381	0	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
46382	0	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
46383	0	a	Again, reinforced the 
46384	0	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
46385	0	a	     again as I have in the past.
46386	0	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
46387	0	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
46388	0	a	I told her she should take the 
46389	0	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
46390	0	a	Health maintenance.
46391	0	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
46392	17	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
46393	0	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
46394	0	a	Additionally, I 
46395	0	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
46396	0	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
46397	0	a	I also stressed the

46400	0	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
46401	0	a	She says she is scheduled 
46402	0	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
46403	0	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

46480	0	a	     MR#  401-10-87-8
46481	0	a	Dear Jac:
46482	0	a	I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
46483	0	a	he feels he has actually improved.
46484	0	a	His primary limitation had been
46485	0	a	his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in
46486	0	a	the past.
46487	0	a	We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
46488	0	a	and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study
46489	0	a	two years ago.
46490	0	a	The post volume recordings were normal in each leg.
46491	0	a	Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
46492	0	a	consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.
46493	0	a	No
46494	0	a	systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.
46495	0	a	These were
46496	0	a	unchanged from January, 2072.
46497	0	a	Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
46498	0	a	physically active and is less limited.
46499	44	a	His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,
46500	46	a	Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.
46501	0	a	Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four
46502	0	a	polyps which were removed.
46503	0	a	Apparently, no malignant cells were
46504	0	a	seen in the pathologic specimens.
46505	0	a	On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart
46506	0	a	rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.
46507	0	a	HEENT unremarkable.
46508	0	a	Chest
46509	0	a	was clear.
46510	0	a	Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
46511	0	a	degrees, PMI is normal.
46512	0	a	S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
46513	0	a	split.
46514	0	a	There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
46515	0	a	lower left sternal border.
46516	0	a	Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
46517	0	a	Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
46518	0	a	His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis
46519	0	a	deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent
46520	0	a	with his left anterior hemiblock.
46521	0	a	I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.
46522	0	a	He asked that I see him
46523	0	a	again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy
46524	0	a	to do so.
46525	0	a	If any problems develop in the interim please don't
46526	0	a	hesitate to contact me.
46527	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate
46528	0	a	in his care.

47005	0	a	 Attending Note
47006	0	a	I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.
47007	0	a	I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.
47008	24	a	The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.
47009	0	a	Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.
47010	0	a	CTA was also normal.
47011	0	a	He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past.
47012	70	a	Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.
47013	0	a	His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.
47014	0	a	It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;
47015	0	a	The exam today showed:
47016	0	a	Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
47017	0	a	Left APD
47018	0	a	Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
47019	0	a	Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.
47020	0	a	Was not in UMN fashion.
47021	0	a	Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.
47022	0	a	Assessment:  
47023	0	a	Status post TIA possibly related to AF
47024	0	a	Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
47025	0	a	The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
47026	0	a	Plan:
47027	0	a	Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
47028	0	a	Continue 
47029	70	a	ASA and coumadin and statin

47289	0	a	EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
47290	0	a	  EKG.
47291	0	a	I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
47292	0	a	  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
47293	0	a	  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
47294	7	a	  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
47295	0	a	We reviewed the
47296	0	a	  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
47297	0	a	  angiography and possible angioplasty.
47298	0	a	I made no solid
47299	0	a	  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty
47300	0	a	  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
47301	0	a	  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
47302	0	a	  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and
47303	0	a	  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
47304	0	a	  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
47305	0	a	  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
47306	0	a	  tolerance.
47307	0	a	She and her husband are going to reflect on
47308	0	a	  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the
47309	0	a	  week.
47310	0	a	If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography
47311	0	a	  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately
47312	0	a	  in Cardiology.
47313	0	a	I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see
47314	0	a	  her in the office.
47315	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if
47316	0	a	  I can be of any further assistance.

48018	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 
48019	0	a	normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-
48020	0	a	waves.
48021	0	a	Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
48022	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
48023	0	a	problems as follows:
48024	0	a	Type 2 diabetes.
48025	0	a	Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
48026	11	a	the 9.0.
48027	0	a	She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
48028	0	a	try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
48029	0	a	At this point, it 
48030	57	a	is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
48031	0	a	regimen starting with b.i.d.
48032	57	a	NPH, and we will refer her to the 
48033	0	a	diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 
48034	0	a	with a plan to transition her at that time.
48035	0	a	Her urine 
48036	0	a	microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
48037	0	a	We will recheck 
48038	0	a	her hemoglobin A1c today.
48039	0	a	She has been to the ophthalmologist 
48040	0	a	recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.
48041	0	a	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 
48042	0	a	pain is somewhat concerning.
48043	0	a	She does have coronary disease 
48044	0	a	as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
48045	0	a	She is taking an 
48046	40	a	aspirin and a beta-blocker.
48047	0	a	Her EKG today is normal, and she 
48048	0	a	has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
48049	0	a	exertion.
48050	0	a	Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 
48051	0	a	pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
48052	40	a	the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 
48053	0	a	and beta-blocker.
48054	0	a	I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
48055	0	a	ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
48056	0	a	referring her to Cardiology.

48059	0	a	"	Page 3"
48060	0	a	"	"
48061	28	a	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 
48062	0	a	prefer better blood pressure control.
48063	0	a	She agreed to try the 
48064	30	a	lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 
48065	0	a	thinks it disagrees with her.
48066	0	a	I told her I felt the headache 
48067	30	a	was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
48068	0	a	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 
48069	0	a	I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 
48070	0	a	today without receiving one.
48071	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

48098	0	a	Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE
48099	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.
48100	0	a	Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.
48101	0	a	In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.
48102	0	a	CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.
48103	0	a	Patient was started on UF heparin.
48104	23	a	PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 
48105	70	a	Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin
48106	89	a	Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.

48119	0	a	ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)
48120	0	a	Impression:
48121	0	a	Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
48122	0	a	Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
48123	0	a	Persistent DVT
48124	0	a	PFO with right to left shunt
48125	0	a	COPD
48126	0	a	Recs:
48127	0	a	Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
48128	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
48129	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
48130	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
48131	0	a	Hypercoag w/u
48132	0	a	Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD

48420	0	a	     MR #380-18-32-2
48421	0	a	Dear Dr. Long:
48422	0	a	Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.
48423	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
48424	0	a	2092.
48425	0	a	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
48426	0	a	Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
48427	0	a	failure of unknown etiology.
48428	0	a	She is six years status post
48429	0	a	hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
48430	0	a	leiomyosarcoma was discovered.
48431	0	a	She has an extensive history of
48432	28	a	hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.
48433	0	a	She had one stillborn
48434	0	a	infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions.
48435	0	a	SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
48436	46	a	Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
48437	70	a	furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
48438	0	a	Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
48439	0	a	250 mg qid.
48440	0	a	On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
48441	0	a	distress.
48442	0	a	Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.
48443	0	a	Temperature
48444	0	a	is normal.
48445	0	a	Pulse is 88 beats per minute.
48446	0	a	Blood pressure is
48447	26	a	178/96.
48448	0	a	There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.
48449	0	a	There is a
48450	0	a	buffalo hump.
48451	0	a	The lungs show scattered wheezing.
48452	0	a	Cardiovascular
48453	0	a	exam is normal.
48454	0	a	There are discolorations of the skin across the
48455	0	a	neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
48456	0	a	raised.
48457	85	a	The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.
48458	0	a	ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.
48459	0	a	The
48460	0	a	extremities show trace edema.
48461	0	a	There are several areas of
48462	0	a	superficial petechiae.
48463	0	a	In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
48464	0	a	unclear etiology.
48465	0	a	She does report an episode of lower extremity
48466	0	a	swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.
48467	0	a	ThisRoberta Vincent
48468	0	a	MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
48469	0	a	raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
48470	0	a	in a chronic phase.
48471	0	a	Other diagnostic possibilities include other
48472	0	a	forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
48473	0	a	erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions.
48474	0	a	Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
48475	0	a	time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
48476	0	a	risk due to her body habitus.
48477	0	a	I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
48478	0	a	Vincent.
48479	0	a	Although she has no medical conditions which would
48480	0	a	preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
48481	84	a	obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
48482	0	a	hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.
48483	0	a	I have
48484	0	a	encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
48485	0	a	order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
48486	0	a	transplantation.
48487	0	a	Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
48488	0	a	of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
48489	0	a	been performed previously.
48490	0	a	I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
48491	0	a	kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
48492	0	a	meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
48493	0	a	fistula or placement of a graft.
48494	0	a	Thank you once again for your kind referral.

48914	0	a	Reason for Admission:  Dysphagia
48915	15	a	HPI: Ms. Fay is a 69 year-old woman with diabetes who presented from home with an approximately 2 month history of progressive dysphagia, solid and liquid.
48916	0	a	About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling.
48917	0	a	The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone.
48918	0	a	She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery.
48919	0	a	Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well.
48920	0	a	No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel.
48921	13	a	She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.
48922	0	a	In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
48923	0	a	She was evaluated by the GI department.

48971	0	a	The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia.
48972	0	a	Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out.
48973	0	a	The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable.

49206	0	a	Dear Mr. Louis, 
49207	0	a	It was very nice to see you again the other day.
49208	0	a	I hope you are doing well.
49209	0	a	I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.
49210	0	a	The following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.
49211	0	a	1) Kidney test.
49212	0	a	2) Cholesterol.
49213	0	a	Your cholesterol results are as follows:
49214	0	a	     Total Cholesterol = 129,
49215	0	a	     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,
49216	0	a	     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,
49217	0	a	     triglycerides = 82.
49218	0	a	My records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.
49219	0	a	Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.
49220	0	a	Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.
49221	0	a	3) Hemoglobin A1c.
49222	0	a	This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.
49223	0	a	For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.
49224	0	a	Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.
49225	0	a	It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.
49226	62	a	Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.
49227	0	a	4) X-ray.
49228	0	a	No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
49229	0	a	The following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.
49230	0	a	1) PSA.
49231	0	a	As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.
49232	0	a	This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.
49233	0	a	My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.
49234	0	a	I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.
49235	0	a	At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.
49236	0	a	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.
49237	0	a	I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.

50022	0	a	He underwent angioplasty of the
50023	1	a	circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD.
50024	0	a	The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stent
50025	0	a	versus a plain stent.
50026	0	a	This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.
50027	0	a	Since then he has been
50028	0	a	tired, otherwise felt well.
50029	0	a	He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.

50031	0	a	have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.

50033	0	a	regular exercise program.

50047	0	a	Coronary:  S3.
50048	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Doing well.
50049	0	a	I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on low

50375	7	a	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest discomfort.
50376	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 
50377	0	a	who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the 
50378	0	a	night, last night, and into today.
50379	66	a	He finally took nitroglycerin 
50380	0	a	tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest 
50381	0	a	discomfort.
50382	0	a	The patient has known history of coronary artery 
50383	4	a	disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, 
50384	0	a	however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more 
50385	0	a	tire than usual.
50386	0	a	He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 
50387	0	a	rested throughout the rest of the day.
50388	0	a	Then last night, he had 
50389	0	a	some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of.
50390	0	a	Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 
50391	0	a	morning hours.
50392	0	a	He felt he was wheezing.
50393	0	a	This resolved after he 
50394	0	a	got up and walked around.
50395	66	a	He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 
50396	0	a	morning.
50397	66	a	These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 
50398	0	a	obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.
50399	0	a	He then came in 
50400	0	a	to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the 
50401	0	a	emergency department for evaluation.
50402	0	a	Please see the handwritten 
50403	0	a	emergency department record for additional details.
50404	4	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease 
50405	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency 
50406	0	a	department record.
50407	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not 
50408	0	a	tachypneic.
50409	26	a	His blood pressure is 160/80.
50410	0	a	His heart rate is in 
50411	0	a	the 50s.
50412	0	a	There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on 
50413	0	a	examination.
50414	0	a	There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs 
50415	0	a	are clear to auscultation.
50416	0	a	His heart examination is distant, with 
50417	0	a	no murmurs or gallops appreciated.
50418	0	a	His extremities have trace 
50419	0	a	edema.
50420	0	a	Abdomen in soft and non-tender.
50421	0	a	Pulses are equal.
50422	0	a	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle 
50423	0	a	branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous 
50424	0	a	tracings.
50425	0	a	His other laboratory studies are pending.
50426	0	a	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his 
50427	0	a	physician, Dr. Echeverria.
50428	0	a	We both agree that the patient has 
50429	0	a	probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible 
50430	0	a	unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and 
50431	0	a	paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
50432	0	a	It is possible that he has silent 
50433	0	a	ischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch 
50434	0	a	pattern.
50435	0	a	Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being 
50436	0	a	sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for 
50437	0	a	further medical management.
50438	0	a	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery 
50439	4	a	disease.
50440	0	a	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
50441	0	a	admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

50855	0	a	Patient Name: YOUNT, PATRICIA;  MRN: 4711083
50856	0	a	Dictated on: 10/24/2088 by YOEL NEWCOMB, M.D.
50857	0	a	Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.
50858	0	a	She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.
50859	0	a	Brought her in to have an evaluation.
50860	0	a	X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.
50861	15	a	Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.
50862	0	a	No prior surgeries.
50863	0	a	No medications.
50864	0	a	No known drug allergies.
50865	0	a	Lists no family history of any problems.
50866	0	a	Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.
50867	0	a	On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.
50868	0	a	No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.
50869	0	a	Negative scaphoid shift test.
50870	0	a	Slight tenderness over the distal radius.
50871	0	a	Normal tendon function.
50872	0	a	My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

50917	0	a	1.
50918	11	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
50919	0	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
50920	0	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
50921	0	a	2.
50922	0	a	BPH.
50923	0	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
50924	0	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
50925	0	a	3.
50926	0	a	Hypertension.
50927	0	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
50928	0	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
50929	0	a	4.
50930	0	a	COPD.
50931	0	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
50932	0	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
50933	0	a	5.
50934	0	a	Elevated cholesterol.
50935	0	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
50936	0	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
50937	0	a	6.
50938	0	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
50939	0	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
50940	15	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
50941	0	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

51090	0	a	Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.
51091	0	a	She has been in Rhode Island for 
51092	0	a	six months.
51093	0	a	Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.
51094	0	a	She 
51095	0	a	does not have any palpitations.
51096	0	a	She does not note that this is 
51097	0	a	associated with exertion.
51098	0	a	She does have diaphoresis associated with it.
51099	0	a	She does not have any shortness of breath.
51100	0	a	This heaviness has been in 
51101	0	a	her chest on and off for the last six weeks.
51102	0	a	She is quite concerned.
51103	28	a	She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.
51104	0	a	She also has 
51105	23	a	hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.
51106	0	a	Her health 
51107	0	a	maintenance has been in order.
51108	0	a	She has just had a hysterectomy.
51109	0	a	needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.
51110	0	a	However, today I am most 
51111	0	a	concerned about her chest heaviness.
51112	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
51113	0	a	20 and pulse is 68.
51114	0	a	Neck is supple.
51115	0	a	There is no lymphadenopathy.
51116	0	a	Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.

51131	0	a	We also sent her for an exercise 
51132	0	a	tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
51133	0	a	maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
51134	0	a	seconds.
51135	0	a	She had no evidence of ischemia.
51136	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

51176	0	a	CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks
51177	0	a	HPI:  
51178	0	a	Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.
51179	0	a	Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.
51180	0	a	He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.
51181	0	a	This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.
51182	0	a	He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits.
51183	0	a	He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.
51184	0	a	No new incontinence.
51185	0	a	This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.
51186	0	a	ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative.
51187	0	a	CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.
51188	0	a	Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
51189	0	a	LP was negative.

51267	0	a	ASSESSMENT & PLAN
51268	0	a	87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.
51269	0	a	The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
51270	0	a	Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.
51271	0	a	Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.
51272	0	a	However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.
51273	0	a	Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.
51274	0	a	As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely.
51275	0	a	LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
51276	0	a	One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.
51277	0	a	A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
51278	0	a	Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly.
51279	0	a	However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.
51280	0	a	Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative.
51281	0	a	CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
51282	0	a	Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
51283	0	a	will d/w attending
51284	0	a	consider psychiatric consult
51285	0	a	Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
51286	0	a	Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH
51287	0	a	H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.
51288	17	a	NIDDM: Will start RISS
51289	70	a	Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD
51290	29	a	HTN: metoprolol
51291	0	a	Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

52907	0	a	Dear Dr. Pagan:
52908	0	a	Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a follow-up visit.
52909	0	a	As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.
52910	0	a	Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.
52911	0	a	In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.
52912	0	a	A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.
52913	0	a	She is not particularly active.
52914	0	a	She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.
52915	0	a	Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.
52916	40	a	She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.
52917	88	a	She is a nonsmoker.
52918	0	a	On examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits.
52919	0	a	Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.
52920	0	a	Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.
52921	0	a	On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused.
52922	0	a	On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.
52923	0	a	The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.
52924	0	a	There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.
52925	0	a	There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.
52926	0	a	This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.
52927	0	a	A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.
52928	0	a	The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.
52929	0	a	As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.
52930	0	a	Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.
52931	0	a	At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.
52932	0	a	The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.
52933	0	a	Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.
52934	0	a	I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.
52935	0	a	At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.
52936	40	a	I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.
52937	0	a	I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration.
52938	0	a	At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.
52939	0	a	If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.
52940	0	a	Thank you again for allowing us to participate in her care.
52941	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.
52942	0	a	Sincerely,

53096	0	a	Dear Dr. Easterling: 
53097	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078.
53098	0	a	He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis.
53099	0	a	He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning.
53100	0	a	His episodes of chest pain are interesting.
53101	0	a	He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching.
53102	0	a	The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset.
53103	0	a	They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge.
53104	0	a	He is otherwise in fairly good health.
53105	0	a	Past medical history:
53106	0	a	   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
53107	0	a	2) Palpitations 
53108	0	a	3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

53115	0	a	   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack.
53116	0	a	He has four siblings, all in good health.
53117	0	a	Social history:
53118	0	a	   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health.
53119	0	a	He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.
53120	0	a	Habits: He has never used street drugs.
53121	88	a	He does not smoke tobacco.
53122	0	a	He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.
53123	0	a	Review of systems:
53124	0	a	   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

53144	0	a	   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia.
53145	0	a	Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.
53146	0	a	Assessment and plan:
53147	0	a	   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort.
53148	0	a	Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se.
53149	0	a	It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past.
53150	0	a	We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed.
53151	0	a	I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress.

53310	0	a	Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.
53311	0	a	TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.
53312	0	a	NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.
53313	0	a	INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.
53314	0	a	He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.
53315	0	a	He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.
53316	0	a	He has no weakness in any extremities.
53317	0	a	His nocturia has decreased from three to one.
53318	0	a	"His hands feel a little ""fuzzy."""

53877	0	a	Dear Dr.  Morgan:
53878	5	a	  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.
53879	89	a	She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago.
53880	28	a	She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD.
53881	0	a	She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine.
53882	0	a	She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler.
53883	0	a	With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.
53884	0	a	She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time.
53885	0	a	These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week.
53886	0	a	She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.
53887	0	a	To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus.
53888	0	a	This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery.
53889	0	a	There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery.
53890	0	a	She was then referred to me for further evaluation.
53891	0	a	Past medical history:
53892	0	a	   Hypertension.

53946	0	a	    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.
53947	0	a	Assessment and plan:
53948	28	a	   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past.
53949	0	a	She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy.
53950	0	a	Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm.
53951	0	a	I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan.
53952	0	a	She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.
53953	0	a	Plan: 
53954	0	a	1.
53955	0	a	Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment.
53956	0	a	2.
53957	0	a	Treatment of her emphysema as per your office.
53958	0	a	3.
53959	0	a	I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.

54758	0	a	s/p XRT to esophagus
54759	0	a	Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 
54760	0	a	History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
54761	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
54762	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
54763	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
54764	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
54765	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
54766	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
54767	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
54768	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
54769	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
54770	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
54771	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
54772	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
54773	0	a	He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.
54774	0	a	He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
54775	0	a	He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.
54776	0	a	No bleeding.
54777	0	a	He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest.
54778	0	a	He is fatigued.

55213	0	a	HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.
55214	0	a	He is status post TURP by Dr. 
55215	0	a	Nixon.
55216	0	a	He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
55217	0	a	thinks that this should get better.
55218	0	a	We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
55219	0	a	range.
55220	0	a	We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
55221	0	a	that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
55222	0	a	dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
55223	0	a	He has remained on digoxin status 
55224	1	a	post his myocardial infarction.
55225	0	a	We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
55226	0	a	We also have been concerned 
55227	0	a	that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
55228	0	a	about his wife's situation with breast cancer.
55229	0	a	We had a long discussion 
55230	0	a	about this.
55231	0	a	Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.
55232	26	a	His blood pressure was 178/80.
55233	0	a	The follow-up was 170/80.
55234	0	a	His neck was 
55235	0	a	supple.
55236	0	a	Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.
55237	0	a	Cardiac 
55238	0	a	exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
55239	0	a	Abdomen 
55240	0	a	was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
55241	0	a	Extremities were 
55242	0	a	clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
55243	0	a	Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
55244	0	a	negative.
55245	0	a	Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.
55246	0	a	Platelets were within normal 
55247	0	a	limits.
55248	0	a	White count is 8.3.
55249	0	a	Digoxin is 0.9.
55250	0	a	Lytes are within normal 
55251	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
55252	0	a	1.
55253	0	a	Status post TURP.
55254	0	a	He appears to be recovering well.
55255	0	a	He has had 
55256	0	a	     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
55257	0	a	2.
55258	0	a	Thrombocytopenia.
55259	0	a	This was very relative.
55260	0	a	It now appears to have 
55261	0	a	     resolved.
55262	0	a	3.
55263	4	a	Coronary artery disease.
55264	0	a	As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
55265	0	a	     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.
55266	0	a	At 
55267	40	a	     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
55268	0	a	     Lasix.
55269	0	a	However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
55270	0	a	     treatment with anti-anginals.
55271	0	a	4.
55272	22	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
55273	0	a	This has been well-controlled recently.
55274	0	a	His 
55275	0	a	     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
55276	0	a	5.
55277	0	a	Depression.
55278	0	a	He continues on Ambien.
55279	0	a	He has some discretion about 
55280	0	a	     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
55281	0	a	     uncertainty resolved.

55316	0	a	HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.
55317	0	a	The patient 
55318	28	a	is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
55319	3	a	coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
55320	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.
55321	0	a	The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.
55322	0	a	With regard to the 
55323	0	a	latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
55324	0	a	initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
55325	0	a	notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
55326	0	a	uncomfortable with this.
55327	0	a	He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
55328	0	a	pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
55329	0	a	of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.
55330	0	a	The patient knows the foods that give 
55331	0	a	him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
55332	0	a	avoid them as much as possible.
55333	0	a	The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
55334	0	a	which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
55335	0	a	would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
55336	0	a	blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
55337	0	a	we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).
55338	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
55339	0	a	the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
55340	0	a	of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.
55341	0	a	The patient does remain on 
55342	28	a	Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
55343	26	a	pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
55344	0	a	minutes later was 130/74.
55345	0	a	The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.

55348	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.
55349	0	a	Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me 
55350	0	a	was 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, 
55351	0	a	respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.

55356	30	a	The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as 
55357	0	a	     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.
55358	0	a	His blood pressure 
55359	0	a	     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
55360	0	a	One of the issues 
55361	0	a	     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.
55362	0	a	"The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and "
55363	1	a	     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
55364	0	a	     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
55365	0	a	     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
55366	30	a	     Zestril with a beta-blocker.

55378	0	a	The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which

55383	0	a	The patient notes that there is less 
55384	0	a	     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.
55385	0	a	The patient does take Lasix 
55386	0	a	     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any 
55387	0	a	     difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.

55393	0	a	The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
55394	0	a	     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG

55396	0	a	     would like to stay on this.
55397	0	a	Patient has enough to last until I see 
55398	0	a	     him next time.
55399	0	a	I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
55400	0	a	patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.
55401	0	a	The cholesterol 
55402	0	a	is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the

55521	17	a	Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.
55522	57	a	Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.
55523	59	a	Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.
55524	0	a	Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.
55525	59	a	Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.
55526	59	a	Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.
55527	0	a	Recommend:
55528	59	a	Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
55529	59	a	Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
55530	59	a	Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
55531	0	a	Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g.
55532	31	a	Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
55533	0	a	Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

56071	0	a	I believe the pedal edema may be related to the

56075	0	a	it may take a few days to resolve.

56086	0	a	to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
56087	0	a	for a repeat blood pressure check.
56088	0	a	The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
56089	15	a	appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
56090	0	a	see if there is anything more we can do to change her
56091	57	a	insulin regimen.
56092	0	a	The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
56093	0	a	otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and

56216	0	a	Imp/Plan:
56217	0	a	Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature.
56218	0	a	The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.
56219	0	a	He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow.
56220	0	a	They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process.
56221	0	a	He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM.
56222	0	a	We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out.
56223	0	a	Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.
56224	0	a	In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically.
56225	0	a	Is any of this TB?
56226	0	a	Recommend:
56227	0	a	-- skeletal survey
56228	0	a	-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas
56229	0	a	-- beta-2 microglobulin
56230	0	a	-- reticulocyte count
56231	0	a	-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco
56232	0	a	-- guaiac all stools
56233	0	a	-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential
56234	0	a	-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today.
56235	0	a	-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.
56236	0	a	Thank you for this consult.

56624	0	a	While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke.
56625	0	a	These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli.
56626	0	a	Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

56688	0	a	CURRENT ISSUES:
56689	0	a	1.
56690	15	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
56691	0	a	The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
56692	11	a	     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.
56693	0	a	We discussed 
56694	0	a	     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
56695	58	a	     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
56696	0	a	     tighter control.
56697	0	a	He states he has been following his finger 
56698	0	a	     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this.
56699	0	a	His 
56700	57	a	     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
56701	0	a	     regular.
56702	57	a	At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
56703	0	a	     regular at dinnertime.
56704	0	a	He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
56705	0	a	2.
56706	22	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
56707	0	a	Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
56708	69	a	     rash to his simvastatin.
56709	0	a	This resolved on the discontinuation of 
56710	69	a	     the simvastatin.
56711	19	a	Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
56712	0	a	     January, 2067.
56713	0	a	He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
56714	0	a	     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
56715	0	a	     fats.
56716	0	a	3.
56717	0	a	Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
56718	0	a	The 
56719	0	a	     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
56720	0	a	     Jobst stocking.
56721	0	a	He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
56722	0	a	     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
56723	0	a	     compliant with the stocking.
56724	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.
56725	0	a	Heart rate:  76.
56726	0	a	Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.
56727	0	a	Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
56728	0	a	rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
56729	0	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
56730	84	a	Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.
56731	0	a	Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.
56732	0	a	There is 1+ pedal edema of 
56733	0	a	the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.
56734	0	a	Foot 
56735	0	a	care remains excellent.
56736	0	a	IMPRESSION:                         
56737	0	a	We will increase the patient's 
56738	57	a	     morning NPH dose to 40 units.
56739	0	a	He will once again try to become 
56740	0	a	     more compliant with his diet.
56741	0	a	He will be scheduled for a follow up 
56742	0	a	     ophthalmologic examination.
56743	0	a	We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
56744	69	a	     his recent rash to simvastin.

56775	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
56776	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in
56777	0	a	transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively
56778	0	a	worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated
56779	0	a	with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday.
56780	0	a	He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,
56781	0	a	progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal
56782	0	a	exertion.
56783	0	a	He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which
56784	0	a	did radiate to his left shoulder.
56785	0	a	This seemed to resolve
56786	0	a	spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind
56787	0	a	of exertion at all.
56788	0	a	The shortness of breath was exclusively
56789	0	a	exertional.
56790	0	a	He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
56791	0	a	presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.
56792	0	a	No fevers.
56793	0	a	He does have a
56794	0	a	slight cough that is nonproductive.
56795	0	a	He was seen at a local
56796	0	a	Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as
56797	67	a	well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states
56798	0	a	he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.
56799	0	a	He was
56800	0	a	cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his
56801	0	a	cardiologist at SAH.
56802	0	a	Additionally, at the outside Emergency
56803	0	a	Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,
56804	0	a	but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.
56805	28	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally
56806	15	a	controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter.
56807	0	a	He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.
56808	89	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of
56809	0	a	smoking.
56810	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,
56811	0	a	otherwise negative.
56812	44	a	MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,
56813	69	a	glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.
56814	0	a	ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.
56815	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate
56816	26	a	20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
56817	0	a	HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
56818	0	a	Pleasant, calm.
56819	0	a	Neck is
56820	0	a	supple.
56821	0	a	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for
56822	0	a	scattered rales in the left lower lung field.
56823	0	a	Cardiovascular: 
56824	0	a	Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
56825	0	a	Abdomen is soft and
56826	0	a	nontender.
56827	0	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
56828	0	a	Extremities:  He has
56829	0	a	got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is
56830	0	a	symmetric.
56831	0	a	Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities
56832	0	a	equally.
56833	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave
56834	0	a	progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.
56835	0	a	Chest x-ray
56836	0	a	shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural
56837	0	a	effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild
56838	0	a	pulmonary edema.
56839	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with
56840	0	a	creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.
56841	0	a	BNP is still pending.
56842	0	a	INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on
56843	0	a	Coumadin.
56844	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency
56845	0	a	Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2
56846	0	a	liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic
56847	0	a	improvement in his dyspnea.
56848	0	a	He has no further episodes of chest
56849	0	a	pain or pressure.
56850	0	a	I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,
56851	0	a	the SAH cardiologist on-call.
56852	0	a	I believe this patient has CHF
56853	0	a	exacerbation.
56854	0	a	He also was recently cardioverted, which ____
56855	0	a	explain his troponin elevation.
56856	0	a	Additionally, his CHF
56857	0	a	exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I
56858	0	a	doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
56859	0	a	At this point,
56860	0	a	the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on

56951	0	a	Dear Dr. Keller,
56952	0	a	Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
56953	0	a	Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
56954	0	a	We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
56955	23	a	"HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband."
56956	0	a	This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.
56957	0	a	She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
56958	0	a	In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
56959	0	a	The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.
56960	0	a	In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.
56961	0	a	She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.
56962	0	a	She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.
56963	0	a	She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.
56964	0	a	The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.
56965	0	a	She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.
56966	11	a	Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.
56967	0	a	CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
56968	40	a	She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.
56969	0	a	Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.
56970	0	a	She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.
56971	0	a	ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
56972	0	a	Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).
56973	0	a	She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.
56974	0	a	Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.
56975	0	a	In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.
56976	0	a	Past Medical History: 
56977	1	a	CAD s/p LAD stent 2144

57048	23	a	Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.
57049	0	a	Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.
57050	0	a	At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.
57051	0	a	Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.
57052	0	a	We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.
57053	0	a	She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.
57054	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
57055	0	a	We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

58512	0	a	Name:  Xochilt Vuong
58513	0	a	MRN:  6398353
58514	0	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.
58515	17	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 
58516	0	a	going back more than 10 years.
58517	28	a	She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 
58518	0	a	over approximately the same period of time.
58519	0	a	She has a complicated history 
58520	0	a	including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.
58521	0	a	Her 
58522	0	a	creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 
58523	0	a	1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 
58524	0	a	obtained on July 06, 2064.
58525	0	a	She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.
58526	0	a	Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 
58527	0	a	at 81.
58528	0	a	Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 
58529	0	a	proteinuria since that time.
58530	0	a	Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 
58531	0	a	March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 
58532	0	a	obstruction, stones, or masses.
58533	0	a	She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
58534	0	a	She does 
58535	17	a	not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 
58536	0	a	for any proliferative retinopathy.
58537	0	a	Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 
58538	0	a	almost constant nausea.
58539	0	a	She vomits rarely.
58540	0	a	Her weight has fallen by about 20 
58541	0	a	pounds.
58542	0	a	She is slightly constipated.
58543	0	a	She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.

58569	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 
58570	0	a	reasonably comfortable.
58571	0	a	She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 
58572	0	a	which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
58573	0	a	Her blood pressure in 
58574	26	a	the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.
58575	0	a	Her chest has a few basal 
58576	0	a	crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
58577	0	a	JVP fills below the 
58578	0	a	sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 
58579	0	a	sternal border.
58580	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
58581	0	a	There is no renal tenderness.
58582	0	a	Extremities have no edema.
58583	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
58584	28	a	10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
58585	0	a	The 
58586	0	a	proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 
58587	0	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
58588	0	a	It would be useful to know 
58589	0	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
58590	0	a	It is, of course, also 
58591	0	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
58592	0	a	Their symmetry and 
58593	0	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
58594	0	a	The ACE 
58595	0	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
58596	0	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
58597	0	a	Her loss of appetite and 
58598	0	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
58599	0	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
58600	17	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
58601	0	a	hyperlipidemia.
58602	0	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
58603	0	a	It think it 
58604	31	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
58605	0	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
58606	0	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
58607	0	a	If, of course, shortness of 
58608	0	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
58609	0	a	reasonable.
58610	0	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
58611	0	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
58612	0	a	requirement for Lasix.
58613	0	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
58614	0	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
58615	0	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
58616	0	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
58617	0	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
58618	0	a	Aranesp).
58619	0	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
58620	0	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
58621	0	a	If so, the 
58622	0	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
58623	0	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
58624	0	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
58625	0	a	It would 
58626	0	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
58627	0	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
58628	0	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
58629	0	a	a need for it arises.
58630	0	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
58631	0	a	done in the next few months.
58632	0	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
58633	0	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
58634	0	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
58635	0	a	these measures as necessary.
58636	0	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
58637	0	a	Wanda
58638	0	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
58639	0	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
58640	0	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
58641	0	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

58846	90	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
58847	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
58848	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
58849	29	a	Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
58850	0	a	She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.
58851	0	a	This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.
58852	49	a	Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
58853	0	a	Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.
58854	0	a	Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
58855	49	a	She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.
58856	0	a	She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.
58857	1	a	Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.
58858	0	a	She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.
58859	0	a	Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.
58860	79	a	Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
58861	0	a	Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
58862	0	a	However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.
58863	0	a	She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.
58864	0	a	She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.
58865	0	a	She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.
58866	0	a	She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.
58867	0	a	She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
58868	0	a	"She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

58938	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
58939	29	a	58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
58940	0	a	She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.
58941	79	a	We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
58942	0	a	The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.
58943	0	a	If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.
58944	17	a	However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.
58945	78	a	Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.
58946	70	a	Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
58947	0	a	Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.
58948	0	a	I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.
58949	0	a	She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
58950	0	a	If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.
58951	0	a	Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.
58952	0	a	Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.
58953	0	a	Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
58954	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
58955	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
58956	0	a	I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.

59102	15	a	HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
59103	0	a	This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time.

59107	0	a	She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD.
59108	0	a	She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.

59312	0	a	Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,
59313	28	a	  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse.
59314	0	a	She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure.
59315	0	a	About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable.
59316	0	a	She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols.
59317	0	a	She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson.
59318	0	a	She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home.
59319	0	a	She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top.
59320	0	a	She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness.
59321	0	a	She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema.
59322	0	a	She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope.

60096	0	a	Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.
60097	0	a	Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.
60098	0	a	I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.

61050	0	a	"chest."""
61051	0	a	She has also had abdominal pain and has felt quite
61052	0	a	poorly.
61053	0	a	She did call this service this past weekend she
61054	0	a	states and never received a call back.
61055	0	a	She called me this
61056	0	a	morning, and I saw her immediately.
61057	0	a	The pain has not gone
61058	0	a	down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.
61059	0	a	She
61060	0	a	feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
61061	0	a	says that her blood sugars have been quite high.
61062	0	a	She does
61063	15	a	have diabetes.
61064	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.
61065	0	a	Her
61066	0	a	blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a

61074	0	a	are not felt.
61075	0	a	EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
61076	0	a	myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
61077	0	a	last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
61078	0	a	precordium.
61079	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction.
61080	0	a	Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
61081	0	a	think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
61082	0	a	ward and attend her there.

62223	0	a	RE: LINDSAY, Anastasha 
62224	0	a	SDP#: 5563788 
62225	0	a	Dear Dr. Ho:  
62226	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lindsay today in follow up at the Saint Davids Pavilion Neurology.
62227	0	a	I last saw her on 07/27/2112.
62228	0	a	She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness.
62229	0	a	Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well.
62230	0	a	She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady.
62231	0	a	She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness.
62232	0	a	She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls.
62233	0	a	Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her.
62234	43	a	She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
62235	0	a	instead of 25 mg p.o.
62236	0	a	q.d.
62237	0	a	She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes.
62238	0	a	She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia.
62239	0	a	She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.
62240	0	a	"She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that ""her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane""."
62241	80	a	She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o.
62242	0	a	from aspirin.
62243	0	a	This was done without my knowledge as well.
62244	0	a	"She continues to have difficulty ""feeling my feet"" and this has been a chronic problem for her as well."
62245	0	a	On examination she is alert.
62246	0	a	She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed.
62247	0	a	Her speech is fluent in English.
62248	0	a	English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language.
62249	0	a	Her visual fields are full to confrontation.
62250	0	a	Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus.
62251	0	a	Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening.
62252	0	a	She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side.
62253	0	a	She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing.
62254	0	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady.
62255	0	a	She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.
62256	0	a	IMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion.
62257	0	a	This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time.
62258	0	a	In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor.
62259	43	a	Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether.
62260	0	a	Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.
62261	0	a	I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.
62262	0	a	Sincerely,

62479	0	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
62480	0	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
62481	0	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
62482	0	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
62483	0	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
62484	0	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
62485	0	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
62486	0	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
62487	0	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

62682	0	a	Post, IN  86454
62683	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
62684	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
62685	1	a	As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.
62686	1	a	He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.
62687	40	a	Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.
62688	0	a	Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.
62689	7	a	He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.
62690	1	a	He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.
62691	78	a	Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.
62692	0	a	He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.
62693	0	a	Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
62694	0	a	As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.
62695	0	a	He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.
62696	43	a	He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
62697	78	a	Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).
62698	0	a	Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
62699	0	a	He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
62700	40	a	His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o.
62701	78	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
62702	68	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
62703	32	a	daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o.
62704	43	a	daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o.
62705	0	a	daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
62706	0	a	daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily.
62707	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
62708	0	a	Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.
62709	0	a	He is in no distress.
62710	0	a	Weight is 221 lbs.
62711	26	a	Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.
62712	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.
62713	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
62714	0	a	His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
62715	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
62716	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
62717	0	a	He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.
62718	0	a	EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.
62719	0	a	We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
62720	64	a	He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
62721	0	a	His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL.
62722	0	a	His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.
62723	12	a	HbA1c is 7.2%.
62724	0	a	The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.
62725	0	a	Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
62726	0	a	To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:
62727	0	a	1.
62728	68	a	Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.
62729	0	a	2.
62730	0	a	Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.
62731	78	a	Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
62732	0	a	3.
62733	0	a	He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.
62734	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.
62735	0	a	As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.
62736	0	a	The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.
62737	0	a	Yours sincerely,
62738	0	a	______________________________

62746	0	a	RE:  Kenneth Umstead
62747	0	a	     MR #401-10-87-8
62748	0	a	Dear Jac:
62749	0	a	I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today
62750	0	a	and he seems like he is improved.
62751	0	a	He feels his legs are better and
62752	0	a	that he can walk greater distances.
62753	0	a	He feels very comfortable.
62754	44	a	His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
62755	46	a	Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day.
62756	26	a	On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
62757	0	a	65 and regular.
62758	0	a	Weight 210 pounds.
62759	0	a	Head and neck unremarkable.
62760	0	a	Chest is clear.
62761	0	a	Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
62762	0	a	systolic ejection murmur.
62763	0	a	The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
62764	0	a	Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
62765	0	a	sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation.
62766	0	a	There is a nonspecific
62767	0	a	intraventricular conduction delay.
62768	0	a	I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well.
62769	0	a	He would like to have his
62770	0	a	arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
62771	0	a	schedule.
62772	44	a	In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
62773	0	a	if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
62774	0	a	more prolonged risk prevention.
62775	0	a	I suggest that we increase it to 50
62776	0	a	mg bid.
62777	0	a	I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
62778	0	a	eye on it.
62779	0	a	If it drops too low we can reduce the dose.
62780	0	a	He asked
62781	0	a	that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
62782	0	a	and I will be happy to do so.
62783	0	a	If any problems develop in the
62784	0	a	interim please do not hesitate to contact me.
62785	0	a	Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
62786	0	a	Kindest regards.

62800	0	a	New Patient Visit
62801	0	a	Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion
62802	0	a	History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden.
62803	0	a	He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH.
62804	0	a	Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT.
62805	0	a	Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53.
62806	0	a	He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments.
62807	0	a	The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative.
62808	0	a	He has the reports here with him.
62809	0	a	The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion.
62810	0	a	He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis.
62811	0	a	This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him.
62812	0	a	He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.
62813	0	a	Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH.
62814	0	a	I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future.
62815	0	a	I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA.
62816	0	a	He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

63643	0	a	I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.
63644	0	a	Recommendations:
63645	0	a	-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also

63662	0	a	RE: Otis Narvaez
63663	0	a	        MR   #04561326
63664	0	a	Dear Dr. Huynh:
63665	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 
63666	0	a	consultation.
63667	0	a	As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 
63668	15	a	of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
63669	0	a	Recently, he underwent 
63670	0	a	evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 
63671	0	a	dobutamine stress echocardiography.
63672	0	a	The echocardiogram revealed reduced 
63673	0	a	left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.
63674	0	a	There was no evidence of ischemia.
63675	0	a	He subsequently underwent coronary 
63676	0	a	catheterization.
63677	0	a	I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 
63678	0	a	told that he had no arterial blockages.
63679	0	a	Symptomatically, he is 
63680	0	a	significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.
63681	0	a	He has attributed 
63682	0	a	this to his weight.
63683	32	a	He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 
63684	0	a	although he has not been taking either of these medications.
63685	0	a	Prior to 
63686	0	a	his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 
63687	0	a	upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.
63688	0	a	This was confirmed 
63689	0	a	subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 
63690	0	a	lung malignancy.
63691	0	a	He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 
63692	0	a	you.
63693	28	a	His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 
63694	84	a	back pain, and obesity.
63695	60	a	Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 
63696	0	a	q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.
63697	0	a	No drug allergies
63698	0	a	Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.
63699	0	a	Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.
63700	0	a	He smoked for 
63701	89	a	40 years but quit approximately three years ago.
63702	0	a	He drinks rarely,

63706	0	a	Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.
63707	0	a	He denies 
63708	0	a	gastrointestinal complaints.
63709	85	a	On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 
63710	0	a	140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.
63711	0	a	HEENT is unremarkable, neck 
63712	0	a	supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 
63713	0	a	without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 
63714	0	a	regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 
63715	0	a	murmurs or rubs.
63716	0	a	Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 
63717	0	a	CVA tenderness.
63718	0	a	No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
63719	0	a	Pulses full.
63720	0	a	Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 
63721	0	a	function by echocardiogram.
63722	0	a	By report he has no evidence of coronary 
63723	0	a	artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.
63724	0	a	If indeed 
63725	0	a	it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 
63726	0	a	this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 
63727	15	a	his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.
63728	0	a	In any case, this 
63729	0	a	puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 
63730	0	a	than if he had significant coronary disease.
63731	0	a	I see no reason why you 
63732	0	a	should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.
63733	0	a	Prior 
63734	32	a	to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.
63735	0	a	I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 
63736	0	a	to South Side Hospital.

63862	0	a	Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression.
63863	0	a	Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
63864	0	a	A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 
63865	0	a	""" Hematoma around right subclavian artery."

63869	0	a	On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall.
63870	0	a	His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses.
63871	0	a	There are no thrills or bruits.
63872	0	a	My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:
63873	0	a	1).
63874	0	a	Hematoma- to be expected
63875	0	a	2).
63876	0	a	Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.
63877	0	a	3).
63878	0	a	Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.
63879	0	a	4).
63880	0	a	Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
63881	0	a	Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order.
63882	0	a	This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
63883	0	a	If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it.
63884	0	a	He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
63885	0	a	There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

64215	0	a	Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811
64216	0	a	Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098
64217	0	a	ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
64218	0	a	Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
64219	0	a	History of Present Illness:
64220	0	a	"	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery."
64221	0	a	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.
64222	0	a	If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution.
64223	0	a	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
64224	0	a	Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.
64225	31	a	His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.
64226	0	a	A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.
64227	0	a	There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.
64228	0	a	The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).
64229	0	a	An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
64230	0	a	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
64231	0	a	He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.
64232	0	a	He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.
64233	0	a	He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
64234	0	a	He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.
64235	0	a	His lasix dose has not changed.
64236	4	a	He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
64237	0	a	He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.
64238	0	a	A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

64324	0	a	Impression and Plan:
64325	0	a	This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
64326	0	a	The issues include:
64327	0	a	Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
64328	0	a	I would consider:
64329	0	a	increasing his diuretic (eg.
64330	0	a	Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
64331	0	a	Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.
64332	0	a	He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
64333	0	a	consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
64334	0	a	consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
64335	1	a	Prevention of periperative MI
64336	43	a	He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
64337	4	a	No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
64338	0	a	Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
64339	0	a	Prevention of perioperative AF
64340	43	a	Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
64341	0	a	Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
64342	0	a	Endocarditis prophylaxis
64343	0	a	He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
64344	0	a	We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.
