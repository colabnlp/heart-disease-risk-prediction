1	Mr. Villegas is seen today.
2	I have not seen him since November.
3	About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
4	he was gaining weight.
5	He does feel that his shoulders are
6	definitely improved.
7	It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
8	I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
9	medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
10	and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.
11	He is concerned because of the
12	relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
13	right.
14	When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
15	is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.
16	This
17	only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.
18	He has
19	no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
20	cranial complaints.
21	On examination today, BP 120/80.
22	He has no bruits over the
23	carotid.
24	He has no tenderness in this region either.
25	He has good
26	peripheral pulses at the arms.
27	His joint examination is much
28	improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
29	synovitis.
30	Clinical Impression:
31	#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
32	Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.
33	He has stopped the
34	Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.
35	#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
36	disease.
37	Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.
38	Patient
39	advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.
40	been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
41	that he continue to do so.
42	He will follow-up with me shortly after
43	the ultrasound study.

173	Reason for Visit
174	Sternal pain.
175	History of Present Illness
176	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
177	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
178	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
179	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
180	No variation with food.
181	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
182	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
183	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
184	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).
185	ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail.
186	He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

228	No focal rhonchi.
229	No pleural rub.
230	+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth.
231	No sternal movement wiht palpation.
232	No palpable sternal wire.

239	Extremity
240	Warm.
241	No edema.
242	Lab Test
243	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
244	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
245	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
246	Impression
247	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
248	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
249	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
250	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
251	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
252	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
253	Plan
254	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
255	- check CXR
256	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
257	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
258	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
259	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

308	This is a preliminary dictation.
309	PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
310	patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 
311	diabetes who presents with fever and chills.
312	He is four weeks 
313	status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 
314	infected and had to be revised.
315	He has been doing well, but now 
316	presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 
317	his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 
318	taking Advil for the fever).
319	He presents for evaluation.
320	He has 
321	had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 
322	for the past two months secondary to his graft infection.
323	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.
324	MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin.
325	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
326	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 
327	179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 
328	degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.
329	There are some 
330	crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.
331	The 
332	heart has a regular rate and rhythm.
333	The abdomen is soft and 
334	non-tender, with good bowel sounds.
335	There is a right groin mass, 
336	questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.
337	The extremities 
338	are well-perfused.
339	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 
340	normal.
341	The blood sugar is 180.
342	The white count is normal at 3.7.
343	The hematocrit is 29.
344	The PT/PTT are pending.
345	The urinalysis is 
346	negative so far, with microscopic pending.
347	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery.
348	The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 
349	patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending.
350	Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 
351	history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 
352	who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 
353	a fever.
354	Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.
355	A Surgery 
356	consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 
357	pending.
358	The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 
359	Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 
360	disposition.
361	The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending.
362	CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery.
363	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever.
364	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
365	admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 
366	condition.

485	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
486	with complaints of chest pain and throat tightness.
487	The patient 
488	reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night

555	Dear Dr. Law:
556	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
557	As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
558	His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.
559	Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.
560	He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
561	The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.
562	Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.
563	Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
564	His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.
565	The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.
566	The P-wave is 5.6 mV.
567	The R-wave is 31.3 mV.
568	The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.
569	In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.
570	His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.
571	There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.
572	However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.
573	Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.
574	I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.
575	For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.
576	I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.
577	I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
578	Sincerely,

597	Dear Dr. Gordon:
598	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
599	As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
600	His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.
601	Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.
602	He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
603	The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.
604	We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.
605	He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.
606	However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.
607	He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.
608	Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
609	The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.
610	The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.
611	The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.
612	The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.
613	In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.
614	However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.
615	I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.
616	In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.
617	Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.
618	Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.
619	I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.
620	I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.
621	If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

636	Dear Dr. Swanson:
637	I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.
638	He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.
639	He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.
640	Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.
641	He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.
642	He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.
643	His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.
644	Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.
645	He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
646	We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.
647	He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.
648	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
649	Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

661	07/08/2060
662	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.
663	Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.
664	We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.
665	Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.
666	He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.
667	He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.
668	MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.
669	He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.
670	It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.
671	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.
672	His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.
673	His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.
674	His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.
675	His lung fields are clear.
676	He has no cardiac murmur.
677	There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.
678	His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.
679	In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.
680	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.
681	It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.
682	We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.
683	He will continue his efforts at weight loss.
684	He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

1220	He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report).
1221	A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal.
1222	He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA.
1223	He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine.
1224	They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined.
1225	No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.
1226	He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup.
1227	His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal.
1228	He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability.
1229	"He did have ""flashing lights in both eyes"" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then."
1230	He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.
1231	"Past Medical History	"
1232	Hypertension.
1233	He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis.
1234	He has not had his cholesterol checked.

1281	"Plan	"
1282	I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome.
1283	I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents.
1284	I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.
1285	In addition, he needs a work up.
1286	I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study.
1287	Additionally, we should check fasting lipids.
1288	He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds.
1289	He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

1295	"Reason for Visit	"
1296	Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up.
1297	I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time.
1298	He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension.
1299	He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued.
1300	He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology.
1301	He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia.
1302	His CNIS have no evidence for disease.
1303	He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.

1316	I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management.
1317	We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule.
1318	The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver.
1319	I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

1324	Dictated on: 06/14/2138 by URIEL T. ZIRKLE, MD 
1325	ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
1326	DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.
1327	HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133.
1328	At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
1329	Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans.
1330	For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy.
1331	A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
1332	CT scan was repeated in December of 2137.
1333	This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules.
1334	Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules.
1335	Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer.
1336	His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.
1337	He has met with Drs.
1338	Eagle and Yzaguirre.
1339	Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well.
1340	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
1341	1.
1342	Hypertension.
1343	2.
1344	CVA with residual weakness on the right side.
1345	He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.
1346	3.
1347	High cholesterol.
1348	CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.
1349	DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.
1350	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history.
1351	He last smoked in 2132.
1352	He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.
1353	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.
1354	PHYSICAL EXAM:
1355	No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
1356	No gynecomastia
1357	Respiration comfortable
1358	Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane.
1359	No skeletal deformity or tenderness
1360	Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
1361	Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
1362	No hernias.
1363	RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across.
1364	He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm.
1365	Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.
1366	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.
1367	Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.
1368	For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.
1369	Consent obtained today.

1393	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
1394	            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.
1395	His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.
1396	Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.
1397	He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.
1398	He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.
1399	His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.
1400	An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).
1401	His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.
1402	Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.
1403	He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.
1404	On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.
1405	He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.
1406	He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

1467	: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia
1468	#) Hyperglycemia:
1469	 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS.
1470	Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ?
1471	underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).

1475	Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.
1476	Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN
1477	#) A-fib:
1478	 New onset a-fib.
1479	Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).

1484	On ASA.
1485	Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.
1486	#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease.
1487	Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.
1488	#) Edema
1489	: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc).

1491	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc.
1492	w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.
1493	Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.
1494	#) Bullous pemphigoid
1495	: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks.

1558	Re: Nancy Werner
1559	    MRN 57274347
1560	Dear Wanda:
1561	Nancy Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May
1562	in that the triglycerides have decreased to 460, pretty much where
1563	they had usually been.
1564	The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL
1565	has declined to 34.
1566	All in all, the results are compatible with
1567	better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is
1568	likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand
1569	discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.
1570	The
1571	effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is
1572	minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated
1573	except at the high dose of 80 mg.
1574	Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could
1575	not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.
1576	Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,
1577	Procardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units
1578	A.M.
1579	Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG.
1580	460, HDL 34, LDL 93.
1581	Blood pressure is 120/80.
1582	I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d.
1583	and left her on the
1584	Atorvastatin 10 mg.
1585	Although I don't expect any side effects with
1586	this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner
1587	and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or
1588	weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication.
1589	I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.

1895	RE:  Branche, Earnest
1896	MRN: 53023691
1897	Dear Dr. Xayarath:
1898	Your patient Mr.
1899	Earnest
1900	Branche returned to the
1901	office today for a follow
1902	up visit.
1903	As you know,
1904	Mr. Branche underwent a
1905	left femoral to posterior
1906	tibial bypass one month
1907	ago followed by
1908	amputation of a
1909	gangrenous first toe.
1910	After being discharged
1911	from our service he was
1912	readmitted to the Medical
1913	Service with a severe
1914	case of C. difficile
1915	colitis.
1916	Ultimately this
1917	resolved and he was
1918	discharged.
1919	Today he
1920	reports that the diarrhea
1921	has again resumed and he
1922	was placed back on an
1923	oral antibiotic
1924	yesterday.
1925	He complains
1926	of only mild incisional
1927	discomfort in his left
1928	leg.
1929	On examination, there is
1930	a strong pulse easily
1931	palpated over the left
1932	lower extremity bypass
1933	graft.
1934	The old right
1935	graft was also palpable.
1936	The left foot itself is
1937	warm.
1938	The great toe
1939	incision site, however,
1940	has developed necrotic
1941	tissue all along the
1942	incision, which was
1943	sharply debrided to clean
1944	margins.
1945	This will now
1946	need to be treated as an
1947	open wound.
1948	The calf
1949	portion of the left lower
1950	extremity incision also
1951	has a narrow zone of
1952	superficial skin slough
1953	which was gently
1954	debrided.
1955	The graft is
1956	not exposed and there are
1957	no deep wounds in the
1958	Mr. Branche's left lower
1959	extremity bypass graft is
1960	functioning well.
1961	However, he will require
1962	significant ongoing wound
1963	care for the immediate
1964	future.
1965	Daily dressing
1966	changes will be arranged
1967	with visiting nurse
1968	services.
1969	We plan to
1970	follow him closely and an
1971	appointment was given for
1972	two weeks.
1973	Thanks again for allowing
1974	us to participate in the
1975	care of this delightful
1976	and challenging patient
1977	and please don't hesitate
1978	to contact me at any time
1979	if I can
1980	7-8-81
1981	Page 2
1982	be of further assistance.
1983	Sincerely,

2040	RE:Branch, Earnest
2041	MRN:53023691
2042	Dear Dr. Xayarath:
2043	Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up 
2044	visit.
2045	Mr.
2046	Branch is now two years out from a right femoral-
2047	tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial 
2048	bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot 
2049	and split-thickness skin grafting.
2050	Over the last several months, 
2051	he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, 
2052	superficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot.
2053	Over the 
2054	last one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new 
2055	area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and 
2056	recently has noted some drainage.
2057	He denies any fevers.
2058	In 
2059	addition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the 
2060	right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic 
2061	immediately following his visit with us.
2062	He last underwent 
2063	vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower 
2064	extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.
2065	On examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses 
2066	over both lower extremity bypass grafts.
2067	The right foot is warm 
2068	and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.
2069	On 
2070	examination of the left foot, there is a large area of full-
2071	thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where 
2072	there had never been any previous open wounds.
2073	This area 
2074	encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the 
2075	foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal 
2076	mid foot.
2077	On probing, purulent material drains from the margins 
2078	and there is obvious significant sepsis.
2079	The foot itself is warm 
2080	and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.
2081	Unfortunately, Mr.
2082	Branch has developed a new, large wound on the 
2083	left foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration 
2084	due to his severe neuropathy.
2085	This is now complicated by 
2086	significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue 
2087	loss on the foot.
2088	He will require urgent admission and operative 
2089	debridement today.
2090	In addition, given the extent of the problem, 
2091	it is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation 
2092	in the end.
2093	Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology 
2094	Clinic, he will be admitted to the
2095	3-8-82
2096	Page 2
2097	hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage 
2098	later today.
2099	I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of 
2100	his progress.
2101	Sincerely, 
2102	Luis J. Nicholas, M.D.

2108	This patient was seen primarily by Dr. Xavier Whittaker.
2109	I also saw 
2110	the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation 
2111	and plan.
2112	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.
2113	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 
2114	complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.
2115	He came 
2116	in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a 
2117	highly elevated glucose and was sent over here.
2118	The patient denies 
2119	any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he 
2120	feels poorly.
2121	Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood 
2122	sugar was noted to be greater than 600.
2123	The patient does not 
2124	complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 
2125	light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath.
2126	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note.
2127	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.
2128	Otherwise, as per the 
2129	resident's note.
2130	SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note.
2131	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, 
2132	respirations 22.
2133	The patient appears to be in no acute distress.
2134	The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.
2135	There is 
2136	jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.
2137	Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.
2138	Abdominal examination is 
2139	within normal limits.
2140	The patient has a colostomy.
2141	The patient 
2142	has a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on 
2143	the right side.
2144	Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal 
2145	abnormalities.
2146	There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.
2147	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose 
2148	of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 
2149	and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual.
2150	His pH is 7.42.
2151	CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45.
2152	Of note, however, 
2153	the patient does have renal conditions.
2154	EKG shows new deep Qs in 
2155	2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago.
2156	Chest x-ray shows 
2157	some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.
2158	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have 
2159	congestive heart failure.
2160	He may be having new cardiac event, 
2161	although after a consultation with the Integra Health
2162	cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, 
2163	but rather due to axis deviation.
2164	The patient is being treated for 
2165	his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.
2166	FINAL DIAGNOSES:
2167	1.
2168	Rule out myocardial infarction.
2169	2.
2170	Hyperglycemia.
2171	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
2172	admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

2620	"	Reason for visit:"
2621	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up.
2622	Interval History:
2623	   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.
2624	He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.
2625	He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.
2626	At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.
2627	He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.
2628	He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.
2629	His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.
2630	Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.
2631	He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.
2632	He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.
2633	He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.
2634	A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.
2635	The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.
2636	On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.
2637	A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.
2638	Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.
2639	An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.
2640	HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.
2641	His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit.
2642	ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.
2643	He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim.
2644	He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.
2645	With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.
2646	His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA.
2647	He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder.
2648	He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.
2649	Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well.
2650	He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.
2651	He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.
2652	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope.
2653	He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss.
2654	He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.
2655	He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.
2656	The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.
2657	He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.
2658	Past medical history:

2725	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis.
2726	The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.
2727	At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF.
2728	HE has evidence of severe TR on exam.
2729	From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.
2730	His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.
2731	PLAN:
2732	1.
2733	PVE endocarditis.
2734	He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement.
2735	He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID.
2736	We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today.
2737	He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.
2738	We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
2739	Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.
2740	We will continue his current dose of lasix.

2755	Hyperkalemia.
2756	Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.
2757	Ww will check follow up chem panel today.
2758	He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.

3208	(665) 578-7821                     03/06/2087
3209	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman, new patient who comes in to establish primary care and for followup of multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of foot drop, etc.
3210	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
3211	1.
3212	End-stage renal disease.
3213	Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.
3214	She resumed dialysis in 2072.
3215	She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.
3216	She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.
3217	She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.
3218	She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.
3219	Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.
3220	2.
3221	Hypertension.
3222	3.
3223	Peripheral vascular disease.
3224	She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.
3225	She apparently does not have claudication despite this.
3226	4.
3227	History of right foot-drop.
3228	She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.
3229	5.
3230	History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion.
3231	6.
3232	History of CMV colitis in 08/2081.
3233	7.
3234	Secondary hyperparathyroidism.
3235	She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.
3236	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.
3237	She is status post appendectomy.
3238	She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.
3239	MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.
3240	FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.
3241	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.
3242	She is a lifetime nonsmoker.
3243	She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.
3244	She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.
3245	She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.
3246	She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.
3247	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
3248	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.
3249	She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.
3250	She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.
3251	She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.
3252	She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.
3253	She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.
3254	She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.
3255	She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.
3256	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.
3257	Her blood pressure is 140/60.
3258	HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
3259	Extraocular movements are intact.
3260	Throat is clear.
3261	Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.
3262	Heart, regular rate and rhythm.
3263	Lungs, clear.
3264	Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.
3265	Extremities, no edema.
3266	Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.
3267	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
3268	End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.
3269	Hypertension, well controlled on medications.
3270	Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.
3271	Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.
3272	Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.
3273	Right foot-drop.
3274	We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.
3275	Left shoulder pain.
3276	It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.
3277	We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.
3278	Hemorrhoids.
3279	8.
3280	Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.
3281	9.
3282	Health maintenance.
3283	Mammogram was done in 06/2086.
3284	Pap smear was done in 04/2083.
3285	Colonoscopy was done in 08/2081.
3286	10.  ?
3287	Depression.
3288	She seemed a little sad.
3289	Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos.
3290	Will have her come back and discuss further.

3401	The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Peacock.
3402	Resident's note was reviewed.
3403	The patient was seen and examined
3404	by me.
3405	Please see the resident's note for details of the
3406	patient's past medical, social, family history, review of
3407	systems, and physical exam.
3408	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.
3409	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with
3410	end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with
3411	bleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for
3412	dialysis that started today at dialysis.
3413	When the patient pulled
3414	up her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed.
3415	Blood pressure is 112/60.
3416	The bleeding can be controlled with
3417	compression and so she presented to the Emergency Department
3418	where she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.
3419	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic
3420	stenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and
3421	tricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,
3422	foot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,
3423	secondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery
3424	disease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of
3425	35-40%.
3426	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract
3427	surgery, ovarian cyst removal.
3428	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.
3429	She
3430	is retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.
3431	FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.
3432	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
3433	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital
3434	signs.
3435	She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest
3436	examination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over
3437	the fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would
3438	not controlled with pressure.
3439	LABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.
3440	Chem-7
3441	is otherwise normal.
3442	Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.
3443	Chest x-ray
3444	shows no acute disease.
3445	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair
3446	her fistula.
3447	She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle
3448	nature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her

3803	"History of Present Illness	"
3804	Mr.
3805	Weeks is a 78 yr. old male who was admitted for further cardiac testing.
3806	His PMH includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
3807	He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.
3808	He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.
3809	He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course.
3810	"He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some ""indigestion"" the past few days."
3811	It usually occurs in the morning.
3812	He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).
3813	This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.
3814	An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.
3815	His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.
3816	A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.
3817	The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.
3818	His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.
3819	The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.
3820	LV function preserved.

4089	Dear Thomas:
4090	  Thank you very much for referring Mr.
4091	Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
4092	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
4093	Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
4094	The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
4095	After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.
4096	It has been progressive over the last several months.
4097	He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
4098	He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.
4099	He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.
4100	Past medical history:
4101	   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.
4102	Hypertension.
4103	Hypercholesterolemia.
4104	Hyperhomocysteinemia.
4105	Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4106	Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4107	Gout.
4108	Renal insufficiency.
4109	Mild thrombocytopenia.
4110	Current Medications:
4111	  atenolol 25 mg BID
4112	 Coumadin; Dir: as directed
4113	 Ecotrin 325 mg qd
4114	 Lipitor 20 mg qd
4115	 Lasix 120 mg qd
4116	 folate 1 mg qd
4117	 allopurinol 100 mg qd
4118	 Ativan
4119	 Proscar
4120	 free text medications; Dir: Insulin
4121	 Protonix
4122	Allergies:
4123	No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.
4124	Family history:
4125	   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.
4126	There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.
4127	Social history:
4128	   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.
4129	He does not drink alcohol.
4130	He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
4131	Review of systems:
4132	   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
4133	He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
4134	He denies hematochezia.
4135	He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.
4136	He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.
4137	He denies dysuria or hematuria.
4138	He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
4139	Physical examination:
4140	-Pulse:   55 and regular
4141	-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
4142	-resp.
4143	rate:   12 and unlabored
4144	-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.
4145	Mucous membranes are moist.
4146	Trachea is midline
4147	-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.
4148	Carotids are 2+ without bruits.
4149	Have a normal upstroke.
4150	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
4151	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
4152	He does have low dullness in both bases
4153	-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
4154	He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
4155	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
4156	No organomegaly.
4157	No pulsatile masses
4158	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
4159	He has no pedal edema.
4160	He has no clubbing or cyanosis
4161	Procedures:
4162	Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
4163	His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
4164	Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
4165	He had no chest pain.
4166	Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
4167	The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
4168	EKG:
4169	    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
4170	Selected recent labs:
4171	 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.
4172	Assessment and plan:
4173	   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096.
4174	His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
4175	There are a number of factors involved here.
4176	He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
4177	I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.
4178	He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
4179	He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
4180	He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
4181	He also has low platelets.
4182	The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
4183	It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
4184	He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.
4185	Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
4186	He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
4187	My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
4188	He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
4189	I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.
4190	I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.
4191	Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
4192	Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

4217	     MR#471-90-84-7
4218	Dear Dr. Geiger:
4219	Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a
4220	preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071.
4221	As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
4222	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
4223	She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and
4224	brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has
4225	increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
4226	she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September
4227	of this year.
4228	In terms of her cardiac history, she was well
4229	until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath
4230	and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart
4231	failure.
4232	At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which
4233	revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to
4234	shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a
4235	dilated left ventricle.
4236	In addition, she had an echo in June of
4237	2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral
4238	regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
4239	She has never been hospitalized since that time for her
4240	congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good
4241	result.
4242	She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or
4243	claudication.
4244	She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
4245	In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her
4246	recollection.
4247	She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house
4248	and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs.
4249	She is
4250	able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty
4251	from chest 
4252	Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

4254	pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops
4255	secondary to fatigue.
4256	Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
4257	CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
4258	She has never had
4259	surgery.
4260	Her family history is significant for a mother who died
4261	of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
4262	Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for
4263	40 years and quit four years ago.
4264	She denies alcohol, intravenous
4265	drugs or cocaine use.
4266	She lives with her husband and briefly
4267	worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.
4268	She
4269	has no known drug allergies.
4270	Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril
4271	50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po
4272	QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily
4273	and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.
4274	On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in
4275	her left arm and 165/70 in her right.
4276	Her heart rate was 104 when
4277	I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today.
4278	Her JVP was 7
4279	centimeters.
4280	Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid
4281	bruits.
4282	Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
4283	Her
4284	heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with
4285	occasional ectopic beats.
4286	She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6
4287	systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without
4288	radiation.
4289	Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
4290	extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
4291	Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
4292	She has a
4293	diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin
4294	effects.
4295	She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old
4296	anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
4297	In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
4298	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
4299	with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,
4300	likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial
4301	infarction, although she has never undergone heart
4302	catheterization.
4303	She is currently undergoing evaluation for a
4304	thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
4305	MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071
4306	Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 
4307	given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
4308	since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with
4309	imaging.
4310	If this is similar to her previous study showing only
4311	fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she
4312	will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative
4313	myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is
4314	well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having
4315	Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection
4316	fraction.
4317	She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection
4318	As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation
4319	and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or
4320	rhythm.
4321	Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days
4322	prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after
4323	surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons
4324	as to how may days she should wait after surgery before
4325	restarting that medication.
4326	She will otherwise remain on her
4327	current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and
4328	primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.
4329	If her stress test
4330	is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for
4331	further evaluation.
4332	Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
4333	She was seen
4334	and examined with Dr. Voss.

4349	November 24, 2071
4350	This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 
4351	for management of papillary thyroid cancer.
4352	Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 
4353	when she felt a prominence in her neck.
4354	She did not experience any dysphagia 
4355	or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 
4356	examination.
4357	She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 
4358	hospital.
4359	The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 
4360	cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
4361	She was 
4362	subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 
4363	thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.
4364	The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 
4365	was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 
4366	reimplanted.
4367	According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 
4368	locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.
4369	The 
4370	pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 
4371	lymphovascular invasion.
4372	There was an additional focus of papillary 
4373	carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.
4374	Of 
4375	note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.
4376	The tumor 
4377	did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
4378	Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.
4379	She has been 
4380	maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.
4381	She says that she feels generally 
4382	well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.
4383	She denies any 
4384	changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.
4385	She does endorse a one pound 
4386	weight gain over the last two months.
4387	She denies any paresthesias or other 
4388	symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.
4389	She denies any history of thyroid 
4390	disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.
4391	She is now referred for 
4392	consideration of radioiodine ablation.
4393	Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.
4394	She has an 
4395	ejection fraction of 25%.
4396	She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 
4397	hypertension, and anxiety.
4398	No history of childhood irradiation.
4399	Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 
4400	mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 
4401	captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.
4402	Allergies:No known drug allergies.
4403	Social History:Remote history of tobacco.
4404	She quit 4 years ago.
4405	She 
4406	endorses rare alcohol use.
4407	She is married with four children.
4408	Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.
4409	Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.
4410	Weight 208.
4411	Pulse 
4412	88.
4413	In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 
4414	NAD.
4415	HEENT:  PERRLA.
4416	EOMI.
4417	No proptosis or lid lag.
4418	Neck: supple with a 
4419	large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.
4420	No 
4421	Page 2
4422	remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
4423	Lungs: clear to 
4424	auscultation bilaterally.
4425	Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 
4426	rhythm.
4427	Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.
4428	Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.
4429	Neurologic: reflexes are 
4430	slightly delayed.
4431	There is no tremor of outstretched hands.
4432	Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 
4433	prior to surgery.
4434	Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.
4435	Calcium prior to 
4436	surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 
4437	surgery were in the mid-8 range.
4438	Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 
4439	failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.
4440	Ms. 
4441	Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 
4442	older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 
4443	multifocal disease.
4444	Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.
4445	We suspect that 
4446	she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.
4447	I have recommended 
4448	131I treatment.
4449	Benefits and risks were discussed.
4450	In addition, I think she 
4451	would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.
4452	TSH and calcium were drawn today.
4453	We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

4473	Dear Dr. Van:
4474	I had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.
4475	This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.
4476	At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12.
4477	During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD.
4478	They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.
4479	Her medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
4480	q.d., digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
4481	q.d., captopril 50 mg p.o.
4482	t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
4483	b.i.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.

4582	speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.
4583	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a
4584	history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
4585	She presents with
4586	episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls.
4587	She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.
4588	She
4589	also had dark stools over the past few weeks.
4590	She denies any
4591	associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any
4592	syncope, any nausea or vomiting.
4593	She does have a bruise on her
4594	chin.
4595	She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.
4596	No
4597	hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.
4598	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial
4599	fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
4600	hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.
4601	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.
4602	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,
4603	otherwise negative.
4604	MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,
4605	and digoxin.
4606	ALLERGIES:  None.
4607	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory
4608	rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air.
4609	General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm
4610	ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left
4611	shoulder.
4612	Her pupils are reactive.
4613	Neck is supple.
4614	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.
4615	Cardiovascular:  Regular
4616	rate.
4617	Abdomen is soft.
4618	Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive
4619	melena per the resident.
4620	Skin is otherwise with bruises over the
4621	left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears
4622	healing.
4623	Extremities are with good range of motion.
4624	No focal
4625	tenderness.
4626	She is oriented x3.
4627	Mood and affect are normal.
4628	She is moving all extremities equally.
4629	LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal
4630	process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial
4631	abnormalities.
4632	Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit
4633	of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and
4634	platelets of 358.
4635	INR of 2.
4636	Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no
4637	blood.
4638	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents
4639	with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent
4640	falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process
4641	such as a subdural or stroke.
4642	This has been going on for several
4643	weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past
4644	several weeks and profound anemia for which she required
4645	transfusion in the Emergency Department.
4646	We did order a CT of
4647	the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both
4648	given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.
4649	This
4650	does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.
4651	She is quite
4652	anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.
4653	I suspect this is the
4654	etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and
4655	concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could
4656	represent coronary insufficiency.
4657	She does not have an elevated
4658	troponin at present.
4659	She will need to be further monitored.
4660	was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her
4661	profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.
4662	Clinically, feels better.
4663	I discussed with the patient's family
4664	because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____
4665	further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as
4666	physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical
4667	issues have been addressed.
4668	She will be admitted to the medical
4669	service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal
4670	bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in
4671	stable condition.

4683	"RE:		Jarvis, Amador"
4684	"PCC#:		090-73-07"
4685	January 20, 2088
4686	Reason for visit:  Mr. Jarvis comes to follow up on his hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and elevated PSA.
4687	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.
4688	This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.
4689	He began the Captopril and HCTZ (?
4690	or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.
4691	At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.
4692	He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.
4693	His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.
4694	On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.
4695	He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this.
4696	He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.
4697	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.
4698	His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.
4699	His weight is 173 (stable).
4700	IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.
4701	Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.
4702	We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.
4703	He will return in four months for follow up.
4704	Orvell Oliver, M.D.
4705	Labs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.
4706	Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.
4707	If the latter, will change it.

4722	REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
4723	visit.
4724	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
4725	any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.
4726	He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.
4727	He and his wife are 
4728	planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
4729	long weekends in New Mexico.
4730	He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.
4731	The pains in his hips 
4732	and legs have not been bothering him.
4733	When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
4734	gets results that range between 170 and 120.
4735	He has not been specifically 
4736	exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
4737	and walk the intervening distance.
4738	He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
4739	per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.
4740	Otherwise, the review of systems is 
4741	unremarkable.
4742	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.
4743	Blood pressure in the 
4744	right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.
4745	Chest is clear to P&A.
4746	Heart 
4747	sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.
4748	Neck 
4749	veins are not distended.
4750	Abdomen is nontender.
4751	Extremities have good dorsalis 
4752	pedis pulses.
4753	Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.
4754	IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.
4755	He remains 
4756	moderately hyperglycemic.
4757	He has an appointment to be followed by the 
4758	urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
4759	specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
4760	considered only a risk factor).
4761	PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
4762	the results are available.
4763	He should return in 6 months.

4779	Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.
4780	I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).
4781	I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.
4782	If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.
4783	Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.
4784	I don't think this will interfere with your trip.
4785	Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.
4786	Best wishes,

5053	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
5054	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
5055	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
5056	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
5057	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
5058	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
5059	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
5060	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
5061	He never developed chest pain.
5062	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
5063	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
5064	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
5065	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
5066	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
5067	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
5068	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
5069	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
5070	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
5071	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
5072	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
5073	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
5074	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
5075	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.
5076	He denies any calf pain.

5191	HPI:   Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ a PMH notable for COPD w/ FEV1/FVC=63%, HOCM s/p MVR and septal myomectomy in 2085 who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past 4 days.
5192	Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.
5193	She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.
5194	She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.
5195	On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.
5196	She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.
5197	"Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..	"
5198	"	EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance."
5199	In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.
5200	She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.
5201	She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.
5202	Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.
5203	She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.
5204	Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.
5205	She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.
5206	She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.
5207	ROS:   No F/C, + NS.

5211	No delta MS/LOC.
5212	No slurring of speech, unilateral weakness.
5213	No dysuria.
5214	Hospital Course: Patient had TTE performed on 7/24/91 which showed increase trans-mitral valve gradient.
5215	Given patient's history of MVR, TEE was recommended.
5216	On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head.
5217	No change in MS.
5218	In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds.
5219	On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted.
5220	Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91.
5221	On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning.
5222	On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night.
5223	This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC.
5224	ABG was performed which showed 7.48/52/50.
5225	After speaking to cardiology, decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU for intubation prior to cardiac cath this PM.
5226	A TEE will be performed while patient is intubated.
5227	Patient is currently NPO ready for cath this PM.

5350	Impression:
5351	Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ multiple medical problems including HOCM, s/p MVR and myomectomy as well as COPD who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past four days.
5352	Of note, the patient notes increasing DOE for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.
5353	Her progressive DOE may be related to CHF, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on EKG however, her acute decompensation may be related to COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.
5354	Plan: 
5355	SOB- Unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial
5356	--Treat COPD w/ Atrovent nebs, prednisone, O2, Levaquin
5357	--Patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so Albuterol was DC'ed
5358	--Follow urine output secondary to IV Lasix
5359	--Daily weights, strict Is and Os
5360	--Keep O2 sats 88-90% 
5361	EKG changes- Pt w/o known history of CAD however w/ and ST depressions on EKG that appear rate related
5362	--IV Lopressor to decrease rate
5363	--ASA
5364	--Cardiac monitor
5365	--Cardiac cath per Dr. Janssen with TEE
5366	MVR- On Coumadin
5367	--Follow INR
5368	Trigeminal neuralgia- Improving w/ pain control and Tegretol
5369	--Continue current management
5370	FEN- 
5371	--Encourage Pos
5372	--Replete lytes as needed
5373	Prophylaxis- Nexium, Coumadin

5693	Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.
5694	She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis.
5695	Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.
5696	Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder.
5697	Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital.
5698	She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively.
5699	She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight.
5700	Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range.
5701	Since her last visit, she has done well at home.
5702	Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes.
5703	However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion.
5704	She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC.
5705	She feels more energetic after this.
5706	She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.
5707	She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry.
5708	This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

6007	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
6008	60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.
6009	For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.
6010	No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.
6011	Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.
6012	Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.
6013	Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.
6014	Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.
6015	1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.
6016	This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.
6017	Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.
6018	May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.
6019	No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.
6020	Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.
6021	- Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight
6022	 - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff
6023	 - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax
6024	 - Reglan PRN nausea
6025	- Follow clinical exam
6026	 - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia
6027	 - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)
6028	 - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)
6029	 - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea
6030	2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.
6031	No evidence of abdominal mass other than fibroids.
6032	- Continue on tamoxifen 20 mg PO QAM
6033	3) Psychiatric:  Depression & anxiety
6034	 - Buspar
6035	 - clonazepam
6036	 - effexor
6037	4) DM2:  Continue home meds (metformin + insulin), hold when on diet without substantial calories (clears, NPO)
6038	5) Prophylaxis:  patient is ambulatory; ranitidine; commode by bedside.

6379	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.
6380	Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.
6381	TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).
6382	DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).
6383	The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.
6384	Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.
6385	She is currently CP free.
6386	1.
6387	Chest pain
6388	-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now
6389	-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.
6390	Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
6391	-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult
6392	-     TTE in AM
6393	-     Check amylase, lipase 
6394	-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM
6395	-     Smoking cessation consult
6396	2.
6397	Lupus-like condition
6398	-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM
6399	3.
6400	DM
6401	-     Check HbA1c
6402	-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS
6403	4.
6404	Renal
6405	-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate
6406	5.
6407	Psych
6408	-     continue home regimen &#8211; klonopin, effexor, topamax

6418	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.
6419	Chest pain.
6420	The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.
6421	He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.
6422	The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.
6423	He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.
6424	The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.
6425	He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.
6426	The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.
6427	It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.
6428	Left renal lesion.
6429	As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.
6430	The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.
6431	I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.
6432	Diabetes mellitus type 2.
6433	The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.
6434	Obstructive sleep apnea.
6435	The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.
6436	Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.
6437	Elevated blood pressure.
6438	The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.
6439	Gastroesophageal reflux.
6440	The patient feels well on Zantac.
6441	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.
6442	He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.
6443	He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.
6444	He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.
6445	He has no burning on urination.
6446	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.
6447	His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.
6448	Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.
6449	The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.
6450	The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.
6451	The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.
6452	Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.
6453	Abdomen is soft.
6454	No liver or spleen was felt.
6455	Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
6456	Neurologically, the patient was alert.
6457	The patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.
6458	The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.
6459	1.
6460	Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
6461	2.
6462	New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.
6463	3.
6464	Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.
6465	4.
6466	Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
6467	5.
6468	Abnormal LFTs by history.
6469	6.
6470	Diabetes mellitus.
6471	7.
6472	Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.

6836	Dear Dr. Barron:
6837	Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
6838	I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
6839	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
6840	Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
6841	It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
6842	On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
6843	She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
6844	I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
6845	Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
6846	Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
6847	Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.
6848	She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
6849	Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
6850	She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
6851	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.
6852	Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.
6853	She has no known drug allergies.
6854	Social History:  She is married and has three children.
6855	She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
6856	Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
6857	She has never used tobacco.
6858	Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
6859	There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
6860	Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
6861	Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
6862	All others are negative.
6863	On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
6864	Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
6865	Her weight is 213 pounds.
6866	Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
6867	There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
6868	The carotid upstrokes are full.
6869	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
6870	The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
6871	The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
6872	The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.
6873	Her extremities show no edema.
6874	Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
6875	She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
6876	I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
6877	On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.
6878	She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
6879	She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
6880	There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
6881	She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
6882	In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
6883	She did receive drug-eluting stents.
6884	The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
6885	What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
6886	From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
6887	She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
6888	I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
6889	To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
6890	We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
6891	In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
6892	The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
6893	In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.
6894	Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
6895	After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
6896	However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
6897	She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.
6898	The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.
6899	This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
6900	I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
6901	Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
6902	If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

6917	Dear Dr. Barron:
6918	I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.
6919	As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.
6920	We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.
6921	We utilized the right radial artery for access.
6922	We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.
6923	This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.
6924	We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.
6925	The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.
6926	The final angiographic result was excellent.
6927	The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.
6928	She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.
6929	I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.
6930	If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.
6931	Sincerely,

7051	Patient is here for a follow-up.
7052	Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.
7053	Says
7054	that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people
7055	for transportation.
7056	Still has severe right shoulder pain.
7057	Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is
7058	worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.
7059	Reviewed x-rays, which were
7060	negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in
7061	the TMJ area.
7062	Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this
7063	shoulder pain.
7064	Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she
7065	could not take it with ibuprofen.
7066	I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in
7067	place of the ibuprofen and she understands.
7068	Is not willing to try Flexeril.
7069	Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult
7070	interactions with her children.
7071	Has not asked for more Valium.
7072	Has never been
7073	interested in counseling prior to today.
7074	Did not become tearful like she has in the
7075	past.
7076	Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.
7077	Prescription apparently was given to her
7078	last spring.
7079	Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.
7080	No clear to me what
7081	causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves
7082	her symptoms.
7083	I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain
7084	that is reproducible when she touches her chest.
7085	The patient seems to label her chest
7086	wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.
7087	PROBLEMS: As per LMR.
7088	MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.
7089	ALLERGIES: As per LMR.
7090	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD.

7106	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
7107	(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter
7108	     Mccarthy.
7109	Referral done.
7110	Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.
7111	(2)  Elevated blood pressure.
7112	Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated.
7113	At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.
7114	Think she may need
7115	     this at future visit.
7116	Will also refer back to her cardiologist.
7117	(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year.
7118	Several medications that patient appears
7119	     to be sensitive to side effects.
7120	At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting
7121	     profile.
7122	Positive checkup.
7123	Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.
7124	(4)  Leg cramps.
7125	Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25
7126	     years of leg cramps.
7127	Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction.
7128	Patient already takes Valium p.r.n.
7129	and I am reluctant to start any other
7130	     anxiolytics.
7131	Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit.
7132	(5)  History of sciatica.
7133	Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection
7134	     for her lower back pain, which resolved.
7135	Will simply follow with Vioxx, which
7136	     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.
7137	Also continue with
7138	     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and
7139	     chronic low back pain.
7140	Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks.
7141	ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell
7142	me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

7170	Explained to her the
7171	importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.
7172	Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas.

7347	A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.
7348	The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.
7349	She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms.
7350	I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.
7351	"P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of ""blockage"" means and about prognosis."
7352	I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).
7353	I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID.
7354	I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.
7355	Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.
7356	Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.
7357	Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead.
7358	She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8/27.
7359	Length of visit was 45 minutes.

7367	NOTE
7368	     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.
7369	She is now 52 and
7370	has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
7371	OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.
7372	She
7373	had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
7374	well since that time.
7375	Over the past year she has not been as
7376	careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
7377	sugars regularly.
7378	A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
7379	300.
7380	She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
7381	anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
7382	diaphoresis or light-headedness.
7383	There has not been any reduction
7384	in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
7385	ago and is working full-time.
7386	There has been no orthopnea, PND or
7387	peripheral edema.
7388	She is interested in increasing her physical
7389	activity program.
7390	Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
7391	20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
7392	developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.
7393	She is
7394	perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
7395	gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
7396	Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
7397	EXAM
7398	     She is comfortable at rest.

7406	Abd.
7407	soft w/o
7408	organomegaly.
7409	No peripheral edema.
7410	Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
7411	and is a normal tracing.
7412	For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
7413	gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
7414	using the standard bruce protocol.
7415	She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
7416	seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
7417	chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.
7418	Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
7419	maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure.
7420	There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
7421	load.
7422	Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
7423	seconds longer.
7424	IMPRESSION
7425	     1.
7426	No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time.
7427	She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
7428	hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
7429	perimenopausal state.
7430	She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
7431	her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
7432	profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
7433	PAGE 2
7434	instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.
7435	From a cardiac
7436	standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.
7437	Low
7438	dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
7439	I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
7440	evaluation as needed in the future.

7542	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a
7543	new apartment.
7544	She is actually in the process of moving.
7545	She recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited
7546	about the fact that, during the course of the week, she went
7547	out to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her
7548	friend.
7549	Her sugars are still not well controlled.
7550	She has been
7551	liberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate.
7552	I
7553	did increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30/70, and
7554	suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime
7555	to 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give
7556	her a little better coverage for her evening meal.
7557	I wrote
7558	a note to the nurse to actuate this change.
7559	They actually
7560	called me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed
7561	this with them, at length, at that time, including the
7562	rationale for this change.
7563	She is not having any exertional or other chest pain.
7564	No
7565	orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema.
7566	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80.
7567	Heart rate
7568	68 and regular.
7569	Respirations 14.
7570	Venous pressure 3.
7571	Clear
7572	chest.
7573	S4, no S3.
7574	No retrosternal dullness or rub.
7575	She
7576	has only a trace of ankle edema.
7577	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Her verbal skills have improved.
7578	got very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills,
7579	and was able to give me the days of the week forward, but
7580	not backwards.
7581	I did not push her beyond that.
7582	I did tell
7583	her that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks'
7584	time, to see if last increment had returned her to a
7585	euthyroid state.

7695	Dear Dr. You:
7696	Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.
7697	Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.
7698	He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.
7699	He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.
7700	After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.
7701	He denies any history of trauma.
7702	He is a former smoker.
7703	He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.
7704	He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.
7705	Past surgical history is as above.
7706	Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.
7707	No known drug allergies.
7708	Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.
7709	All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.
7710	Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.
7711	He denies alcohol use.
7712	Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.
7713	On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.
7714	Respiratory rate is 12-14.
7715	Pulse is 60-70 and regular.
7716	Weight is 172 pounds.
7717	Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.
7718	No jugular venous distention.
7719	Normal respiratory effort.
7720	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
7721	Heart, regular rate and rhythm.
7722	No murmur or bruit.
7723	He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.
7724	He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.
7725	Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.
7726	On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.
7727	He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.
7728	No varicosities.
7729	He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.
7730	The right great toe is blanched.
7731	He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.
7732	He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.
7733	He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.
7734	Assessment and Plan:  
7735	1.
7736	Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.
7737	We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.
7738	We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.
7739	If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.
7740	2.
7741	Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.
7742	3.
7743	Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.
7744	His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.
7745	We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.
7746	4.
7747	Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
7748	The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.
7749	I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.
7750	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.
7751	If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.
7752	Sincerely,

7761	"RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb"
7762	"SRI: 		134-43-51"
7763	Dear Dr. You:
7764	I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Jaquante Xuereb, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today.
7765	As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery.
7766	He returns today for follow up evaluation.
7767	He has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
7768	Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.
7769	He had been on a course of p.o.
7770	antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.
7771	The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg.
7772	My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate.
7773	We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis.
7774	In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.
7775	He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.
7776	Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.
7777	I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.
7778	My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.
7779	If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.
7780	Sincerely,
7781	Shane R. Herring, M.D.

7786	Dictated on: 04/27/2071 by LILLIAN STEELE, N.P., PH.D. 
7787	Mr. Xuereb returns to clinic for evaluation and management of recurrent ulcerations on the hypertrophic scar tissue along the medial aspect of the right lower extremity.
7788	Today, on physical examination, the wound bed measured 1 cm x 0.7 cm.
7789	The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided.
7790	The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage.
7791	The margin was clear.
7792	IMPRESSION:  There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee.
7793	There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.
7794	"PLAN:  We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1/8"" thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape."
7795	Mr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.

7888	Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load.
7889	There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations.
7890	No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand.
7891	Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place.
7892	As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.
7893	Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR).
7894	Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation.
7895	Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues
7896	Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI.
7897	Follow markers.
7898	Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.
7899	Have request FMC records.
7900	Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath.
7901	Heparin,

7993	Last year she did go

8005	history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip

8386	RE:  Gerald, Marion 
8387	MRN: 48967301 
8388	DOV: 05/18/83
8389	Dear Dr. Olive,
8390	Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.
8391	She is 
8392	referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.
8393	The patient states she is 
8394	currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 
8395	developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.
8396	This continued to bother her 
8397	and she eventually was treated with steroids.
8398	I am not sure she had a 
8399	diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.
8400	She then was switched to ibuprofen which 
8401	did not work particularly well.
8402	Over this time, she would have intermittent 
8403	episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 
8404	her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.
8405	She was seen by 
8406	Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 
8407	"she had ""25 shots"" of steroids."
8408	She denies any hot or swollen joints.
8409	She 
8410	has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.
8411	Extensive ROS reveals 
8412	no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.
8413	has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 
8414	well.
8415	She has continued to be concerned about that.
8416	She has had fevers or 
8417	chills but no temperature elevation.
8418	She has intermittent abdominal pain but 
8419	has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.
8420	She has 
8421	morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.
8422	Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.
8423	Mother is 
8424	85.
8425	Two sons alive and well.
8426	Two siblings alive and well except for 
8427	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
8428	Past medical history is pertinent for above.
8429	She has had a partial 
8430	hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.
8431	Medications 
8432	include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 
8433	metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 
8434	q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.
8435	No smoking or drinking history.
8436	No allergies.
8437	No other medical problems.
8438	Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.
8439	She works as a 
8440	midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.
8441	Her husband is 
8442	a Broadcast Technician.
8443	They have traveled quite a bit because of this.
8444	Page 2
8445	Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.
8446	Weight 152.
8447	BP 
8448	120/80.
8449	She had a respiratory rate of 16.
8450	She had full range of motion of 
8451	all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 
8452	cervical and lumbar area.
8453	Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.
8454	No oral ulcerations.
8455	Good salivary pool.
8456	No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 
8457	or axillary adenopathy.
8458	Chest: clear to A&P.
8459	No carotid bruits.
8460	Vascular 
8461	exam: normal.
8462	Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.
8463	Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
8464	Extremities: without 
8465	edema.
8466	I suspect she has fibromyalgia.
8467	I do not really know the place of steroids 
8468	in this setting.
8469	I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 
8470	CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.
8471	I will see her back in four 
8472	to six weeks.
8473	She will get old records for me to review.
8474	We will talk about 
8475	what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 
8476	have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.
8477	I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.
8478	Sincerely yours,

8495	Dear Dr. Higgins,
8496	Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary
8497	care.
8498	I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.
8499	She
8500	comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.
8501	Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.
8502	She has
8503	been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what
8504	she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had
8505	planned.
8506	However, she has other medical problems which I will
8507	deal with until she sees you.
8508	At her last visit, there was a
8509	"question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not"
8510	given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.
8511	However,
8512	she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,
8513	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include
8514	metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20
8515	q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.
8516	Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces
8517	her pain.
8518	She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
8519	HEENT
8520	was otherwise unremarkable.
8521	I obtained blood studies which
8522	revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62
8523	and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8
8524	with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of
8525	14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.
8526	A1c
8527	pending.
8528	A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did
8529	not reveal proteinuria or sediment.
8530	HBsAG and HCV are pending as
8531	well.
8532	I will be in touch with her regarding these results.
8533	I was
8534	wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of
8535	these abnormalities outlined.
8536	Thanks for letting me participate
8537	in her care.
8538	Sincerely yours,

8551	(449) 515-0294
8552	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest
8553	pain.
8554	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient
8555	with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,
8556	hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous
8557	doctor, Yesenia Olive.
8558	The following issues addressed:
8559	1.
8560	Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any
8561	symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.
8562	Maintained on Glucophage
8563	1000 mg b.i.d.
8564	Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day
8565	is around 120.
8566	We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.
8567	Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.
8568	2.
8569	Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will
8570	be less than a 100.
8571	She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day
8572	and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256.
8573	We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.
8574	3.
8575	Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is
8576	acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.
8577	4.
8578	Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood
8579	pressure is currently acceptable.
8580	5.
8581	Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation
8582	rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in
8583	the past.
8584	No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a
8585	history of recent chest pain.
8586	6.
8587	Exercise-induced chest pain.
8588	The patient has noted over the
8589	past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest
8590	when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.
8591	This
8592	subsides when she stops and rests for a while.
8593	This has been
8594	reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her
8595	husband.
8596	Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had
8597	thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted
8598	heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.
8599	EKG showed 1 mm ST
8600	depression in leads II and V4 through 6.
8601	The thallium scan
8602	showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior
8603	walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending
8604	artery distribution.
8605	She does not recall having symptoms at that
8606	time.
8607	Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with
8608	chest discomfort.
8609	There are some radiation into both shoulders
8610	and neck.
8611	Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,
8612	diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.
8613	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,
8614	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro
8615	150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d.
8616	and Glucophage 500 mg two
8617	tabs b.i.d.
8618	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
8619	SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.
8620	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel
8621	habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.
8622	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.
8623	Temperature
8624	of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.
8625	Pupils are equal,
8626	round and reactive.
8627	Conjunctivae clear.
8628	Sclerae anicteric.
8629	Oropharynx benign.
8630	Neck is supple.
8631	No neck vein distention.
8632	Thyroid is not palpable.
8633	Chest is clear to percussion and
8634	auscultation.
8635	Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,
8636	thrill or gallop.
8637	Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds
8638	and no organomegaly.
8639	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or
8640	edema.
8641	Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
8642	No
8643	abnormal complex.
8644	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
8645	Diabetes.
8646	We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she
8647	has had an ophthalmologic follow up.
8648	Maintain Glucophage.
8649	Elevated cholesterol.
8650	Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.
8651	Chest pain.
8652	Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.
8653	I have
8654	contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an
8655	ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.
8656	I prescribed nitroglycerin
8657	1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes.
8658	x 3 for chest
8659	discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.
8660	Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add
8661	beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing
8662	heart block.
8663	Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current
8664	Levoxyl.
8665	The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and
8666	cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

8679	(449) 515-0294
8680	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.
8681	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
8682	1.
8683	The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in
8684	today having just had a stress test.
8685	Stress test showed that she
8686	was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds
8687	achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,
8688	stopped for fatigue.
8689	Immediately after exercise, she did have
8690	some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.
8691	There were no EKG changes.
8692	The patient reports that she has been
8693	walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise
8694	level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had
8695	precipitated the hospitalization initially.
8696	She is looking into
8697	cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.
8698	She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.
8699	She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a
8700	healthy lifestyle.
8701	She has returned to work.
8702	She has follow up
8703	scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.
8704	2.
8705	Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her
8706	Glucophage 2000 mg a day.
8707	She monitors blood sugars but only in
8708	the morning.
8709	Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.
8710	However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically
8711	sweating and abdominal discomfort.
8712	She has never actually
8713	checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to
8714	occur at work.
8715	She has not had any fainting or dizziness.
8716	3.
8717	Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.
8718	4.
8719	Hypertension.
8720	At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose
8721	because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and
8722	currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.
8723	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,
8724	atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,
8725	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,
8726	Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage
8727	500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.
8728	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
8729	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness
8730	of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
8731	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in
8732	good spirits.
8733	Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is
8734	70 and regular.
8735	Conjunctivae are clear.
8736	Sclerae are anicteric.
8737	Neck is supple.
8738	No neck vein distention.
8739	Chest is clear to
8740	percussion and auscultation.
8741	Heart: Regular rhythm.
8742	S1 and S2.
8743	No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.
8744	Extremities are without
8745	clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
8746	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
8747	Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty
8748	with stenting.
8749	Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.
8750	At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac
8751	rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.
8752	Diabetes, seems as though her control is 
8753	impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.
8754	We will
8755	discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.
8756	Elevated cholesterol.
8757	We will check on lipid status in four
8758	weeks' time.
8759	On current medications with target of LDL less than
8760	100.
8761	Blood pressure acceptable on current medical
8762	regimen.

9068	MRN:      0887181
9069	Becka returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
9070	She showed me a foot ulcer
9071	that she has had since early August.
9072	In fact, this was debrided on August 9 by Dr.
9073	Noyes and was found to contain Staph aureus sensitive to oxacillin and Bactrim.
9074	She was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement.
9075	She has not
9076	had any fever.
9077	She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet.
9078	On exam, the second toe on the right foot is severely swollen and red.
9079	There is an
9080	ulcer which looks quite deep on the medial aspect of the toe.
9081	I had Dr. Drew
9082	take a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room.
9083	IMPRESSION:  Cellulitis/right toe ulcer - Persistent infection and unresponsiveness
9084	to 2-week course of Augmentin raise concern of underlying osteomyelitis.
9085	Rebecca
9086	was referred into the emergency room for further evaluation.
9087	She also was given a
9088	new prescription for her Percocet #100.
9089	I will see her in follow-up in 1 month.

9096	FOLLOW-UP VISIT  
9097	Patient returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
9098	Since last seen, her Dilantin level came back at 18.8.
9099	She feels her pain has been
9100	under relatively good control.
9101	She has had a few falls since she was last seen all
9102	due to losing her balance or tripping.
9103	No lightheadedness or vertigo preceding her
9104	falls.
9105	She is trying to be more careful to avoid future falls by watching closely
9106	where she is walking.
9107	She has no active infection at present.
9108	She is scheduled for follow-up EMG nerve
9109	conduction studies in January.
9110	ON EXAM:  She is her usual pleasant self.
9111	Examination of the feet shows
9112	hammertoes, numerous bunions, some reddened calluses but no ulcers or open
9113	lesions.
9114	There is vibratory loss to the ankles and absent ankle jerks bilaterally.
9115	IMPRESSION:  Painful neuropathy with 10-year history of progressive symptoms.
9116	Numerous previous work-ups for reversible causes of neuropathy have been
9117	negative.
9118	I would like to have her be evaluated by Dr. Phyllis Brewer of
9119	Internal Medicine to see if she has any other ideas as to any additional work-up
9120	or treatment.
9121	Of note, previously had a DENA panel for sensory neuropathy
9122	which was negative.
9123	Rebecca was given a new prescription for Percocet #100.
9124	I will
9125	see her in follow-up in two months.

9130	MRN:     0887181
9131	Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
9132	A lot has happened since she
9133	was seen.
9134	She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.
9135	She
9136	therefore has been having financial problems.
9137	She does not have enough money to
9138	buy her medications.
9139	She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
9140	She has not taken these medications for months.
9141	She states she has been taking her
9142	nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.
9143	When I called her from
9144	the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
9145	she fell.
9146	We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
9147	taken.
9148	She reports being off balance for about the past month.
9149	She has been feeling
9150	more unsteady on her feet.
9151	She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
9152	to falling.
9153	She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
9154	mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.
9155	On review of other systems, she
9156	reports a 20 lb.
9157	weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
9158	working and being at home and eating more than usual.
9159	She also notes that she has
9160	begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.
9161	She complains of excessive
9162	dry mouth.
9163	She reports being more thirsty than usual.
9164	PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.
9165	She is alert and
9166	oriented X 3.
9167	Speech fluent without aphasia.
9168	BP sitting 145/70.
9169	Pulse 80.
9170	Standing
9171	BP unchanged at 145/70.
9172	Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
9173	bilateral nystagmus.
9174	Otherwise intact.
9175	On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
9176	movements.
9177	No drift.
9178	Good power throughout.
9179	Fine finger movements intact.
9180	Vibratory loss to the ankles.
9181	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
9182	When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
9183	was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.
9184	IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
9185	medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed.
9186	Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.
9187	Her
9188	exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.
9189	Therefore I suspect toxic
9190	metabolic cause.
9191	As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
9192	screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.
9193	I will be
9194	in touch with the physicians after they see her.

9205	ID/CC:    There's a herd of elephants on my chest.
9206	"HPI: 	69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days."
9207	Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.
9208	This pain was constant,    24 hours/day   , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.
9209	This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.
9210	The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    I felt like I was about to faint.
9211	Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.
9212	The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS.
9213	Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.
9214	In the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA.
9215	EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG.
9216	IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history.
9217	D-dimer was elevated at 782.
9218	Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE.
9219	However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL.
9220	The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED.
9221	She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.
9222	ROS:  No fevers/chills.
9223	Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.
9224	The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, No hematochezia/melena.
9225	No increased frequency, no dysuria.
9226	No delta MS/LOC.

9344	RADIOLOGY
9345	Chest CT:  4/11/96
9346	"	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to"
9347	"	suggest pulmonary embolism."
9348	There are several mediastinal lymph
9349	"	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size."
9350	However, in the
9351	"	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes"
9352	"	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis."
9353	These could be
9354	"	reactive or neoplastic."
9355	There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
9356	"	node."
9357	In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
9358	"	parenchymal nodule."
9359	This is best demonstrated on image 65.
9360	This
9361	"	could possibly represent a malignancy."
9362	Alternatively this could
9363	"	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node."
9364	This does not appear to
9365	"	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less"
9366	"	likely."
9367	Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
9368	"	right lung base."
9369	There is no pneumothorax.
9370	No significant
9371	"	pleural fluid is noted."
9372	There is no pericardial fluid.
9373	IMPRESSION:
9374	"	No pulmonary embolism or DVT."
9375	There are multiple mediastinal
9376	"	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe."
9377	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
9378	A follow-up chest CT may be further
9379	"	value."
9380	These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time
9381	"	of dictation."
9382	EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.
9383	A/P:
9384	Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.
9385	This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.
9386	I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.
9387	Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
9388	CV:
9389	--Rate:  well controlled without medication.
9390	--Rhythm:  normal sinus
9391	--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.
9392	--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.
9393	Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.
9394	Will obtain stress test in AM.
9395	PULM:  
9396	--plant PPD
9397	--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.
9398	--send ANCA
9399	--follow up CT for nodule
9400	--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing
9401	ENDO:
9402	--urine metanephrines for pheo
9403	--5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid
9404	--TSH
9405	--AB-CT for evolution of adenoma
9406	--holding metformin, will control with SSIR.
9407	Prophy
9408	--Nexium
9409	--holding on fragmin for now-low threshold to resume for DVT prophy given possible oncologic diagnosis.

9411	PATIENT NAME:  MEYER, OSCAR;    MRN:  2771447
9412	Dictated on:  02/06/2095 by VICTOR M. ZUBIA, M.D.
9413	Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:
9414	DATE OF CONSULTATION:
9415	DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
9416	HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.
9417	His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.
9418	Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.
9419	He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.
9420	He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.
9421	The erections are still an important issue with him.
9422	Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.
9423	He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.
9424	In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.
9425	Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.
9426	Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.
9427	Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.
9428	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
9429	1.
9430	Diabetes.
9431	2.
9432	Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.
9433	3.
9434	Tonsillectomy.
9435	4.
9436	Right inguinal hernia repair.
9437	5.
9438	Inflammatory bowel disease.
9439	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.
9440	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.
9441	SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.
9442	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.
9443	He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.
9444	He has no children.
9445	He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.
9446	PHYSICAL EXAM:
9447	No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
9448	No gynecomastia
9449	Respiration comfortable
9450	No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs
9451	No skeletal deformity or tenderness
9452	Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
9453	Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
9454	No hernias.
9455	Normal penis, scrotum, and testes.
9456	Rectum: no mural lesion.
9457	Stool guaiac negative
9458	Prostate is small.
9459	The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.
9460	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.
9461	I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.
9462	Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.
9463	His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.
9464	On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.
9465	While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.
9466	We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.
9467	Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.
9468	Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

9482	Oncology COMPLETION NOTE 
9483	Patient: Oscar Meyer  #277-14-47
9484	RADIATION ONCOLOGIST: VICTOR M. ZUBIA, MD 
9485	DATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) 
9486	DIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1
9487	CONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam.
9488	An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.
9489	Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease.
9490	Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.
9491	CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.
9492	He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.
9493	SPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT.
9494	Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound.
9495	SUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone.
9496	The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day.
9497	He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34.
9498	Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy.
9499	CLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil.
9500	Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.
9501	FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.

9516	ID/CC: 64yoM with type II DM and HL p/w exertional SSCP, found to have lateral precordial/apical STDs
9517	HPI:
9518	Oscar Meyer is a 64yoM with type II DM and HL who has been having exertional, non-radiating, SSCP with activities such as shoveling snow and taking out the trash over the past several months, increasing in frequency.
9519	He endorses 6 episodes over the last week, the most recent yesterday morning when he was shoveling.
9520	The pain always resolves after 4-5 min of rest and deep breathing.
9521	He denies n/v, palps, LH, and SOB but does have diaphoresis at times.
9522	He presented to the SCH ED for evaluation today.
9523	OSH course: The patient was hypertensive (max BP 200/89); he received Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2, resulting in BP 170/90; an additional 5-mg dose resulted in BP 160/87 (later, 146/79 just prior to transfer).
9524	EKG showed small 0.5-1 mm STDs in V4-6.
9525	Initial TnI was 1.00 (CK/MB wnl).
9526	He received ASA 325, Nitropaste 1/2&#8221; (despite the fact that he takes Viagra at home), A heparin gtt was started (with bolus), and the patient was transferred to WPH in anticipation of cardiac cath.

9648	64 y.o.
9649	male with known CAD.
9650	He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
9651	At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
9652	He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
9653	He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
9654	He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA.
9655	His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
9656	He was referred for surgery.
9657	He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.
9658	He now presents with recurrent chest burning.
9659	He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG.
9660	His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest.
9661	He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis.
9662	During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test.
9663	Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds.
9664	He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved.
9665	MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility.
9666	There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct.
9667	His ejection fraction is 46%.
9668	He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.
9669	Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod.

9769	PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The 
9770	patient is a 54-year-old female seen by Dr. Paulson and also by the 
9771	Oncology service.
9772	Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a 
9773	known mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding.
9774	The patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, 
9775	and is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but 
9776	she developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the 
9777	Emergency Department today.
9778	She is otherwise healthy.
9779	Her first 
9780	time seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two 
9781	weeks ago for increased bleeding.
9782	She was diagnosed at the time 
9783	with a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a 
9784	large fibroid at that time.
9785	She now presents with increasing 
9786	weakness and light-headedness and more bleeding.
9787	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department, an IV 
9788	was started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, 
9789	electrolytes, PT/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a 
9790	urinalysis sent.
9791	A chest x-ray and EKG were sent.
9792	The patient was 
9793	made n.p.o.
9794	She is a preoperative patient.
9795	Her initial hematocrit 
9796	here was 23.
9797	A full note was written by the Oncology service, 
9798	and she is currently admitted to that service.
9799	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma.
9800	DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  As above.
9801	The 
9802	patient's condition on admission is stable.

9817	RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
9818	CDH#810 86 43 7
9819	Dear Dr. Shirley:
9820	Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.
9821	Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.
9822	Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
9823	underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
9824	hysterectomy in early October of 2078.
9825	Her post-operative course was 
9826	complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
9827	October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
9828	which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
9829	The episode was accompanied by 
9830	some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
9831	any palpitations.
9832	She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
9833	any symptomatic recurrences.
9834	Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
9835	she has been recovering well.
9836	She has no prior cardiac history.
9837	She 
9838	specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient 
9839	neurologic symptoms.
9840	She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
9841	mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.
9842	She feels that her exertional 
9843	capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
9844	stopped smoking.
9845	She does not have a known history of hypertension, however 
9846	VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
9847	systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
9848	with verapamil.
9849	There is no prior history of syncope.
9850	Page Two
9851	Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.
9852	has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.
9853	She previously smoked 
9854	two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
9855	any particular change in her health precipitating this.
9856	She rarely drinks 
9857	ethanol.
9858	She has not had any prior surgeries.
9859	Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.
9860	Review of 
9861	systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
9862	admission.
9863	Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
9864	comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.
9865	HEENT 
9866	is externally unremarkable.
9867	There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.
9868	Carotids 
9869	are palpable bilaterally.
9870	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
9871	Cardiac exam 
9872	reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
9873	impulse.
9874	There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
9875	Abdomen 
9876	is soft and nontender.
9877	There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
9878	abdomen.
9879	Extremities are without edema.
9880	Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
9881	palpable.
9882	The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
9883	of .18, QRS .08.
9884	There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
9885	and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.
9886	An 
9887	echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although 
9888	with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
9889	My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
9890	the perioperative period.
9891	She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
9892	not been previously treated.
9893	This would explain her electrocardiographic 
9894	changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
9895	atrial fibrillation.
9896	I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
9897	mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.
9898	Once her incision is further healed we will 
9899	arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
9900	regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
9901	mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.
9902	Page Three
9903	will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
9904	tolerance test.
9905	We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
9906	report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.
9907	We also gave her a 
9908	prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
9909	medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
9910	which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
9911	Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
9912	Sincerely,
9913	Paul N. Shelton, M.D.

9919	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
9920	Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.
9921	The Chief Complaint, History 
9922	of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
9923	Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
9924	by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
9925	the patient.
9926	Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
9927	with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
9928	essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.
9929	She 
9930	has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
9931	and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.
9932	Her 
9933	symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta.
9934	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
9935	noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
9936	systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
9937	border).
9938	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
9939	changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.
9940	These were 
9941	previously noted in 10/78.
9942	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
9943	and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
9944	morphine to relieve her pain.
9945	She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
9946	and was given some GI meds.
9947	She eventually became pain-free, 
9948	although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest.
9949	There are no electrocardiographic changes.
9950	IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
9951	pain suspicious for unstable angina.
9952	She has responded well to 
9953	aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
9954	evaluation.
9955	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.
9956	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission.
9957	Condition satisfactory.

10183	CLINIC NOTE 
10184	Victor Lujan
10185	SMH#:  018-92-33
10186	March 25, 2073
10187	DIAGNOSIS:
10188	Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.
10189	SUBJECTIVE:
10190	The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.
10191	The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.
10192	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
10193	Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.
10194	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
10195	Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.
10196	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
10197	Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.
10198	Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.
10199	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
10200	On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.
10201	Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.
10202	The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.
10203	There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.
10204	Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.
10205	However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.
10206	Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.
10207	IMPRESSION:
10208	As above.
10209	PLAN:
10210	My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.
10211	In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.
10212	It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

10450	   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.
10451	No left ventricular thombus is
10452	   detected.
10453	Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.
10454	Borderline left atrial enlargement.
10455	Normal right atrial size.

10637	"Studies:	"
10638	CT I -: NO SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR STUDY.
10639	NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS.
10640	CXR: Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema.
10641	The findings
10642	"	are more prominent then the prior study from 4/27/73 x-ray."
10643	EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18
10644	Impression: 
10645	55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity.
10646	His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits.
10647	The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy.
10648	He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.
10649	Recommendations: 
10650	-   check UA, NH3
10651	-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g.
10652	with Labetalol.
10653	-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.
10654	-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity
10655	-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy
10656	This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 
10657	Thank you for this interesting consult.

10856	   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham.
10857	Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.
10858	He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance.
10859	Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees.
10860	He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI.
10861	There was global hypokinesis.
10862	Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076).
10863	There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance.
10864	He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss.
10865	His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved.
10866	He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty.

11103	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a
11104	76-year-old male who presented to Orlando Regional this
11105	evening for diabetes followup.
11106	He denies any known drug

11114	on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.
11115	This
11116	evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and
11117	also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.
11118	It has not

11141	Lungs are clear to
11142	auscultation bilaterally.
11143	There are bruises noted on his
11144	right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of
11145	these were related to trauma.
11146	Examination of his feet
11147	revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,
11148	shinier than previous visits.
11149	They were cool to touch.
11150	On
11151	his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the
11152	4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
11153	other side.
11154	There was an increase in the size on the toe
11155	ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.

11190	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
11191	returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
11192	left foot ulceration.
11193	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d.
11194	and Actos 30 mg
11195	q.d.
11196	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
11197	changed, but there are no new signs of infection.
11198	He has been
11199	taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d.
11200	for the last seven days.
11201	He denies
11202	fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
11203	little bit.
11204	His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.
11205	He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.
11206	I have
11207	asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
11208	appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
11209	vascular status.
11210	I have also reviewed with him that he may need
11211	to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.
11212	Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
11213	until the end of this month.
11214	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
11215	after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.
11216	In the meantime, he will
11217	continue with all his medications.
11218	I have given him a
11219	prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d.
11220	since the pharmacy could not
11221	give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

11234	RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594
11235	Dear Dr. Vanpelt,
11236	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 
11237	recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
11238	I followed him in the hospital 
11239	when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.
11240	As you know, he is a 77 
11241	year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 
11242	hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 
11243	lower extremity bypasses in the past.
11244	He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 
11245	for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.
11246	His preoperative evaluation 
11247	included 
11248	a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 
11249	induced 
11250	hypokinesis in the inferior wall.
11251	Since this was a small area, it was felt 
11252	he 
11253	could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.
11254	He 
11255	underwent 
11256	left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 
11257	with 
11258	no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
11259	However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
11260	35 and a troponin of 19.5.
11261	As a result of his large troponin leak, he 
11262	underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 
11263	main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 
11264	artery, 
11265	100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 
11266	posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 
11267	PDA.
11268	Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 
11269	45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.
11270	Due to 
11271	his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 
11272	on 
11273	Apr 20, 2091.
11274	He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 
11275	graft to his obtuse marginal artery.
11276	He did not have a graft to his 
11277	posterior 
11278	descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary 
11279	Nicholas-Xaviar, Fred
11280	MR #65856594
11281	Page Two
11282	to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.
11283	Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 
11284	April 
11285	27, 2091.
11286	His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 
11287	Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 
11288	morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
11289	and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.
11290	Since that time, he has done quite well.
11291	He has been progressing at 
11292	rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 
11293	per 
11294	day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 
11295	his house.
11296	He denies any chest pain with walking.
11297	He has no shortness of 
11298	breath or dyspnea on exertion.
11299	He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 
11300	long 
11301	time and this is unchanged.
11302	He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 
11303	claudication symptoms with walking at this time.
11304	He does complain of some 
11305	pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation.
11306	has 
11307	plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.
11308	On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 
11309	60.
11310	His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 
11311	without carotid bruits.
11312	His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 
11313	bilaterally.
11314	His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 
11315	rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.
11316	His 
11317	chest 
11318	incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well.
11319	has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 
11320	well.
11321	There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 
11322	does not appear to be cellulitic.
11323	His feet are warm.
11324	His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 
11325	in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 
11326	unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.
11327	In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 
11328	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 
11329	disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 
11330	three 
11331	weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.
11332	will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 
11333	time.
11334	I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 
11335	and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.
11336	I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 
11337	his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.
11338	I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 
11339	regimen so I have changed his 
11340	Page Three
11341	Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d.
11342	and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o.
11343	q.d..
11344	He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 
11345	develops 
11346	any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 
11347	concerns.
11348	He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.
11349	Thank you for 
11350	allowing me to participate in his care.

12094	Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.
12095	HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago.
12096	I had treated him with:

12104	HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 
12105	When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month.
12106	He feels well.
12107	He says he's lost 10 lbs.
12108	since his last visit (262 lbs.

12132	For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.
12133	2. also poor BP control for a diabetic.
12134	Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD.
12135	It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.
12136	3.
12137	MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

12149	Dear Dr. Truong:
12150	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
12151	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
12152	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
12153	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
12154	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
12155	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
12156	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
12157	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
12158	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
12159	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
12160	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
12161	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
12162	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
12163	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
12164	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
12165	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
12166	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
12167	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
12168	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
12169	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.

12526	Dear Bethany: 
12527	I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.
12528	Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.
12529	Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.
12530	Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.
12531	She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.
12532	She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.
12533	After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.
12534	At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.
12535	When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.
12536	She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.
12537	She has not had palpitations.
12538	She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.
12539	She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits.
12540	She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.
12541	She has not had any peripheral numbness.
12542	The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.
12543	The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner.
12544	On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.
12545	The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.
12546	Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.
12547	She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.
12548	The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.
12549	She is fully alert.
12550	The neck veins are not elevated.
12551	The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.
12552	There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.
12553	The lungs are clear.
12554	The PMI is not displaced.
12555	There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.
12556	The abdomen is benign.
12557	There is no renal artery bruit.
12558	The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.
12559	There is no tenderness of her skin.
12560	The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening.
12561	Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.
12562	The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.
12563	However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.
12564	Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.
12565	I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.
12566	Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.
12567	I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.
12568	We are pleased with the present regimen.
12569	We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.
12570	We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.
12571	I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.
12572	Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.
12573	I know that you will continue to follow her closely.
12574	I told her that I would see her again in nine months.
12575	Sincerely,

12718	CXR: Clear.
12719	CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
12720	TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.
12721	A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.
12722	Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.
12723	It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.
12724	However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.
12725	Ischemic event is less likely in this man.
12726	EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.
12727	Other possible causes include:
12728	"  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently."
12729	However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.
12730	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.
12731	Plan:
12732	"1)	Continue hydration overnight."
12733	2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.
12734	3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.
12735	4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.
12736	5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.
12737	DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.
12738	Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.
12739	Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.
12740	"1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI."
12741	2)     Q6h finger stick check.
12742	3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.
12743	L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.
12744	Tender to palpation and with joint movement.
12745	No signs of infection.
12746	Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.
12747	"1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture."
12748	2)     PT consult.
12749	FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).
12750	Eating PO.
12751	On IVF for hydration.
12752	"1)	Replete Mg.  "
12753	2)     K now 3.6.
12754	If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.
12755	3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.
12756	Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin.
12757	Dispo: PT consult.
12758	Anticipate home discharge.

12769	PCP: Estep, Willa
12770	Code status: Full
12771	CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis
12772	HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.
12773	He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.
12774	He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.
12775	He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.
12776	He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.
12777	He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.
12778	When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.
12779	One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.
12780	Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.
12781	As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.
12782	According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.
12783	He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.
12784	He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.
12785	Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.
12786	At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.
12787	In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.
12788	He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.
12789	He has had no other symptoms.
12790	Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.
12791	He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.
12792	Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.
12793	"PMH: 	- DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only."
12794	HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.

12893	"	11/02/90 Head/Neck CTA    No evidence of any acute intracranial infarction."
12894	Nonspecific periventricular white matter hypodensities, which may
12895	"		represent small vessel ischemic changes."

12900	_____________________________________________________________________________________
12901	Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.
12902	Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.
12903	No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.
12904	No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.
12905	Stable Hct.
12906	Likely etiologies include:
12907	1.
12908	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.
12909	EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.
12910	Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.
12911	Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.
12912	2.
12913	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.
12914	Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.
12915	3.
12916	Prazosin-induced hypotension.
12917	In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.
12918	4.
12919	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.
12920	Plan:
12921	"Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers"
12922	"		- Telemetry"
12923	"		- 24 hr Holter monitor"
12924	"		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler"
12925	"		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m."
12926	"		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr"
12927	"		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient"
12928	"		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd"
12929	"DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m."
12930	"		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet"
12931	"OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN"
12932	"Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol"
12933	"Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc."

12947	HPI:  
12948	83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am).
12949	Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning.
12950	He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode.
12951	When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic.
12952	He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.
12953	After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded.
12954	Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea.
12955	At no point did he have chest pain.
12956	He did not lose consciousness.
12957	This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092.
12958	In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis.
12959	However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain.
12960	The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc.
12961	He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath.
12962	He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat.
12963	He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts.

12965	Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile.
12966	Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia.
12967	Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted.
12968	ROS: 
12969	Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI.

13126	ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     
13127	Chest xray: Clear
13128	Assessment & Plan
13129	83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting.
13130	Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features.
13131	However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain.
13132	Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s.
13133	However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion.
13134	It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.
13135	There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.
13136	Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
13137	Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
13138	Has completed MI r/o
13139	Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
13140	Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
13141	CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
13142	Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
13143	RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
13144	Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.
13145	Afebrile.
13146	Hemodynamically stable.
13147	U/A and chest xray negative
13148	Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
13149	Fen/Renal
13150	Replete Mg
13151	Proph: Lovenox, nexium

13286	Record date: 2078-11-22
13287	PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
13288	History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
13289	seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.
13290	On the last visit he was having 
13291	chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
13292	evaluation.
13293	At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
13294	ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.
13295	The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
13296	the past with a decreased LV function.
13297	However repeat echo within the 
13298	past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
13299	of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
13300	Humbert Hospital against medical advice.
13301	After being evaluated in the 
13302	Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
13303	the Internal Medicine clinic.
13304	Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
13305	Carafate 1 gm.
13306	PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
13307	q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d.
13308	p.r.n.
13309	and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.
13310	His 
13311	insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m.
13312	and 18 units q.p.m.
13313	and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.
13314	On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
13315	pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
13316	discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
13317	Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
13318	of 76.
13319	He is not in any acute distress.
13320	His chest is clear to 
13321	auscultation.
13322	His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
13323	sounds.
13324	His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.
13325	rectal exam is guaiac negative.
13326	His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
13327	pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.
13328	Assessment and Plan:  
13329	1.
13330	Cardiac.
13331	The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
13332	     to rule out ischemia.
13333	2.
13334	Hypertension.
13335	His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
13336	3.
13337	Diabetes.
13338	His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
13339	     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
13340	4.
13341	The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
13342	     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
13343	5.
13344	General.
13345	The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
13346	     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

13352	                                              7-21-79
13353	History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
13354	me.
13355	I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
13356	disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
13357	The patient has had a positive 
13358	exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
13359	that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.
13360	However, patient was 
13361	overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
13362	approximately 50 lb.
13363	at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
13364	catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.
13365	Patient was seen last night 
13366	in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
13367	which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
13368	flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.
13369	On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.
13370	His exam was 
13371	notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.
13372	His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
13373	well.
13374	His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
13375	did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.
13376	An 
13377	abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
13378	presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.
13379	IVP 
13380	was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.
13381	He was given Toradol 
13382	in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
13383	Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.
13384	I was called by 
13385	the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
13386	flank.
13387	On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
13388	brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.
13389	On exam 
13390	he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
13391	pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
13392	abdomen.
13393	Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
13394	peritoneal signs.
13395	Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
13396	pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
13397	musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
13398	feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
13399	undergo this study this afternoon.
13400	I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
13401	with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
13402	rule out pancreatitis.
13403	Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
13404	ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
13405	reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.
13406	He is also 
13407	status post cholecystectomy.
13408	I will review his IVP later today and make 
13409	further therapeutic interventions at that time.

13700	Dear Dr. Short:
13701	I did see Irene Upshur for a followup today.
13702	As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction.
13703	Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300.
13704	She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.
13705	When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it.
13706	On examination today, she otherwise appears well.
13707	Ears are unremarkable.
13708	Her eardrums are intact.
13709	She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.
13710	Her gait is normal.
13711	There is no nystagmus.
13712	An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.
13713	Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.
13714	Assessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.
13715	Plan:  She does take multiple medications.
13716	It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.
13717	I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.
13718	If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction, I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops.
13719	This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.
13720	However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil.
13721	I would need to clear to switch herself ??____??
13722	therapy, I would like to see her back after consistent trial of the corticosteroid spray topically.
13723	Sincerely,
13724	______________________________

13938	RE: Emery, Donn 
13939	NMH#: 059-57-26 
13940	Dear Dr. Pacheco:  
13941	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently.
13942	Thank you for your kind referral.
13943	I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.
13944	Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.
13945	His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.
13946	This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.
13947	Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left.
13948	At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.
13949	Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.
13950	He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet.
13951	He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.
13952	He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems.
13953	He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.
13954	Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.
13955	Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins.
13956	He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.
13957	He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50.
13958	His glucose control by his history has been very good.
13959	He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.
13960	Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.
13961	He has no known drug allergies.
13962	He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.
13963	His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.
13964	He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.
13965	He has several children, all in good health.
13966	On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.
13967	No carotid bruits could be appreciated.
13968	The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.
13969	He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.
13970	Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.
13971	Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.
13972	The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.
13973	Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.
13974	On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.
13975	There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.
13976	Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.
13977	In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.
13978	Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.
13979	Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.
13980	There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.
13981	Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.
13982	Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.
13983	Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.
13984	There was no jaw jerk.
13985	Toes were downgoing bilaterally.
13986	Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.
13987	Those results were available for me today.
13988	They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.
13989	Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.
13990	There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.
13991	Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.
13992	With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration.
13993	There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual.
13994	In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon.
13995	The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence.
13996	I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.
13997	Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.
13998	We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.
13999	However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him.
14000	Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem.
14001	I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.
14002	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.
14003	Once again, thank you for your kind referral.
14004	Sincerely,

14012	NMH#:  059-57-26
14013	December 29, 2096
14014	INTERVAL HISTORY:
14015	He has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis.
14016	He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. 
14017	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
14018	General:  Complaint of mild fatigue.
14019	No fevers, chills, or change in appetite.
14020	HEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness.
14021	Pulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing.
14022	Cardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations.
14023	Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.
14024	Urologic:  No dysuria, hematuria.
14025	Lymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
14026	Musculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain.
14027	Hematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting.
14028	Neurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right.
14029	He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.
14030	He has had some moderately severe back pain.
14031	REVIEW OF STUDIES:
14032	Blood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3.
14033	I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing.
14034	A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months.
14035	If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age.
14036	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
14037	Weight:  175 lb.
14038	with shoes.
14039	Blood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine.
14040	He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.
14041	Skin:  Normal.
14042	Lymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
14043	There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.
14044	Lungs:  Clear.
14045	Heart:  Normal.
14046	Abdomen:  No masses or tenderness.
14047	Extremities:  No evidence of DVT.
14048	No edema.
14049	Rectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities.
14050	IMPRESSION:  
14051	He is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone.
14052	His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall.
14053	I will see him next in six months.

14159	"Impressions and Plan:	"
14160	"  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes."
14161	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.
14162	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89.
14163	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him.
14164	Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect).
14165	Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper.
14166	I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice.
14167	Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind.
14168	Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.
14169	Thanks.
14170	Will follow.

14350	"	Interval History:"
14351	   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.
14352	The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.
14353	He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.
14354	The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
14355	Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.
14356	The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.
14357	Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).
14358	The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
14359	An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.
14360	The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.
14361	Past medical history:

14536	Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.
14537	Assessment and plan:
14538	   ASSESSMENT:
14539	63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).
14540	In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.
14541	The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.
14542	PLAN:
14543	Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).
14544	Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.
14545	No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.
14546	Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.
14547	Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.
14548	Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.
14549	Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.
14550	Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.
14551	Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.
14552	Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.
14553	Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.
14554	Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.
14555	Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

14881	RE:  Lara, Uriah
14882	MRN: 62115644
14883	Dear Dr. Eastman:
14884	Thank you very much for referring Uriah Lara to the Georgia Regional.
14885	He's a 51 year old male who approximately 2 weeks ago developed 
14886	a pain and stiffness in his neck that limits his range of motion.
14887	Approximately 5 days ago he developed acute, severe and boring pain at 
14888	the right trapezius and medial scapular that limits his ability to sleep 
14889	and function.
14890	Toradol, anti-inflammatory muscle relaxants and Percocet 
14891	were of minimal help.
14892	He had no other constitutional symptoms; fevers, 
14893	rashes.
14894	He had noticed some numbness and tingling down the right 5th 
14895	finger and the pain would often travel down the outer part of the 
14896	triceps region to the elbow and down to the right 5th finger.
14897	He notes 
14898	certain positions will alleviate the pain.
14899	He then presented to a 
14900	chiropractor on Saturday who manipulated his back, obtained x-rays which 
14901	showed no abnormality.
14902	Sunday, he received another manipulation and on 
14903	Sunday night he was abdominal to sleep through the night.
14904	This morning 
14905	he states he had no pain in his neck, however, in mid-morning he did 
14906	have recurrent pain.
14907	He presents today for management treatment of his 
14908	disorder.
14909	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
14910	MEDICATIONS:  Flurazepam 20mg.
14911	at night.
14912	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for repair of a right 
14913	femoral compound fracture approximately 2 years ago and breast reduction 
14914	surgery.
14915	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary embolism after his 
14916	orthopedic surgery.
14917	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a pilot for Frontier Airlines.
14918	He is married and has 3 children who are healthy.
14919	He 
14920	smokes a pipe.
14921	FAMILY HISTORY:  He has one sister who has had a radiculopathy.
14922	Mother 
14923	is alive and well at 86.
14924	Father died of an MI.
14925	Page 2
14926	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure is 140/90.
14927	HEENT 
14928	examination was otherwise normal.
14929	Posture is somewhat stooped.
14930	Examination of the joints reveal deformity and swelling of the right 3rd 
14931	PIP.
14932	Has normal DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows and shoulders.
14933	Normal 
14934	hips, knees, ankles and toes.
14935	In the effected arm, he has normal elbow, 
14936	normal triceps and biceps reflexes.
14937	Normal brachioradialis reflexes.
14938	He has normal sensation in his hand.
14939	He has weakness of the right hand 
14940	intrinsic muscles and palpation in the medial muscle has felt an 
14941	improvement in the pain.
14942	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Lara, I believe, has an acute radiculopathy of the 
14943	a-cervical nerve.
14944	I informed him that this will get better and that it 
14945	was probably brought on by his antecedent muscle spasm.
14946	PLAN:  We prescribed a neck collar, Indocin 50 TID, Flexeril 10 TID and 
14947	I gave him additional Percocet.
14948	I also prescribed a course of physical 
14949	therapy with ultrasound and massage.
14950	He will call me in one week and return in roughly 2 weeks.
14951	Sincerely yours,

15163	He
15164	underwent CT scanning of the chest, which ruled out aortic
15165	dissection after discussion with the attending radiologist.
15166	As
15167	his blood pressure stabilized, he received IV Lopressor and
15168	became pain free.
15169	He did not require any further nitroglycerin.
15170	Repeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the 0.5 mm ST
15171	depression in the anterior leads.
15172	Given the patient's cardiac
15173	risk factor and his history, which is fairly worrisome for

15236	Dear Kenneth: 
15237	Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention.
15238	He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.
15239	At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.
15240	He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.
15241	He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.
15242	MEDICATIONS:
15243	1.
15244	Aspirin 325 mg daily.
15245	2.
15246	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
15247	3.
15248	Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
15249	4.
15250	Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
15251	5.
15252	Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
15253	6.
15254	Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.
15255	INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:
15256	Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.
15257	Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.
15258	On examination, he is comfortable at rest.
15259	The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.
15260	The jugular venous pressure is 5.
15261	The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.
15262	The chest is clear.
15263	Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.
15264	The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.
15265	There is no peripheral pitting edema.
15266	The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.
15267	In summary, Mr. Lara has:
15268	History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.
15269	Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.
15270	Hypertension, not controlled.
15271	His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.
15272	We spoke about the options.
15273	As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.
15274	He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.
15275	To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.
15276	"A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly."
15277	Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.
15278	[Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms.
15279	Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines.
15280	He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.
15281	He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]
15282	Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.
15283	When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.
15284	A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.
15285	Mild mitral regurgitation.
15286	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.
15287	With kind regards, sincerely yours,

15541	RE: HEATH, QUINTEN M
15542	      MRN: 8059475
15543	      DOB: 08/02/2095
15544	Dear Dr. Calhoun;
15545	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
15546	As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck.
15547	We.
15548	started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
15549	In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
15550	We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
15551	He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.
15552	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
15553	1.
15554	Osteoporosis.
15555	2.
15556	Hypogonadism.
15557	3.
15558	History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
15559	4.
15560	Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
15561	5.
15562	Hypertension.
15563	6.
15564	Diabetes type 2.
15565	7.
15566	Carotid artery disease, left.
15567	8.
15568	Hypercholesterolemia.
15569	9.
15570	Status post AAA repair in 2165.
15571	10.
15572	Coronary artery disease with status post stent.
15573	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.
15574	MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day.
15575	ALLERGIES: Tape.
15576	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.
15577	Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds.
15578	Height 5 feet 4 inches.
15579	LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171.
15580	His hematocrit is 39.
15581	It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000.
15582	White count 4.8.
15583	In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer.
15584	The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
15585	I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
15586	He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.
15587	We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
15588	Please let me know if you have any questions.
15589	Yours sincerely,

15602	RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE
15603	HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75
15604	REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.
15605	DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173
15606	REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).
15607	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.
15608	He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.
15609	This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.
15610	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.
15611	He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.
15612	While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.
15613	He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.
15614	In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.
15615	On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
15616	On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.
15617	On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.
15618	Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.
15619	On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.
15620	He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69.
15621	Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).
15622	INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
15623	He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
15624	He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
15625	He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat.
15626	Otherwise, he has been doing well.
15627	He denies significant respiratory symptoms.
15628	No focal or generalized neurological symptoms.

15828	PATIENT:  XAYAVONG, BRANDON
15829	MRN:  7826250
15830	ADMIT DATE: 6/13/2082
15831	PCP: DR. ERNEST EDGE
15832	ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON
15833	OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)
15834	CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness
15835	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
15836	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
15837	He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).
15838	Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.
15839	He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).
15840	He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.
15841	He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.
15842	He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.
15843	To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.
15844	However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.
15845	On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.
15846	Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.
15847	EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).
15848	He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.
15849	For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.
15850	Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.
15851	(He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)
15852	CXR by report was clear.
15853	With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.
15854	Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.
15855	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
15856	Negative in detail except as noted otherwise above.
15857	PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: 
15858	CAD, h/o STEMI 2077, 8 stents including LAD at least x2, BiV/ICD placement 2 weeks ago, last cath Duluth 2 weeks with &#8220;multivessel disease not amenable to CABG&#8221;

15946	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
15947	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
15948	He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.
15949	He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.
15950	# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms
15951	- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion
15952	- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol
15953	- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs
15954	- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)
15955	- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures
15956	- Tele, replete lytes
15957	# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist
15958	- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids
15959	- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers
15960	- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 
15961	# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home.
15962	Relatively euvolemic.
15963	- Continue lasix QOD regimen
15964	- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy
15965	- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service
15966	# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house.

16065	He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.
16066	He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.
16067	Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.
16068	He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.
16069	He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.
16070	At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.
16071	He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.
16072	He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.
16073	He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.
16074	He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.
16075	Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.
16076	He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.
16077	He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.
16078	He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.
16079	He denies recent fevers or chills.
16080	He has no complaint of leg swelling.

16097	Cardiac Catheterization (10/30/77)
16098	Dominance: Right
16099	Left Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, intermediate
16100	sized vessel.
16101	It bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary arteries.
16102	Left main coronary artery is normal.
16103	LAD: The Proximal LAD has a diffuse, irregular, and thrombotic 90 % stenosis in its proximal third.

16106	Both the D1 and Ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic proximal LAD segment.
16107	Left Circumflex: The left circumflex coronary artery is moderate sized vessel, which gives origin to two obtuse marginal arteries.
16108	The artery contains only minimal irregularities.
16109	RCA: The right coronary artery is a large vessel.
16110	The artery contains only
16111	minimal irregularities.

16433	Head CT/CTA Head and Neck (Today): 
16434	No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, masses or large territorial infarction.
16435	Left M1 segment filling defect likely represent a thrombus which is partially occlusive given the opacification of the distal MCA 
16436	branches.
16437	This finding correlates with patient's given symptoms.
16438	EKG (Today): 
16439	CXR (Today): Large heart
16440	Assessment
16441	: 
16442	There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.
16443	Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.
16444	He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE.
16445	He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.
16446	NIHSS was zero.
16447	CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.
16448	There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.
16449	The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.
16450	He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.
16451	Plan: 
16452	- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
16453	- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
16454	- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
16455	- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
16456	- Neuro checks q4 hours
16457	- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
16458	- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
16459	- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
16460	- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
16461	- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
16462	- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.
16463	- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
16464	- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
16465	- Check blood cultures
16466	- Check chromogenic Factor X level
16467	- PT/OT evaluation
16468	- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130

16483	"	ECI 280-44-07-1"
16484	Dear Dr. Ponce:
16485	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.
16486	He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.
16487	Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.
16488	The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.
16489	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.
16490	His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.
16491	Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.
16492	He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.
16493	He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.
16494	He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.
16495	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
16496	Please call if you have questions.

16509	Dear Dr. Berg:
16510	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.
16511	As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.
16512	He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
16513	He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.
16514	He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.
16515	He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
16516	The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
16517	The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.
16518	Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.
16519	He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
16520	He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
16521	His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.
16522	He is in atrial fibrillation.
16523	His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.
16524	His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
16525	His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.
16526	There is no hematoma or bruit.
16527	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
16528	His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.
16529	His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.
16530	His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.
16531	His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.
16532	We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o.
16533	daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
16534	daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.
16535	He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.
16536	He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
16537	daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.
16538	daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o.
16539	b.i.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o.

16568	Dear Dr. Dill:
16569	DOB:  10/11/2082
16570	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
16571	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
16572	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
16573	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
16574	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
16575	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
16576	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
16577	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
16578	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
16579	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
16580	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
16581	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
16582	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
16583	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
16584	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
16585	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
16586	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
16587	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
16588	His weight has been stable.
16589	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
16590	His weight has remained stable.
16591	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
16592	Past Medical History:
16593	1.
16594	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
16595	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
16596	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
16597	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
16598	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
16599	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
16600	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
16601	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
16602	2.
16603	Hypertension.
16604	3.
16605	Dyslipidemia.
16606	4.
16607	Diabetes.
16608	5.
16609	Obstructive sleep apnea.
16610	6.
16611	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
16612	7.
16613	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
16614	8.?
16615	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
16616	9.
16617	Atrial fibrillation.
16618	10.
16619	Obesity.
16620	He has no known drug allergies.
16621	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
16622	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
16623	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
16624	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
16625	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
16626	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
16627	His father lived until the age of 88.
16628	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
16629	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
16630	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
16631	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
16632	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
16633	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
16634	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
16635	There is no wheezing.
16636	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
16637	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
16638	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
16639	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
16640	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
16641	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
16642	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
16643	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
16644	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
16645	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
16646	He appears to be functional class III.
16647	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
16648	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
16649	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
16650	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
16651	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
16652	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
16653	We will leave this decision to them.
16654	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
16655	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
16656	We will be in touch following the procedure.
16657	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
16658	Sincerely,

16672	"Reason for Visit	"
16673	Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.
16674	"Problems	  "
16675	"Congestive heart failure	      "
16676	He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.
16677	He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.
16678	He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.
16679	Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.
16680	Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.
16681	Moderate LV margin.
16682	Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).
16683	Dilated aortic loop.
16684	Normal RV size and function.
16685	Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.
16686	He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.
16687	He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
16688	"coronary artery disease	      "
16689	After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.
16690	Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.
16691	10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.
16692	Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.
16693	The L main had no significant lesions.
16694	The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.
16695	He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.
16696	He was discharged the following day without complications.
16697	Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.
16698	"pacemaker	      "
16699	S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.
16700	Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.
16701	"S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      "
16702	12/76.
16703	10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT.
16704	CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD.
16705	AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST.
16706	FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT.
16707	TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.
16708	[04-Nov-2078]
16709	He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  
16710	"hypertension	      "
16711	BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.
16712	If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol
16713	"diabetes mellitus	      "
16714	He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
16715	He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.
16716	Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.
16717	"hypercholesterolemia	      "
16718	He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.
16719	We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.
16720	"nephropathy	      "
16721	S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
16722	As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.
16723	He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.
16724	[02-Jun-2087]
16725	Recheck BUN and creatinine today.
16726	"peripheral vascular disease	      "
16727	He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.
16728	"RECTAL FISTULA	      "
16729	SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE.
16730	SIG.
16731	HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA.
16732	HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.
16733	PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.
16734	CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.
16735	"OSTEOARTHRITIS	      "
16736	He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.
16737	"It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs."
16738	Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.
16739	Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.
16740	"Carotid stenosis	      "
16741	According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.
16742	Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.
16743	He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.
16744	"Review of Systems	"
16745	Small lesion on his R ear.
16746	Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.

16832	    exams with Dr. Ortiz.
16833	Influenza vaccine advised, Winter 89.
16834	PSA sent.
16835	2.

16845	PROBLEMS:
16846	CAD.
16847	He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
16848	    current symptoms of angina.
16849	He is s/p CABG and most
16850	    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.
16851	CHF.
16852	He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic
16853	    CHF.
16854	His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe
16855	    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with
16856	    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate
16857	    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial
16858	    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. 
16859	    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and
16860	    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for
16861	    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms
16862	    of orthopnea, PND or edema.
16863	3.
16864	S/P AICD.
16865	He is s/p recent admission to MCH, 6/17 through
16866	    6/19/89 for replacement of his cardiac defibrillator.

16868	    did well without complication and he continues to follow up
16869	    Dr. Cook on a regular basis.
16870	He has had no VT, VF, which
16871	    has been symptomatic or which has caused triggering of his
16872	    AICD.
16873	4.

16881	MR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089
16882	    6.
16883	Diabetes mellitus.
16884	He continues on oral agents, watching
16885	    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.
16886	He does not
16887	    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
16888	    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
16889	    of hypoglycemia.
16890	Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
16891	    albumin today.
16892	7.
16893	Cerebral vascular disease.
16894	He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
16895	    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
16896	    has had no new neurologic events.
16897	His most recent carotid
16898	    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
16899	    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
16900	    today.
16901	He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.
16902	8.
16903	Hypercholesterolemia.
16904	His most recent lipid profile is
16905	    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
16906	    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
16907	Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
16908	    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past.
16909	9.
16910	Peripheral vascular disease.
16911	He continues to have bilateral
16912	    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
16913	    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
16914	    of claudication.
16915	10.
16916	Osteoarthritis.
16917	He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
16918	    and is now doing quite well.
16919	Notably, he would require
16920	    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.
16921	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
16922	abdominal pain.
16923	He continues to have a rectal fistula.
16924	Last
16925	year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
16926	sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
16927	presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
16928	bleeds.
16929	He has had no recent edema in his legs.
16930	His left knee is
16931	doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
16932	muscles.
16933	He has nocturia one time per night.
16934	He has stable
16935	impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased
16936	ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial
16937	erection.
16938	Generalized decreased energy level.
16939	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular.

17021	He had an episode of shortness of breath leading
17022	to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.
17023	Unfortunately, I
17024	do not have records but there was some question of whether this
17025	was related to asthma, allergies or CHF.

17082	and pain.
17083	He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
17084	Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
17085	and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.
17086	He is

17143	George, Rickey
17144	MRN: 1131414
17145	06/10/92
17146	REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.
17147	PROBLEMS:
17148	1.
17149	Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.
17150	Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.
17151	He was managed by multiple
17152	services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.
17153	His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
17154	with a prolonged course of fluconazole.
17155	Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
17156	effectively with carvedilol.
17157	Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
17158	hospitalization.
17159	He never had any sustained VT or VF.
17160	He was subsequently discharged home
17161	with a Life vest defibrillator.
17162	He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.
17163	He currently has no AICD or
17164	pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
17165	for his arrhythmia issues.
17166	He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.
17167	Currently
17168	his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
17169	regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.
17170	2.
17171	CHF.
17172	Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
17173	directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him.
17174	He had one episode of CHF, which
17175	was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.
17176	At the
17177	present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
17178	night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
17179	He does
17180	continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
17181	3.
17182	Coronary artery disease.
17183	Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
17184	angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
17185	4.
17186	Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.
17187	His left TKR also required removal
17188	due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.
17189	He has had no
17190	recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
17191	issues.
17192	He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
17193	down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.
17194	5.
17195	Diabetes mellitus.
17196	Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
17197	twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
17198	has been gradually decreased.
17199	He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
17200	and he reports that his fasting
17201	sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
17202	range.
17203	He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.
17204	We will check
17205	his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
17206	Page 2
17207	6.
17208	Hyperlipidemia.
17209	He continues on Lipitor.
17210	We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
17211	CPK.
17212	7.
17213	Diabetic nephropathy.
17214	He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
17215	to re-establish baseline.
17216	8.
17217	Status post CVA.
17218	Known moderate right carotid stenosis.
17219	Minimal residual dysarthria
17220	and right-sided weakness.
17221	Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.
17222	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.
17223	Was unable to get sufficient blood
17224	pressure by cuff.
17225	Pulse 60, mostly irregular.
17226	General, thin, but no distress.
17227	Lungs, clear to
17228	auscultation and percussion.
17229	Cor, distant heart sounds.
17230	No S3 appreciated.
17231	Old pacer/AICD site.
17232	No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.
17233	Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.
17234	DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.
17235	ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
17236	both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
17237	At this time, he was
17238	quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
17239	He did deny
17240	abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
17241	At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
17242	send in to me by mail.
17243	I have also sent off a CBC today.
17244	I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
17245	next visit.
17246	If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
17247	more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
17248	aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

17259	                      OFFICE NOTE
17260	  Rickey George
17261	  MR#1131414
17262	  October 05, 2092
17263	  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.
17264	PROBLEMS:
17265	  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe.
17266	Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.
17267	Treated by Dr. Randall.
17268	Underwent extensive
17269	  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
17270	  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
17271	  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
17272	  knee popliteal bypass graft.
17273	With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
17274	  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
17275	He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
17276	  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
17277	  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.
17278	Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
17279	  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
17280	  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
17281	  hospital discharge 9/9.
17282	Will recheck renal function today.
17283	Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
17284	  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.
17285	His blood sugars are now in the normal
17286	  range on no oral agents or insulin.
17287	Will need to monitor closely through rehab.
17288	CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d.
17289	of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.
17290	At the time of
17291	  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d.
17292	and not surprisingly he developed quite
17293	  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.
17294	He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
17295	  up to 60 b.i.d.
17296	but he still has significant edema.
17297	Will go back to 80 b.i.d.
17298	with close
17299	  monitoring.
17300	Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.
17301	Will hold lisinopril
17302	  for now.
17303	Close VNA follow up.
17304	COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.
17305	Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.
17306	Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
17307	  and surgery with blood loss.
17308	His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
17309	  and he was being started on Epogen.
17310	Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
17311	  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a
17312	  Page 2
17313	  week.
17314	For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.
17315	Given his
17316	  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.
17317	Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
17318	  anginal symptoms.
17319	Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.
17320	Generally weak.
17321	Home services
17322	  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
17323	  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.
17324	Social history: wife very involved with his care.
17325	Physical exam: BP 98/60.
17326	Pulse 64.
17327	Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop.
17328	No rub.
17329	Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.
17330	Multiple well healed surgical scars.
17331	Extremities: incisions in the groin.
17332	No erythema.
17333	Right groin several cm question cystic
17334	  structure beneath the incision.
17335	Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.
17336	2-3+ edema in the
17337	  extremities bilaterally.
17338	Dry gangrene left second toe.
17339	Disposition: 1.
17340	Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d.
17341	phone follow up within several days.
17342	2.
17343	Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.
17344	3.
17345	Continue Percocet for toe pain.
17346	4.
17347	Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.
17348	5.
17349	Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.
17350	In the meantime, will
17351	  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.
17352	6.
17353	Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o.
17354	q.d.
17355	Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
17356	  about end of life issues.
17357	Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
17358	  other than his single toe at this point.
17359	"He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a"
17360	  BKA.
17361	He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
17362	  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

17502	"	Interval History:"
17503	   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
17504	Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
17505	Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
17506	Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
17507	The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
17508	A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
17509	There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
17510	A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
17511	Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
17512	RV function was normal.
17513	He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
17514	He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
17515	He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted.
17516	He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
17517	The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
17518	LV EF 63%.
17519	He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
17520	His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.
17521	A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
17522	The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
17523	LV EF 68%.
17524	He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
17525	He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
17526	He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.
17527	He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
17528	His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
17529	Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
17530	This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
17531	Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
17532	He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e.
17533	muscolskeletal in nature).
17534	He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
17535	He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
17536	He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
17537	No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
17538	He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
17539	He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
17540	He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
17541	Past medical history:
17542	   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
17543	Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
17544	2) Hypertension
17545	3) Hyperlipideimia
17546	4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI

17569	   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.
17570	Assessment and plan:
17571	   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
17572	1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.
17573	Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
17574	Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
17575	He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
17576	His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
17577	The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
17578	He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
17579	His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
17580	However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
17581	I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
17582	2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.
17583	His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
17584	Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.
17585	He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
17586	flushing).
17587	He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
17588	After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.
17589	He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
17590	He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
17591	3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
17592	He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

17611	"	Interval History:"
17612	   Primary cardiologist: Jan Ivory (Kevin Mcdaniel)
17613	61 y/o M with h/o CAD admitted for CP.
17614	Cardiovascular history notable for:
17615	- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
17616	- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
17617	- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%
17618	He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.
17619	He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.
17620	He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.
17621	Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.
17622	No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.
17623	Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.
17624	Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.
17625	After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.
17626	Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.
17627	At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.
17628	Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.
17629	Past medical history:
17630	   - CAD - as above
17631	- HTN
17632	- hyperlipidemia
17633	- DM2 - no known microvascular disease; last A1c 7.3 (June 36)
17634	- Ankylosing spondylitis
17635	- h/o thrombophlebitis (vs DVT) of left leg
17636	- hemorrhoids s/p banding

17692	Chandler, Jessica
17693	MRN #748-80-38-0
17694	May 05, 2069
17695	Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
17696	artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
17697	Since the surgery she has done
17698	quite well.
17699	She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
17700	4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
17701	and also education on dietary modification.
17702	During her hospital
17703	course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
17704	ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
17705	wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
17706	She was
17707	started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
17708	She
17709	also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
17710	Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
17711	She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
17712	renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
17713	Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
17714	diuretics.
17715	Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
17716	with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
17717	She is
17718	not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
17719	of breath.
17720	She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
17721	Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
17722	Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
17723	Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
17724	q.d.,
17725	lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o.
17726	daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o.
17727	Kayexalate 15 p.o.
17728	q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
17729	q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o.
17730	q. day, Nephrocaps
17731	one tablet p.o.
17732	q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
17733	subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o.
17734	q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o.
17735	q. day and
17736	CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
17737	Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
17738	pounds.
17739	Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
17740	150/100, pulse is 80.
17741	Her skin is without any rashes or
17742	ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.
17743	Heart regular rhythm,
17744	distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
17745	Her lungs are clear,
17746	there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
17747	healed.
17748	Her extremities are without any edema.
17749	Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
17750	Diagnosis:
17751	1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
17752	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
17753	Page 2 
17754	3)   Diabetes mellitus.
17755	4)   Anemia of chronic disease.
17756	5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.
17757	6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
17758	7)   Hypertension.
17759	8)   Morbid obesity.
17760	Plan:
17761	1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
17762	She is clinically
17763	     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
17764	     or angina.
17765	Her ejection fraction significantly improved
17766	     postoperatively.
17767	I am concerned about a relatively high blood
17768	     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
17769	     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
17770	I will
17771	     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
17772	     of her potassium.
17773	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
17774	Again we'll check regular labs
17775	     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
17776	Stable.
17777	Her blood pressure have been
17778	     under fairly good control.
17779	She has also lost a significant
17780	     amount of weight over 20 pounds.
17781	Her current weight is 326
17782	     pounds.
17783	We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
17784	We'll also recheck her blood count
17785	     and follow-up.
17786	The patient is using her CPAP
17787	     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
17788	6)   Hyperkalemia.
17789	She will continue with the Kayexalate as
17790	     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
17791	     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
17792	7)   Morbid obesity.
17793	She is making good progress with her weight
17794	     loss.
17795	She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
17796	     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
17797	     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
17798	     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica
17799	Page 3 
17800	She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

17815	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
17816	evaluated by Dr. Wooten.
17817	Please see Dr. Wooten's note.
17818	The 
17819	patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
17820	days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
17821	sputum.
17822	She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting.
17823	Minimal diaphoresis.
17824	She has had a fever.
17825	No urinary symptoms.
17826	She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes.
17827	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
17828	bypass grafting.
17829	MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
17830	albuterol and Nephrocaps.
17831	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
17832	SOCIAL HISTORY:  A non-smoker.
17833	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An obese female, mild acute distress.
17834	Temperature 101 degrees.
17835	Heart has a regular rate and rhythm.
17836	Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales.
17837	abdomen is obese, soft.
17838	Neurologic exam is non-focal.
17839	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory 
17840	effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.
17841	EKG 
17842	is unchanged.
17843	Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time.
17844	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated.
17845	Chest x-ray was obtained.
17846	The patient has an IV established but 
17847	were unable to draw labs.
17848	Under my direct supervision and with 
17849	some attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the 
17850	infraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein 
17851	without success.
17852	The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and 
17853	the neck anatomy is difficult to assess.
17854	We are unable to 
17855	establish a line.
17856	She has a chest x-ray for rule out of 
17857	pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for 
17858	blood draws.
17859	IMPRESSION:  Hypoxia, possible pneumonia and a facial abscess.
17860	PLAN:  Admission.
17861	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition on

17878	07/28/70
17879	Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
17880	shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.
17881	I had added
17882	Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.
17883	However,
17884	her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
17885	increase in her BUN and creatinine.
17886	Her BUN is in the 80's, and
17887	her creatinine is about 3.4.
17888	She states her breathing has been
17889	excellent, however.
17890	She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
17891	exertion.
17892	She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
17893	having any kind of dry cough.
17894	Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
17895	q.day, Paxil 20 p.o.
17896	q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o.
17897	q.day, Prilosec 20 mg

17902	Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o.
17903	q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
17904	in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
17905	q.day.
17906	Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
17907	Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
17908	acute distress.
17909	Her weight is 330 pounds.
17910	This is down over 20
17911	pounds over the past month.
17912	Her blood pressure is 122/80.
17913	Her
17914	pulse is 80.
17915	Her lungs are clear.
17916	Her heart reveals distant heart
17917	sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.
17918	Her extremities are notable
17919	for the absence of lower extremity edema.
17920	Her abdomen is also
17921	noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
17922	past.
17923	Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
17924	continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
17925	the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.
17926	There is beefy red
17927	granulation tissue surrounding this.

17946	Plan:
17947	She is doing much better on
17948	higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
17949	since her last visit here about a month ago.
17950	At this point in
17951	time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
17952	given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
17953	to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
17954	and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
17955	and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
17956	telephone conversation in four days.
17957	Should she have an increase
17958	in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
17959	Stable
17960	without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.
17961	Continue current
17962	medication.
17963	She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.
17964	I strongly wanted her to go
17965	on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
17966	her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.
17967	She is
17968	planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.
17969	I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
17970	strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.
17971	Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.
17972	Stable.
17973	regimen.
17974	The plan as above is to
17975	stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days.
17976	Diabetic foot ulcer.
17977	I also gave her a duoderm dressing
17978	to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
17979	podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
17980	appropriate treatment.

18060	He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.
18061	On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.
18062	As a result he did not exercise that day.
18063	The symptoms improved spontaneously.
18064	On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.
18065	Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.
18066	Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.
18067	He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.
18068	There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.
18069	He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.
18070	"When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion."
18071	He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.
18072	He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.
18073	Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.
18074	He is feeling great.
18075	He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.

18236	HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
18237	treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.
18238	He was seen in MHC 
18239	clinic prior to that.
18240	His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
18241	number is 872-9985.
18242	Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
18243	that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
18244	not seen a physician in the past year.
18245	His medical problems include:
18246	1.
18247	Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.
18248	It is unclear 
18249	     which vessels were plastied.
18250	2.
18251	Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
18252	     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.
18253	However, he has not taken any 
18254	     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well.
18255	3.
18256	Anxiety.
18257	4.
18258	Condyloma last fall.
18259	Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.
18260	; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
18261	q.h.s.
18262	prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.
18263	Patient also had 
18264	nitroglycerin tablets at home.
18265	Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
18266	t.i.d.
18267	; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.
18268	He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
18269	Social history:  He is currently not working.
18270	He has been unemployed for 
18271	a month and a half.
18272	He used to be a social worker which did not 
18273	involve any heavy lifting.
18274	He did community services managment.
18275	He 
18276	lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.
18277	Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
18278	chest pains over the last 10 years.
18279	However, he does say that his last 
18280	chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.
18281	When asked where the 
18282	pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
18283	pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
18284	angioplasty.
18285	He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
18286	relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.
18287	At the 
18288	time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.
18289	He has no 
18290	history of exertional angina over the last several years.
18291	However, this 
18292	complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.
18293	currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
18294	exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
18295	On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
18296	apparent distress.
18297	Temperature was afebrile.
18298	Heart rate was 68 and 
18299	regular.
18300	Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
18301	position.
18302	HEENT was within normal limits.
18303	Lungs were clear bilaterally.
18304	Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
18305	Abdomen was benign.
18306	Extremities were without edema or lesions.

18308	Page 2                                        55931516
18309	Assessment and Plan:
18310	Cardiovascular.
18311	Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
18312	     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
18313	     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.
18314	Given that he is on 
18315	     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
18316	     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d.
18317	in an attempt to 
18318	     control his blood pressure and heart rate.
18319	I also encouraged him to 
18320	     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
18321	     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.
18322	The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
18323	     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.
18324	After he 
18325	     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
18326	     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
18327	     evidence of ischemia at this time.
18328	If he does, we will recommend a 
18329	     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
18330	     causing syms of rest angina.
18331	The case was discussed with any 
18332	     cardiacs that are on call.
18333	Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
18334	     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
18335	     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
18336	     has at a level of 336.
18337	He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
18338	     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.
18339	I 
18340	     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
18341	     diet and explained which food contain those products.
18342	I will also 
18343	     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
18344	     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.
18345	We will start him 
18346	     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d.
18347	later this week.
18348	Daily anxiety.
18349	Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
18350	     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
18351	     Ativan.
18352	History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.
18353	Patient 
18354	     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
18355	     his next visit.
18356	If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
18357	     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

18360	Patient is now applying for free care at Mamaroneck Health Center 
18361	     status post losing his job and LBH insurance last year.
18362	The 
18363	     patient's home phone number is 534-3442.

18721	RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
18722	SFC#:  553-15-48 
18723	Dear Dr. Kirk:  
18724	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.
18725	He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.
18726	The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
18727	An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
18728	The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.
18729	The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.
18730	Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
18731	There was no critical carotid stenosis.
18732	He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.
18733	He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
18734	His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.
18735	It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.
18736	He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
18737	He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.
18738	Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.
18739	He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
18740	He has no symptoms of aphasia.
18741	He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.
18742	I would agree with him.
18743	He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.
18744	Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.
18745	He has not had any problems with spasms.
18746	His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
18747	He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.
18748	He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.
18749	His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
18750	He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
18751	He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
18752	He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
18753	His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.
18754	b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o.
18755	q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o.
18756	q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o.
18757	q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o.
18758	b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.
18759	He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.
18760	He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
18761	I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.
18762	He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
18763	The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
18764	The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
18765	There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.
18766	On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
18767	His blood pressure was 150/90.
18768	His language was intact.
18769	His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.
18770	He was alert and oriented.
18771	His conversation was appropriate.
18772	The visual fields were full.
18773	The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.
18774	Facial sensation was normal.
18775	There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
18776	The tongue and palate were midline.
18777	The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
18778	There was atrophy of the left biceps.
18779	There was full range of motion of the joints.
18780	The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.
18781	The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
18782	His right side was 5/5.
18783	He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
18784	His right toe was downgoing.
18785	Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
18786	I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
18787	Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
18788	He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.
18789	Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.
18790	He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
18791	I hope that this will be the case.
18792	Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.
18793	I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
18794	His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
18795	I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.
18796	I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
18797	The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
18798	I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
18799	However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.
18800	He should continue on an aspirin a day.
18801	He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
18802	I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.
18803	We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
18804	This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
18805	After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.
18806	I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
18807	I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.
18808	The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.
18809	Sincerely,

19487	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
19488	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
19489	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
19490	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
19491	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
19492	-Telemetry
19493	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
19494	-If positive will start heparin gtt
19495	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
19496	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
19497	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix
19498	-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)
19499	#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs.
19500	The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease.
19501	Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP.
19502	Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct.
19503	-f/u smear
19504	-monitor CBC
19505	#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival
19506	-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)
19507	#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose
19508	-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123
19509	-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM
19510	#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7
19511	-FSBG AC+HS
19512	-RISS AC
19513	#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.
19514	-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70
19515	-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine
19516	-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection
19517	#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response
19518	-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)
19519	#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs
19520	-Urine tox
19521	-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings
19522	-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation
19523	-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624
19524	-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital
19525	-Continue methadone while in house
19526	#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin
19527	-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)
19528	#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
19529	#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax
19530	#) Dispo: likely home pending cardiac w/u
19531	#) CODE: FULL (discussed with patient)

19544	He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.
19545	He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.
19546	At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.
19547	"Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like ""I was being crushed like a sandwich."""
19548	Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.
19549	EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA.
19550	On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.
19551	His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.
19552	On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ?
19553	aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.
19554	He received ASA and SLTNG
19555	Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).
19556	No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.
19557	Course on floor:
19558	Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.
19559	During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.
19560	BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63.
19561	(2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.
19562	Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia.

19564	Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather.
19565	Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.
19566	On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.
19567	He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.
19568	SDU Course:
19569	For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.

19692	"Re:	Russell Urban	"
19693	"WRH#	4722064	"
19694	Dear Dr. Ussery:
19695	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
19696	As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.
19697	He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
19698	By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.
19699	He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.
19700	That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
19701	He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
19702	The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
19703	Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
19704	He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
19705	This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
19706	A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
19707	He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
19708	A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.
19709	This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
19710	His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
19711	Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
19712	He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
19713	Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
19714	He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
19715	He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.
19716	He has felt very well.
19717	He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
19718	His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
19719	Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
19720	He was evaluated and released.
19721	He never had any further testing.
19722	He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
19723	Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
19724	His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.
19725	He has no known drug allergies.
19726	Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
19727	He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
19728	He has been working in Borders.
19729	He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.
19730	He has no children.
19731	He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
19732	He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
19733	He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
19734	On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.
19735	His heart rate is 60 and regular.
19736	In general, he is in no apparent distress.
19737	His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
19738	His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
19739	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
19740	He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
19741	His abdomen is benign.
19742	His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
19743	On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
19744	His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
19745	His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
19746	The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
19747	His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
19748	His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.
19749	His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
19750	He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
19751	Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
19752	He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.
19753	His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
19754	His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
19755	There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
19756	His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
19757	In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
19758	Also, his systolic function has improved over time.
19759	I think there are two processes going on.
19760	One is coronary artery disease.
19761	Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
19762	The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
19763	Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
19764	He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.
19765	I suspect that this is myocarditis.
19766	Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
19767	It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
19768	From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.
19769	He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.
19770	For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
19771	His LDL goal will be less than 100.
19772	He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.
19773	His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
19774	I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
19775	I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
19776	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
19777	The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.

19794	Dear Dr. Ussery:
19795	I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.
19796	Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.
19797	He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.
19798	Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.
19799	He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.
19800	He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.
19801	He has stopped smoking.
19802	There have been no difficulties with his medications.
19803	On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.
19804	Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.
19805	He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.
19806	His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.
19807	Medications:
19808	Aspirin 325 mg daily
19809	Plavix 75 mg daily 
19810	Lipitor 40 mg daily
19811	lisinopril 10 mg daily
19812	Coreg 6.25 mg daily.
19813	Physical examination:
19814	He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.
19815	His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.
19816	His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.
19817	His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
19818	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
19819	He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.
19820	His abdomen is soft.
19821	It is neither tender nor distended.
19822	He has normal bowel sounds.
19823	His extremities are warm and well perfused.
19824	He has no edema.
19825	Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.
19826	Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.
19827	He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.
19828	Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.
19829	The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.
19830	There is likely a component of left heart failure.
19831	In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.
19832	He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.
19833	This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.
19834	Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.
19835	The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.
19836	To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.
19837	If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.
19838	I will see him again in six months' time.
19839	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.
19840	Regards,

19852	"History of Present Illness	"
19853	     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93.
19854	He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward.
19855	Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.
19856	He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia.
19857	EF at that time was 51%.
19858	He has done reasonably well since then.
19859	In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion.
19860	He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95.
19861	EKG was positive for ischemia.
19862	Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia.
19863	His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.
19864	Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA.
19865	Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions.
19866	His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results.
19867	He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

20129	His current blood sugar readings are fasting 95-131 but 2 hrs after meals in the afternoon and evening have ranges from 159-276. he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate.
20130	I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage.
20131	P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while.
20132	he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes.
20133	I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week.

20590	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
20591	Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.
20592	He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
20593	"While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure""."
20594	He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes.
20595	There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.
20596	"An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG."
20597	Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized.
20598	"On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels."
20599	Stent placement was not attempted.
20600	His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward.
20601	A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 
20602	ASA 81 mg
20603	Plavix 75 mg po qd
20604	Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
20605	Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
20606	Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
20607	Lipitor 40 mg po qd
20608	A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
20609	Metformin 1000 mg po bid
20610	Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital.
20611	He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes.
20612	It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:
20613	Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.
20614	Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.
20615	No chest pain was    reported.
20616	Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.
20617	The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.
20618	See exercise report for full ECG details.
20619	Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.
20620	There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.
20621	Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
20622	Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%.
20623	No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.
20624	Trace mitral regurgitation.4.
20625	Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.
20626	All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
20627	Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.
20628	At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.
20629	Glycemic control ahs been variable.

20700	Dear Gray:
20701	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
20702	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
20703	I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
20704	I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
20705	The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
20706	At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
20707	He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
20708	He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal).
20709	An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
20710	An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
20711	Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
20712	Since then, he has had no further episodes.
20713	ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope.
20714	He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
20715	PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).
20716	Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening.
20717	This is an Equadorian formulation.
20718	SHx:
20719	He does not drink, nor smoke.
20720	FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
20721	Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
20722	On exam, he looks well.
20723	His heart rate is in the 64.
20724	His blood pressure was 115/70.
20725	His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
20726	His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
20727	His chest was clear to auscultation.
20728	His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
20729	His abdomen was soft.
20730	Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
20731	Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
20732	In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease.
20733	He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
20734	I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.
20735	With warm regards,  
20736	Sincerely yours,

20742	Dear Dr. Jean:
20743	Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .
20744	He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.
20745	Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.
20746	On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal.
20747	The  incision is healing very nicely.
20748	Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.
20749	EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.
20750	His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker.
20751	Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.
20752	Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.
20753	He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.
20754	He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.
20755	Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.
20756	I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .
20757	I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up.
20758	I am releasing  him to your care.
20759	We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.
20760	With warm regards,  
20761	Sincerely yours,

21031	Record date: 2129-05-10
21032	Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.
21033	Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.
21034	Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
21035	Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.
21036	When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
21037	Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
21038	Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
21039	Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
21040	Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.
21041	so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
21042	We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
21043	"He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
21044	OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.
21045	Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.
21046	DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.
21047	Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.
21048	UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.
21049	Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.
21050	Optho and podiatry current.
21051	Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.

21054	Vital Signs
21055	BP 118/70, Wt 235 lb
21056	well controlled.
21057	Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.
21058	Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.
21059	Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.
21060	Insomnia : since service.
21061	NTI helped a little in past, not after a while.
21062	CBT might help if successful.
21063	Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.
21064	Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.
21065	Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

21072	"			Reason for visit:"
21073	   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
21074	Interval History:
21075	   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
21076	A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
21077	An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
21078	The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion.
21079	HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA.
21080	1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
21081	His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.
21082	An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
21083	Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
21084	He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
21085	(BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2.
21086	An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
21087	Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters.
21088	He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
21089	In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief.
21090	He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
21091	An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
21092	He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done.
21093	It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.
21094	Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held.
21095	He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
21096	He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
21097	Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.
21098	(2 liters NP)
21099	Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent.
21100	Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

21212	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 
21213	woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 
21214	episode on the premises.
21215	A code was called when bystanders and 
21216	medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.
21217	The 
21218	patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 
21219	Emergency Department.
21220	The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.
21221	She took her 
21222	medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 
21223	nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.
21224	Her 
21225	other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.
21226	No epigastric 
21227	pain or tenderness and no chest pain.
21228	The patient never had any 
21229	chest pain prior to her event.
21230	She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point.
21231	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 
21232	significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 
21233	migraines.
21234	MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 
21235	Calan slow release and Glucophage.
21236	ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 
21237	Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril.
21238	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.
21239	LUNGS: 
21240	Clear bilaterally.
21241	CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 
21242	murmurs.
21243	ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
21244	EXTREMITIES:  Normal.
21245	GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here.
21246	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 
21247	was 160.
21248	Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 
21249	leads.
21250	No significant ST elevations.
21251	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 
21252	year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 
21253	premises.
21254	A code was called overhead.
21255	Bystanders reported that 
21256	the patient was diaphoretic.
21257	They gave her something to drink.
21258	Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.
21259	The patient has no 
21260	complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
21261	She looks well 
21262	but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 
21263	or gallops on her electrocardiogram.
21264	The patient was made NPO 
21265	because of her cystoscopy procedure.
21266	FINAL DIAGNOSES: 
21267	1.
21268	Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 
21269	diabetes medicine this morning.
21270	2.
21271	PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.
21272	No 
21273	old electrocardiogram to compare.
21274	We need to address the PR 
21275	depressions.
21276	This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.
21277	I 
21278	would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis.
21279	3.
21280	Cardiac ischemia.
21281	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 
21282	need admission and a formal rule out.
21283	She may even need an 
21284	echocardiogram inpatient.
21285	A full work up is pending.
21286	patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 
21287	Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

21296	Gibson Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note
21297	PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
21298	MRN:  8099832
21299	ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
21300	PCP:  unknown
21301	CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital
21302	HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.
21303	At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.
21304	As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.
21305	Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.
21306	Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.
21307	During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.
21308	At present, pt.
21309	c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.
21310	She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.
21311	Hospital Course: 
21312	MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt.
21313	was started on IV vancomycin.
21314	The bacteremic source remains unclear.
21315	TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.
21316	A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.
21317	Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.
21318	A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
21319	Back pain: Pt.
21320	c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.
21321	Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.
21322	An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.
21323	The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.
21324	No epidural extension was noted.
21325	There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.
21326	Pt.
21327	received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.
21328	As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.
21329	A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.
21330	A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.
21331	A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.
21332	Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.
21333	Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.
21334	A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.
21335	The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.
21336	An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.
21337	A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.
21338	Renal failure:  Pt.
21339	developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.
21340	Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.
21341	Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.
21342	Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.
21343	She was started on procrit by hematology.
21344	She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
21345	TIA:  Pt.
21346	has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.
21347	An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.
21348	This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.
21349	A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.
21350	No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.
21351	HTN: Pt.
21352	required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.

21453	Record date: 2102-12-01
21454	ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.
21455	HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.
21456	Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.
21457	Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.
21458	Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.
21459	She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.
21460	In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.
21461	She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.
21462	She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.
21463	Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.
21464	She was transferred to GCH in August.
21465	She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.
21466	She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.
21467	She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.
21468	She was discharged to rehab in mid September.
21469	She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.
21470	She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.
21471	She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.
21472	She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.
21473	The arm swelling quickly resolved.
21474	There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.
21475	She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.

21489	Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on.
21490	Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12/04/02 was 6.0.
21491	Bun /Cr was 11/0.9.
21492	glucose 196.
21493	Cholesterol 225/68/135.
21494	LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.
21495	If normalized then will add back Lipitor.
21496	History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.
21497	2)  Hypertension.
21498	Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.
21499	3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.
21500	Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.
21501	With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.
21502	She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.
21503	INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.
21504	4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.
21505	Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.
21506	5)  History of hypothyroidism.
21507	Had recent labs at SRH on  12/04/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of  0.9.
21508	6)  History of anemia, requiring Procrit and ?
21509	transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on  12/04/02.
21510	7)  Neuro;  History of partial seizures, TIA's.
21511	Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.
21512	History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.
21513	History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ?
21514	TIA left hemisphere, ?
21515	repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.
21516	On Plavix and coumadin.
21517	Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.

21532	Syncope
21533	HPI: 
21534	Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.
21535	Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099.
21536	She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures.
21537	She was started on Depakote for this.
21538	Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures.
21539	EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.
21540	In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope.
21541	Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.
21542	Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.
21543	When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.
21544	These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.
21545	Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.
21546	She does not recall the events herself.
21547	The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).
21548	The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.
21549	In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.
21550	She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management.
21551	The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.
21552	Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.
21553	The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.
21554	She denies fevers/chills.
21555	No chest pain, palpitations.
21556	Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.
21557	Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.
21558	She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.

21726	EKG: Sinus at 86.
21727	Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.
21728	CXR 7/28: NAD
21729	Chest CT 4/03: 
21730	IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
21731	     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
21732	     apex.
21733	Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
21734	     tiny lung nodules seen.
21735	MRI 9/02
21736	     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
21737	     ischemia.
21738	There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
21739	     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
21740	     hole or craniotomy.
21741	There are chronic appearing, small right
21742	     cerebellar infarcts.
21743	There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
21744	     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
21745	     with small vessel ischemic change.
21746	There is FLAIR hyperintensity
21747	     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
21748	     parietal and left occipital lobes.
21749	No abnormal enhancement is
21750	     seen.
21751	The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
21752	     unremarkable.
21753	The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
21754	There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
21755	There is
21756	     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
21757	There are
21758	     bilateral lens implants.
21759	The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
21760	     otherwise unremarkable.
21761	MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
21762	     posterior cerbral artery.
21763	There is diffuse irregularity of the
21764	     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.
21765	There is moderate
21766	     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
21767	The
21768	     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.
21769	     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
21770	     the circle of Willis.
21771	Impression:
21772	     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
21773	     predominance as described.
21774	This could represent hemorrhage, high
21775	     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
21776	     injection.
21777	Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
21778	     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.
21779	Diffuse irregularity
21780	     of the left posterior cerebral artery.
21781	These findings could be
21782	     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
21783	     vasculitis is another possibility.
21784	Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
21785	No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
21786	Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
21787	Small vessel ischemic changes.

21792	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
21793	BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.
21794	Echo    01
21795	Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
21796	    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.
21797	Left ventricular
21798	    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.
21799	There is no flattening of the
21800	    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
21801	    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
21802	    arterial pressure.
21803	There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
21804	    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
21805	There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
21806	    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
21807	There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
21808	    represent atherosclerotic change.
21809	The aortic valve is trileaflet.
21810	Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
21811	    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
21812	    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
21813	    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.
21814	There is no evident aortic stenosis
21815	    or aortic insufficiency.
21816	Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.
21817	Otherwise,
21818	    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.
21819	Normal appearing tricuspid
21820	    and pulmonary leaflets.
21821	There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
21822	    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
21823	Flow velocity could not be optimally
21824	    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
21825	    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
21826	There is no evident pericardial effusion.
21827	ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
21828	1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.
21829	History from family sounds much more like seizure.
21830	Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.
21831	Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.
21832	Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.

21851	Dear Dr. Mcfarland:
21852	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.
21853	As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture.
21854	Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies.
21855	She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.
21856	Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.
21857	She has had a negative cardiac stress test.
21858	PMH as above
21859	Meds: synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa
21860	Allergies: PCN, cephalosporins, vancomysin, shellfish
21861	SH: no tobacco ever.
21862	She is a professional tool maker.
21863	She has a dog
21864	FH: asthma, CAD, DM, HTN
21865	ROS: as per HPI, otherwise negative in detail

21878	PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal.
21879	There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator.
21880	The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit.
21881	Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated.
21882	Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.
21883	IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial.
21884	It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed.
21885	In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab.
21886	Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture.
21887	There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either.
21888	I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her.
21889	I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma.
21890	We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.
21891	Seen and d/w Dr. Weller

22762	Re:  William Potts
22763	     MR#  109-16-75-8
22764	Dear Matt:
22765	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.
22766	As you
22767	know, he recently had a complicated hospital course.
22768	He underwent
22769	cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD
22770	including 70% and 90% stenoses.
22771	The first marginal branch had a
22772	60% ostial stenosis.
22773	The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
22774	stenoses, respectively.
22775	The PDA had a 70% narrowing.
22776	Given his
22777	very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to
22778	proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
22779	the obtuse marginal.
22780	It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,
22781	and not worth going after at this time.
22782	The RCA was successfully
22783	stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left
22784	ventricular branch.
22785	By the end of the procedure, flow had been
22786	restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,
22787	but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
22788	infarction.
22789	Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
22790	branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.
22791	Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure.
22792	The second
22793	exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.
22794	He exercised for
22795	nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest
22796	pain.
22797	He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
22798	of 121.
22799	MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
22800	infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.
22801	There was
22802	moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
22803	territory of the RCA.
22804	Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts
22805	undergo bypass surgery.
22806	Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,
22807	Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d.
22808	He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
22809	Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
22810	recently.
22811	His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
22812	William Potts
22813	MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070
22814	from a hip fracture.
22815	He is having difficulty arranging the
22816	appropriate insurance to cover her medications.
22817	Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.
22818	This
22819	occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest
22820	and/or 1 nitroglycerin.
22821	He has decreased his work level
22822	considerably, and is relatively sedentary.
22823	On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.
22824	He had
22825	a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.
22826	His weight
22827	was 203 pounds.
22828	Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion.
22829	Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI
22830	with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
22831	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
22832	His abdomen is soft,
22833	nontender.
22834	There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux.
22835	Extremities are without edema.
22836	Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61.
22837	Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees.
22838	There are
22839	flipped T-waves in III and AVF.
22840	I did not have an old
22841	electrocardiogram here for comparison.
22842	Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with
22843	mild exertion.
22844	He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
22845	surgery.
22846	He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
22847	by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this.
22848	There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
22849	return to work as an actor.
22850	Given Mr. Potts's current
22851	feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon
22852	as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
22853	It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
22854	year-old mother at home, along with his wife.
22855	His mother currently
22856	uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot
22857	exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
22858	the house.
22859	He understands this, and if his chest pain should
22860	become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately
22861	call me.
22862	If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two
22863	weeks at NDNH.
22864	With best regards.
22865	Sincerely,

23182	MRN#:  8913196
23183	Date of Consult:  7/26/78
23184	Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg
23185	HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.
23186	He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.
23187	He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot.
23188	There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78.
23189	He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well.
23190	The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.
23191	No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.
23192	During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.
23193	The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.
23194	The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.
23195	He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.
23196	Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

23256	Physical Examination:  
23257	General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
23258	Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.
23259	On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.
23260	It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.
23261	The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.
23262	The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.
23263	No odor.
23264	There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.
23265	Distal pulses palpable.
23266	Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.
23267	There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.
23268	The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.
23269	Relevant Laboratory Values:
23270	Pending
23271	Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.
23272	This may be amenable to local flap coverage.
23273	Recommendations: 
23274	-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
23275	-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
23276	-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
23277	-Continue daily dressing changes for now.
23278	The patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.

23285	Medical Record: 8913196
23286	Attending:  Snyder
23287	History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.
23288	Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.
23289	The wound was overlying the BPG.
23290	He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.
23291	He has been followed in clinic.
23292	Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.
23293	In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
23294	The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.
23295	He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.
23296	His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
23297	No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
23298	Past Medical History:

24171	CONTACT: 
24172	Daughter, Sally, at 011-053-5691 
24173	Code status: 
24174	DNR/DNI
24175	Source: Patient, patient record
24176	CC: hypotension  
24177	HPI: 
24178	65 y/o F with colon cancer (known, surgery/GI refuse to proceduralize), ESRD on HD (M/W/F), CVA c/b severe residual speech/cognitive deficits, HTN, recurrent GIB who presents with hypotension.
24179	She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation.
24180	Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done.
24181	No report of recent GI bleeding.
24182	In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s.
24183	Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%.
24184	Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given.
24185	Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.)
24186	Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection.
24187	CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis.
24188	After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus.
24189	Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7.
24190	Patient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions.
24191	Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.
24192	When daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care.
24193	She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics.

24367	-continue cefepime 1 gm daily
24368	-vanc 1 gm with HD
24369	-consider diagnostic paracentesis tonight (daughter said this procedure seems reasonable), but would be of limited value given diagnostic only and more likely source of UTI
24370	-with finding of proctitis on CT, will add IV flagyl 
24371	Hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions: on 4-5 L, suspect fluid overload as culprit
24372	-could consider therapeutic thoracentesis if this would allow more aggressive fluid resuscitation, but should discuss with daughter first
24373	ESRD: renal following, will consider HD tomorrow, pending labs/hemodynamics

24397	RE:  Shilpa Pickett
24398	     MR #129-53-47-3
24399	Dear Philip:
24400	I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
24401	Clinic today.
24402	Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
24403	she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
24404	chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain.
24405	She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
24406	is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
24407	position.
24408	As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
24409	of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.
24410	Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
24411	po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.
24412	Of note, she was
24413	taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.
24414	Labetalol 200
24415	mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
24416	mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
24417	On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
24418	seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12.
24419	There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
24420	Carotids are free
24421	of bruits.
24422	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
24423	Cardiac
24424	exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.
24425	Abdomen
24426	is soft and nontender.
24427	The extremities are free of edema.
24428	Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
24429	block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
24430	In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
24431	factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
24432	increase in weight.
24433	We will be rechecking her lipid profile today.
24434	She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
24435	she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.
24436	She
24437	notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression.
24438	She has had no change in her hair or skin.
24439	For the 
24440	Pickett, Shilpa
24441	MR #129-53-47-3               -2-            October 13, 2061
24442	moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
24443	dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
24444	hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.
24445	It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
24446	Pickett' care.
24447	Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
24448	can be of help with.
24449	Sincerely,

24467	couple of weeks she has had increased chest palpitations and two 
24468	weeks ago was given an event monitor which he has intermittently 
24469	worn saying it is difficult to wear during the heat wave.
24470	This 
24471	a.m. the patient had a syncopal episode while watching a 
24472	disagreement between her two grandchildren.
24473	The patient states had 
24474	no chest pain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.
24475	The patient fell to 
24476	the floor and awoke, denies incontinence or tongue biting.

24512	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
24513	numerous complaints.
24514	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
24515	since her upper respiratory tract infection.
24516	She had the flu in January 
24517	and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
24518	weeks ago.
24519	She states that this has severely debilitated her.
24520	She is 
24521	complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
24522	occasional dull headache.
24523	However, her main concern is her stomach and 
24524	her back.
24525	Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
24526	in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.
24527	This is different than her 
24528	reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
24529	Prilosec-Propulsid combination.
24530	She is describing some anorexia, although 
24531	she has not lost any weight.
24532	She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
24533	movements.
24534	She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.
24535	She wonders 
24536	whether this could be in gallbladder.
24537	In addition, she is continuing to 
24538	have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
24539	distribution.
24540	She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
24541	back.
24542	Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.
24543	She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.
24544	Her sugars 
24545	have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.
24546	Her blood 
24547	pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.
24548	She is saturating well.
24549	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.
24550	There was no JVD.
24551	Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ?
24552	S3 
24553	with no significant murmur.
24554	Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
24555	mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.
24556	Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.
24557	Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.
24558	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
24559	issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
24560	and cerebrovascular disease.
24561	She came in today for discussion of her 
24562	ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
24563	With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
24564	codeine, which has helped in the past.
24565	I gave her a prescription.
24566	I 
24567	warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.
24568	She should 
24569	contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
24570	steroid injection.
24571	With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
24572	postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
24573	disease.
24574	Unclear contribution from her reflux.
24575	Dr. Mario Robison 
24576	recommended elective cholecystectomy.
24577	Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
24578	being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to 
24579	page 2 
24580	consider her for the surgery.
24581	I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
24582	make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
24583	make an informed decision about the surgery.
24584	She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
24585	a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.
24586	She would probably do better 
24587	with lower blood pressure.
24588	We could consider increasing her Imdur.
24589	I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

24712	REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.
24713	Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.
24714	She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
24715	She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.
24716	She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.
24717	She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
24718	There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.
24719	She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.
24720	She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
24721	There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
24722	The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.
24723	The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
24724	She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.
24725	She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
24726	Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.
24727	She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
24728	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
24729	and atenolol 50 mg q.d.
24730	She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
24731	Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
24732	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
24733	She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
24734	Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
24735	On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.
24736	Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.
24737	Head and neck were unremarkable.
24738	Chest is clear.
24739	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
24740	PMI is normal.
24741	S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.
24742	There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
24743	There is no S3.
24744	Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
24745	Bowel sounds are normal.
24746	Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
24747	Calf site is clean without bruits.
24748	Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
24749	Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
24750	Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.
24751	Liver function tests are normal.
24752	A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.
24753	Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
24754	She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.
24755	At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.
24756	We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.
24757	She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
24758	At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

24857	The patient was seen in conjunction with the resident, Dr.
24858	Vue.
24859	Resident's note was reviewed.
24860	The patient was seen and
24861	examined by me.
24862	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 73-year-old woman
24863	with extensive cardiac history of hypertension and coronary
24864	artery disease, IMI with any EF 40%, history of V-TACH, high
24865	cholesterol, insulin-dependent diabetes, and status post AICD
24866	cardiac catheterization and in the past.
24867	The patient was in the
24868	Emergency Department today visiting a family member.
24869	She was
24870	completely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which
24871	showed a pressure of 190/98.
24872	The patient states that she usually
24873	takes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the
24874	prescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has
24875	been taking only 4 of the 9.
24876	She is unable to say exactly which

25326	   Since last seen, Ursula notes that her weight continues to rise, and with this, her angina is clearly worse.
25327	She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.
25328	Medications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage

25351	   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.
25352	Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.
25353	First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.
25354	She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.
25355	She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.
25356	It gets better when she rests.
25357	She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.
25358	Her sugars are out of control.
25359	Her weight is down, nonetheless.

25503	RE:  Jennifer Vance
25504	     MR #542-66-00-3
25505	Dear Vester:
25506	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
25507	evaluation.
25508	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
25509	briefly for our records.
25510	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
25511	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
25512	significant coronary artery disease.
25513	In 2061, after a four to five
25514	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
25515	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
25516	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
25517	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
25518	inadequate results.
25519	She therefore was taken electively for
25520	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
25521	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
25522	She subsequently continued to
25523	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
25524	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
25525	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
25526	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
25527	The catheterization
25528	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
25529	artery graft.
25530	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
25531	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
25532	She recently has undergone an
25533	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
25534	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
25535	Trials
25536	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
25537	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
25538	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
25539	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
25540	She had no
25541	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
25542	Over the past two weeks
25543	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
25544	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
25545	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
25546	The pain is not
25547	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
25548	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
25549	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a
25550	cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.
25551	Vance, Jennifer
25552	MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069
25553	Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin
25554	dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's
25555	contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.
25556	Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,
25557	NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.
25558	Allergies:  None.
25559	Cigarettes - none.
25560	Ethanol - social.
25561	Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,
25562	mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one
25563	brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother
25564	dying from melanoma age 36.
25565	The rest of her siblings and children
25566	have not heart disease.
25567	Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.
25568	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,
25569	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.
25570	The neck is
25571	supple.
25572	JVP flat.
25573	Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
25574	greater than left bruits.
25575	Chest is clear.
25576	Cardiac exam shows a
25577	normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection
25578	murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant
25579	diastolic murmur.
25580	The abdomen is benign.
25581	Extremities reveal no
25582	appreciable edema.
25583	Peripheral pulses are intact.
25584	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
25585	PR interval
25586	of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.
25587	There are minor
25588	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
25589	Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
25590	variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and
25591	dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
25592	She has had a
25593	retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
25594	most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
25595	significant provokable ischemia.
25596	Nonetheless, I am concerned that
25597	her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
25598	I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
25599	I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
25600	studies.
25601	In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
25602	dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive
25603	antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
25604	Unless her variegata porphyria
25605	precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po
25606	q.d.
25607	I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
25608	In
25609	addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d.
25610	and
25611	I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
25612	porphyria does not 
25613	MR #542-66-00-3                    -3-            July 18, 2069
25614	preclude this.
25615	She understands that if she has evidence for
25616	significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
25617	to undergo repeat coronary angiography.
25618	Thank you very much for
25619	allowing me to assist in her care.

25669	The neck is supple.
25670	JVP 
25671	is flat.
25672	Carotids  with continuing right greater than left bruits.

25675	split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the
25676	apex to the base.
25677	No significant diastolic murmur.
25678	The abdomen is
25679	benign.
25680	Extremities are without edema.

25795	Dear Wanda:
25796	Mr. Vance returns for followup.
25797	Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.
25798	She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.
25799	Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.
25800	After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.
25801	Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.
25802	As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.
25803	Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous.
25804	q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o.
25805	q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
25806	q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o.
25807	q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o.
25808	q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o.
25809	t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n.
25810	which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
25811	q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o.
25812	q.d., and p.r.n.
25813	Motrin.
25814	Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.
25815	Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.
25816	The neck is supple.
25817	JVP is flat.
25818	Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.
25819	Chest is clear.
25820	Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.
25821	No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
25822	The abdomen is benign.
25823	Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.
25824	Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.
25825	Electrocardiogram is pending.
25826	Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.
25827	However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.
25828	She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.
25829	Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.
25830	Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.
25831	I have not further altered her medical regimen.
25832	Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
25833	Sincerely yours,

25850	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
25851	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
25852	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
25853	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
25854	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
25855	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
25856	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
25857	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
25858	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
25859	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
25860	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
25861	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
25862	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
25863	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.
25864	Past medical history:
25865	   Hypertension.
25866	Hyperlipidemia.
25867	CAD.
25868	PAD.
25869	Prior tobacco use.

25874	Congenital hypospadias.
25875	Prostatitis.
25876	Hemorrhoids.
25877	Colonic polyps.
25878	Chronic normocytic anemia.

25890	-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress
25891	-Heent:   Benign
25892	-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits
25893	-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs
25894	-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
25895	S1 and S2.
25896	There is no murmur, rub, or gallop
25897	-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.
25898	There are no masses or bruits appreciated
25899	-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.
25900	Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.
25901	Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration
25902	-BP: 145/80    on the right
25903	"	Other Data:"
25904	   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.
25905	Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.
25906	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
25907	Assessment and plan:
25908	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
25909	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
25910	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
25911	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
25912	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
25913	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
25914	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
25915	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
25916	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
25917	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
25918	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
25919	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
25920	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
25921	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
25922	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
25923	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

25955	Dear Dr. Cooper:
25956	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease.
25957	I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.
25958	Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.
25959	This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.
25960	The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.
25961	They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.
25962	While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.
25963	He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.
25964	The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.
25965	As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight.
25966	He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.
25967	He is struggling with the decision.
25968	I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.
25969	In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.
25970	Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.
25971	He has no ulcers or gangrene.
25972	From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.
25973	He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.
25974	It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.
25975	While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.
25976	He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.
25977	Otherwise, Chris is doing great.
25978	We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.
25979	We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.
25980	If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.
25981	Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.
25982	Other Data:
25983	   I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note.
25984	We will send this along to you as well.

26105	RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.
26106	Dear Dr. Cooper:
26107	  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes.
26108	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
26109	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
26110	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
26111	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
26112	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
26113	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
26114	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
26115	He returns today for review.
26116	He remains in reasonable health.
26117	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
26118	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
26119	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
26120	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
26121	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.

26184	Impression:
26185	   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication.
26186	He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia.
26187	Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.
26188	Assessment and plan:

26190	CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.
26191	2.
26192	PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.
26193	3.
26194	Carotid disease; currently asymptomatic, will repeat CANIs.

26224	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.
26225	Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG.
26226	He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors.
26227	but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.

26496	      Assessment and plan:
26497	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
26498	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
26499	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
26500	Problems:
26501	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
26502	Takes it about once/month.
26503	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
26504	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
26505	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
26506	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
26507	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
26508	Continue her present dose of statin.
26509	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
26510	Continue her current regimen.

26533	History of Present Illness
26534	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
26535	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
26536	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
26537	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
26538	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
26539	He presents now for cath and surgery.

26644	Record date: 2067-08-02
26645	60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.
26646	It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.
26647	He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.
26648	He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.
26649	In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.
26650	Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.
26651	He was discharged without clear follow-up.
26652	The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.
26653	He has been ambulating on the wound.
26654	He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.
26655	He reports no pain.
26656	Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.
26657	Review of systems is otherwise negative.

26705	Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable but clearly diminished.
26706	Assessment and plan: This is a 60 year old gentleman with multiple medical issues including end-stage renal disease my for regurgitation, congestive heart failure, severe peripheral neuropathy, diabetes.
26707	Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity.
26708	He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status.
26709	I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained.
26710	A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday.
26711	Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim.
26712	He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times.
26713	I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.
26714	With regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.
26715	I have asked for a hemoglobin A1c and fasting cholesterol to be drawn at the time of his dialysis tomorrow.
26716	I'll see the patient on Tuesday.
26717	His blood pressure is appropriately controlled and he is no stigmata of congestive heart failure

26866	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
26867	Assessment/Plan
26868	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
26869	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
26870	S/P Rt TMA.
26871	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
26872	By issue:
26873	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
26874	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
26875	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
26876	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
26877	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
26878	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
26879	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
26880	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
26881	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
26882	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
26883	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
26884	Might hold ranitidine as well.
26885	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
26886	Currently on olanzapine.
26887	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
26888	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
26889	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
26890	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
26891	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
26892	Would seek ID input to the end.
26893	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
26894	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
26895	Recs per nephrology
26896	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
26897	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
26898	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
26899	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
26900	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
26901	Thanks,

27113	Dear Dr. Huerta:
27114	Reason for visit:
27115	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
27116	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
27117	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
27118	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
27119	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
27120	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
27121	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
27122	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
27123	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
27124	The patient has been managed medically since then.
27125	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
27126	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
27127	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
27128	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
27129	His weight has been up and down.
27130	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
27131	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
27132	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
27133	Past medical history:
27134	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
27135	Current Medications:
27136	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
27137	 Glucophage 1 g BID
27138	 glyburide 10 mg BID
27139	 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM
27140	 Lopid 600 mg BID
27141	 allopurinol 300 mg QD
27142	 omeprazole 20 mg QD
27143	 aspirin 81 mg QD
27144	 Pravachol 80 mg QD
27145	 Avandia 8 mg QD
27146	Allergies:
27147	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
27148	Family history:
27149	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
27150	Social history:
27151	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
27152	Review of systems:
27153	   As above, otherwise negative.
27154	Physical examination:
27155	-Pulse:   60
27156	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
27157	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
27158	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
27159	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
27160	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
27161	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
27162	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
27163	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
27164	Selected recent labs:
27165	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
27166	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
27167	Assessment and plan:
27168	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
27169	He is doing well.
27170	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
27171	He is currently not anticoagulated.
27172	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
27173	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
27174	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
27175	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
27176	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
27177	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
27178	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
27179	Changes to Medications this visit

27339	CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation.
27340	HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter.
27341	Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR.
27342	Pt did well post cardioversion.
27343	He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis.
27344	Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically.
27345	Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology.
27346	He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter.
27347	Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73.
27348	The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm.
27349	He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

27522	NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly
27523	MRN:      3299811 
27524	INITIAL VISIT 
27525	This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit.
27526	The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
27527	recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
27528	syndrome and back/chest pain.
27529	Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
27530	She was found to have a blood
27531	pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
27532	headaches.
27533	She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
27534	found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
27535	She was transferred to the
27536	Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic
27537	convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
27538	She also suffered a urinary tract
27539	infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.
27540	She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,
27541	at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
27542	On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of
27543	127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.
27544	She had a myxedematous face and
27545	was obese.
27546	She was cardiovascularly stable.
27547	Neurologically, she was able to move
27548	all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
27549	Cranial nerves
27550	intact.
27551	Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to
27552	elevated blood pressure.
27553	Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
27554	Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar
27555	puncture, both of which were negative.
27556	Electroencephalogram was  performed and
27557	showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
27558	The patient's
27559	alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
27560	She had
27561	an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral
27562	leads.
27563	Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
27564	The patient underwent a course of
27565	physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
27566	A
27567	specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
27568	this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
27569	use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
27570	threshold for seizure activity.
27571	Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.
27572	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,
27573	panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone
27574	tumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.

27971	R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration
27972	Critical Care Min: 35 min
27973	History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness.
27974	BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived.
27975	Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.

27977	and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.
27978	She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.
27979	CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
27980	She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.

UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l
28014	Imaging/Studies/TCD: 
28015	Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.

28017	Assessment: 
28018	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
28019	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
28020	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.

28847	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
28848	gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
28849	post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
28850	1.
28851	He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.
28852	These are 
28853	improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
28854	128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
28855	ranging from 150 to 190.
28856	He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
28857	units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
28858	at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.
28859	He has not had any 
28860	further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
28861	seems to be sticking more to the diet.
28862	He has however gained some 
28863	weight, which is a little disconcerting.
28864	He does attend a podiatrist 
28865	and is doing well from that perspective.
28866	He is to return to the 
28867	ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.
28868	He 
28869	missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
28870	follow-up with nutrition at this time.
28871	2.
28872	Cardiovascular.
28873	He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
28874	atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.
28875	Further question regarding his stroke back 
28876	in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
28877	unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
28878	to have a hole in his heart at that time.
28879	He was eventually stopped off 
28880	Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
28881	put on Coumadin for life at that point.
28882	He had an aborted myocardial 
28883	infarction in 2067.
28884	He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
28885	exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
28886	yards before getting very short of breath.
28887	He has no orthopnea or PND.
28888	He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
28889	3.
28890	Health maintenance.
28891	We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
28892	flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.
28893	has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
28894	his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
28895	checked on the day prior to the test.
28896	This will be scheduled by our 
28897	secretary.
28898	He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
28899	standard dose and titrate up slowly.
28900	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
28901	Lipitor.
28902	Page 2
28903	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.
28904	He is tachycardic 
28905	at 98 beats per minute.
28906	Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
28907	sided cataract.
28908	Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.
28909	The 
28910	abdominal examination is also normal.
28911	His injection sites were clean 
28912	and without erythema.
28913	There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
28914	his feet appeared well.
28915	We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
28916	including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.
28917	PLAN:
28918	Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
28919	including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
28920	and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
28921	I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
28922	left the other doses as is.
28923	I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
28924	and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
28925	4.
28926	We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
28927	5.
28928	I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
28929	above for colorectal cancer screening.
28930	6.
28931	Return to see in a week's time, understands.
28932	He can discuss any 
28933	management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

28938	He is starting to improve his self-care of dm and last a1c was 8.2  Blood sugars mostly less than 250.
28939	Increased am insulin and will increase atenolol from 25--->50 mg for a bp of 150/88.

29900	  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.
29901	History of present illness
29902	  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.
29903	Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.
29904	He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.
29905	At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.
29906	He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.
29907	He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.
29908	He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.
29909	He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.
29910	He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.
29911	He is here for a followup.
29912	Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.
29913	His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

30010	He was volume depleted at his last visit.
30011	Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.
30012	His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.
30013	His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.
30014	His weight control has been a problem.
30015	He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.
30016	He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

30210	Hyperlipidemia.
30211	Sleep apnea.
30212	2/1/11 stroke 4/4/12 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Small posterolateral scar and ischemia  2/21/14 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Moderate-severe anterior apical and inferior ischemia.
30213	Medications: Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d., glipizide 10 mg b.i.d., Cozaar 50 mg, Zocor 20 mg, Detrol 2 mg, Colace, aspirin 81, isosorbide 40 mg q.a.m., multivitamin, glucosamine and chondroitin b.i.d., Naprosyn 220-2 pills b.i.d., Celexa 20 mg. BiPAP
30214	Reactions to Medicines: None
30215	Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness
30216	History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.
30217	He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
30218	In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
30219	He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
30220	On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.
30221	He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.
30222	He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.
30223	ROS:Const.-Negative
30224	Eyes -Negative
30225	ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss
30226	CV: See above
30227	Respiratory: Sleep apnea
30228	GI -.
30229	Recent constipation  
30230	GU -Impotence.
30231	Urgency and incontinence  
30232	MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.
30233	Considering knee replacement
30234	Skin - Negative
30235	Neuro -CVA in past.
30236	Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.
30237	Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa
30238	Endocrine -  Diabetes
30239	Heme-No blood problems
30240	Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye
30241	Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
30242	He has no other major illnesses.
30243	He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.
30244	Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.
30245	Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
30246	Two sisters are living without diabetes.
30247	Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.
30248	He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.
30249	His significant other works as an optician.
30250	She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.
30251	Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
30252	BP 100 50/65.
30253	His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.
30254	He has no rales.
30255	He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.
30256	He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
30257	EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA
30258	Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
30259	He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
30260	In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
30261	I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
30262	I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
30263	Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
30264	I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
30265	Of course the catheterization will determine that.
30266	He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

30422	ID Attending: Alexander Y Xian MD
30423	Referring Physician: Webster MD
30424	Date of Consult: September 20, 2073
30425	Reason for consult:  cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant
30426	HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.
30427	He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.
30428	He was free of disease since then until May 2073.
30429	He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).
30430	His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.
30431	He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.
30432	His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.
30433	It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.
30434	And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.
30435	He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).
30436	In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.
30437	In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.
30438	On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.
30439	CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.
30440	Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.
30441	He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.
30442	He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.

30507	Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable.

30510	There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC.
30511	No pneumothorax is seen .
30512	Impression:
30513	66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.
30514	The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.
30515	Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.
30516	However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.
30517	Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.
30518	While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.
30519	I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.
30520	My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.
30521	An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).
30522	Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.
30523	We recommend the following work-up:
30524	-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
30525	-Induced sputum for
30526	-PCP
30527	-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
30528	-Fungal stain and culture
30529	-Urine histo antigen
30530	-Serum cryptococcal antigen
30531	-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
30532	-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture
30533	If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.
30534	It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).
30535	Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.
30536	Thank you for this consult.
30537	Our team will follow with you

30544	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.
30545	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with
30546	a history of diabetes and myelodysplastic syndrome, status post
30547	stem cell transplant who presents to the Emergency Department
30548	with a 2 to 3 week history of increasing exertional dyspnea.
30549	The
30550	patient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does
30551	complain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks.
30552	The patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient

30750	-nasopharyngeal swab AND pertussis IgM/IgG for pertussis given persistent cough and low grade temps
30751	-f/u respiratory viral panel
30752	-given mild eosinophilia, can check strongyloides antibody and stool for ova and parasites though no clear exposure history, would also check urinary histo Ag and cocciodes IgM/IgG (given old granulomatous disease on chest CT)
30753	-would consider AM cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficiency 
30754	-would repeat hepatitis serologies (HepB sAG, cAB, sAB, HepA AB, HepC Ab) given persistent mildly elevated LFTs
30755	-would check toxoplasma DNA given risk of dz post-transplant

30956	EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^12/15/90^MARTIN, CONSTANCE
30957	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female
30958	with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and
30959	atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of
30960	sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.
30961	She
30962	said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.
30963	She also
30964	said it felt like a burning.
30965	She had mild shortness of breath
30966	and left arm achiness.
30967	She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers
30968	or chills.
30969	She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no
30970	syncope.
30971	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,
30972	and atrial fibrillation.
30973	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.
30974	SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.
30975	FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.
30976	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.
30977	MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,
30978	aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.
30979	ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.
30980	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,
30981	respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters.
30982	The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,
30983	talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.
30984	ENT: 
30985	Atraumatic, normal to inspection.
30986	Eyes are normal.
30987	Neck: 
30988	Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.
30989	Respiratory:  Clear
30990	to auscultation bilaterally.
30991	Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
30992	rhythm.
30993	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
30994	GI:  Abdomen is soft and
30995	nontender.
30996	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
30997	Back is nontender.
30998	Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema.
30999	Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.
31000	Mood and affect is normal.
31001	Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.
31002	No motor or
31003	sensory deficits.
31004	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about
31005	150, unclear.
31006	It seemed that there was T waves in V3.
31007	There is
31008	no evidence of ST elevation MI.
31009	We thought this could be an SVT.
31010	It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.
31011	Our
31012	plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement.
31013	Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal
31014	sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was
31015	clear that there was T waves.
31016	At this point, we decided to give
31017	her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.
31018	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium
31019	3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,
31020	glucose 268.
31021	ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,
31022	total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,
31023	calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.
31024	White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit
31025	42.7, and platelets 438, 000.
31026	INR is 1.
31027	UA is negative for
31028	infection with trace blood present.
31029	PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient
31030	had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.
31031	If both of
31032	those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home
31033	from the ED Observation Unit.
31034	It is unclear the etiology of her
31035	arrhythmia.
31036	It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke
31037	spontaneously.
31038	The patient is to follow up with her primary
31039	doctor.
31040	DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.
31041	CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.
31042	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,
31043	reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,
31044	discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the
31045	patient.

31053	Record date: 2062-10-30
31054	54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.
31055	Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.
31056	He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.
31057	Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.
31058	He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.
31059	He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.
31060	So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.
31061	"After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions."
31062	Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.
31063	This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.
31064	He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.
31065	He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.
31066	He walks with a walker.
31067	He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.
31068	He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.
31069	He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.
31070	He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.
31071	He reports good glycemic control.

31106	Imp:
31107	54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.
31108	Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.
31109	Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.
31110	Plan:
31111	1) continue posaconazole
31112	2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection
31113	3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.
31114	Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.
31115	Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.
31116	He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.
31117	Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.
31118	On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.
31119	ECG without QTc prolongation.
31120	Abdomen is bening.
31121	Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

31131	The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse.
31132	Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill.
31133	The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment.
31134	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit.
31135	The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.
31136	Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand.
31137	He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight.

31393	History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.
31394	The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.
31395	"The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that ""the access had collapsed."""
31396	On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.
31397	At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.
31398	Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.
31399	Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.

31519	HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
31520	44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.
31521	She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated 
31522	creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
31523	evaluation.
31524	The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as 
31525	planned.
31526	"She states that she has been ""too busy."""
31527	Her only complaint 
31528	today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
31529	relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.
31530	Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.
31531	A noted in her 
31532	ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d.
31533	drug, however, 
31534	Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
31535	on an almost p.r.n.
31536	basis.
31537	Review of systems is essentially normal.
31538	Specifically, she denies any 
31539	headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.
31540	She also denies any 
31541	symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.
31542	She has no history of 
31543	dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
31544	Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.
31545	Vital signs are 
31546	significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.
31547	HEENT exam is unremarkable.
31548	Lungs are clear.
31549	Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
31550	S1, S2.
31551	No S3 is appreciated.
31552	There are no murmurs or rubs.
31553	Abdomen is 
31554	slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.
31555	No masses are 
31556	appreciated.
31557	Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
31558	suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.
31559	Indeed, exam of 
31560	her legs is entirely unremarkable.
31561	Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
31562	sediment and a urine creatinine.
31563	Assessment and Plan:
31564	1.
31565	Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
31566	     on her Procardia.
31567	I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
31568	     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
31569	     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.
31570	I will see her in a few days in order 
31571	     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
31572	     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
31573	2.
31574	Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
31575	     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
31576	     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)
31577	I  have asked her to continue taking 
31578	     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
31579	     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.
31580	Page 2                                        29195561
31581	3.
31582	Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
31583	     appointment.
31584	In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
31585	     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.
31586	She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
31587	     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.
31588	Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
31589	     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
31590	     function.
31591	4.
31592	Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
31593	"     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long."""
31594	She is to see me 
31595	     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.
31596	Her 
31597	     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
31598	     will not be repeated until next year.

31616	An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.
31617	She is currently well with no complaints.
31618	She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.
31619	She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.
31620	When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.
31621	She's not had this recently.
31622	She also does not check her BP at home.
31623	She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.
31624	She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.

31884	21 Tamworth Place
31885	Galena, MN  64864
31886	Dear Dr. Trujillo:
31887	Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady
31888	with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do
31889	revascularization of the right leg.
31890	Her history is well known to
31891	you but I will repeat it for our records.
31892	She has a long history
31893	of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30
31894	years, stopping 15 years ago.
31895	She has developed claudication,
31896	particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her
31897	husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved
31898	by rest.
31899	This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also
31900	in the right thigh as well.
31901	She had segmental leg pressures done
31902	which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an
31903	ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.
31904	An MR angiogram
31905	showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this
31906	as yet.
31907	She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes
31908	mellitus, which she has had for 10 years.
31909	Her other cardiac risk
31910	factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of
31911	myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her
31912	cholesterol level is.
31913	She has no history of hypertension,
31914	although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the
31915	past.
31916	She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for
31917	a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in
31918	swallowing tablets and keeping them down.
31919	She also has a past
31920	history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma
31921	that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive
31922	therapy.
31923	She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was
31924	uneventful.
31925	Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,
31926	palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,
31927	weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual
31928	disturbances, and all other systems are negative.
31929	She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin
31930	only.
31931	She has no allergies.
31932	On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any
31933	signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.
31934	Her heart rate was 85
31935	beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms.
31936	The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid
31937	upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.
31938	Her apex
31939	beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second
31940	heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.
31941	Her chest
31942	was clear to percussion and auscultation.
31943	She had no
31944	hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.
31945	She
31946	had the scars from previous operations present.
31947	Her femoral
31948	pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side
31949	without bruits.
31950	She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and
31951	posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on
31952	the right leg.
31953	There were no trophic changes in her legs.
31954	had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf
31955	level in a stocking distribution.
31956	Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.
31957	Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and
31958	requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any
31959	myocardial ischemia.
31960	I therefore think a stress test is
31961	required.
31962	She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and
31963	this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her
31964	atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.
31965	Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess
31966	for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.
31967	I have also
31968	asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing
31969	her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,
31970	which is elevated.
31971	I have also asked her to have a fasting blood
31972	lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is
31973	likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.
31974	I
31975	plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after
31976	her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.
31977	I will let you know the results of her stress test when they
31978	become available.
31979	Thank you for allowing me to take part in this
31980	lady's care.
31981	Yours sincerely,

31999	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.
32000	In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.
32001	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.
32002	She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.
32003	She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.
32004	Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.
32005	At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.
32006	She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.
32007	She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.
32008	She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.
32009	Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.
32010	An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.
32011	She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.
32012	The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.
32013	Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.
32014	Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.
32015	She denies dysuria.
32016	The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.
32017	At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.
32018	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.
32019	Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.
32020	Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
32021	Random fingerstick glucose is 202.
32022	Extraocular movements are full.
32023	The thyroid is not enlarged.
32024	The neck veins are flat.
32025	The chest is clear to auscultation.
32026	The breasts are free of masses.
32027	There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
32028	The heart sounds are regular.
32029	There are no rubs or gallops.
32030	There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.
32031	There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.
32032	No other masses are palpable.
32033	The lower extremities are free of edema.
32034	I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.
32035	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
32036	She has not been compliant with her medications.
32037	She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.
32038	She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.
32039	She continues to consume three or four beers a day.
32040	The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.
32041	Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.
32042	Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.
32043	I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.
32044	I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
32045	q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
32046	q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
32047	q.d.
32048	She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.
32049	I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.
32050	I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.
32051	She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.
32052	An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

32250	MRI/MRA head and neck:
32251	Not yet completed.
32252	Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:
32253	The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are
32254	"	intact."
32255	Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at
32256	"	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere."
32257	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.
32258	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.
32259	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not
32260	"	associated with significant stenosis."
32261	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum
32262	"	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the"
32263	"	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen."
32264	There is narrowing
32265	"	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of"
32266	"	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as"
32267	"	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence."
32268	Old CT brain 6/16/89:
32269	Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are
32270	"	not uncommon for a patient of this age."
32271	There are no regions of

32278	_______________________________________________________________
32279	IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.
32280	She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).
32281	She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.
32282	Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.
32283	While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.
32284	She had persistent nausea and vomiting.
32285	Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.
32286	She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.
32287	Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.
32288	She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.
32289	She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.
32290	She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.
32291	While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.
32292	Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.
32293	RECOMMENDATIONS:
32294	1.
32295	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms
32296	2.
32297	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).
32298	3.
32299	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.
32300	Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.
32301	4.
32302	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen
32303	5.
32304	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s
32305	6.
32306	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).
32307	7.
32308	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.
32309	This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

32322	Dear Dr. Pearson: 
32323	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning.
32324	Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis.
32325	She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent.
32326	Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.
32327	Interval History
32328	Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago.
32329	She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair.
32330	She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties.
32331	Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy.
32332	According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year.
32333	Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96.
32334	Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months.
32335	A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma.
32336	This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent.
32337	"She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters."
32338	Her other children have not maintained close contact.
32339	Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time.
32340	Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094.
32341	Past Medical History
32342	type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin

32380	Speech fluent in Dutch.
32381	Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand.
32382	Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail.
32383	CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm.
32384	EOMI.
32385	Mild right UMN facial weakness.
32386	Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
32387	MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg.
32388	Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension).
32389	5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg.
32390	SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left.
32391	DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left.
32392	Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally.
32393	Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.
32394	CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger.
32395	MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 
32396	CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.
32397	CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel
32398	Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.
32399	Impression
32400	Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094.
32401	Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque.
32402	She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now.
32403	Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression.
32404	Plan
32405	1.
32406	We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
32407	2.
32408	We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control.
32409	Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
32410	3.
32411	Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy.
32412	Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl.
32413	I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time.
32414	4.
32415	I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep.
32416	After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
32417	5.
32418	Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.
32419	It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you.
32420	Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues.
32421	Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.
32422	Sincerely,

32716	Patient on Keppra in past-needed now?
32717	Will ask neurology
32718	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.
32719	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative
32720	4.
32721	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.
32722	5.
32723	Renal transplant-continue Prednisone

32736	RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
32737	MR #863-35-65-5
32738	Dear Dr. Faust: 
32739	Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
32740	Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
32741	Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
32742	it now for our records.
32743	Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
32744	at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
32745	health until the past year.
32746	He denies any prior history of
32747	hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
32748	childhood illnesses or malignancy.
32749	He describes his usual baseline
32750	health as excellent.
32751	He is a religious walker, walking multiple
32752	times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast.
32753	Dr.
32754	Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
32755	was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia.
32756	This was treated with
32757	Metformin.
32758	Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
32759	apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
32760	he has been diagnosed with hypertension).
32761	He subsequently developed
32762	diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
32763	subsequently reduced in dose.
32764	In June of the past year the patient
32765	was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
32766	Hydrochlorothiazide.
32767	At that time he also was found to have lower
32768	extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
32769	The patient states in September of 2119 he
32770	traveled to trinidad and tobago.
32771	While in trinidad and tobago he had a
32772	marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
32773	found it difficult to ambulate.
32774	He denied any difficulty with chest
32775	pains or shortness of breath.
32776	He had no hemoptysis and no focal
32777	unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
32778	during the trip.
32779	He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
32780	ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
32781	significantly.
32782	However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
32783	medication and it was stopped.
32784	Subsequently his lower extremity has
32785	once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
32786	Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn.
32787	At the present
32788	time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath.
32789	He
32790	still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any 
32791	Page 2
32792	limitation.
32793	He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
32794	in his lower extremities.
32795	He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
32796	sputum production, no hemoptysis.
32797	He has no fevers or chills.
32798	believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
32799	months.
32800	He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation.
32801	denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
32802	that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
32803	often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him.
32804	denies any history of snoring.
32805	He has noted no new joint complaints
32806	although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
32807	his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm.
32808	This has been
32809	present for approximately two or three months.
32810	Other than that he
32811	believes his bowel and bladder function is normal.
32812	Review of
32813	systems is otherwise unremarkable.
32814	His past medical history is significant for:
32815	     1.
32816	Type II diabetes as above.
32817	2.
32818	An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his 
32819	        chart.
32820	3.
32821	Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide.
32822	4.
32823	Past history of right bundle branch block.
32824	He has no      
32825	        history of rheumatic fever.
32826	Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,
32827	Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,
32828	compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently.
32829	Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
32830	Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus.
32831	Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
32832	immigrant from trinidad and tobago.
32833	He has been living in Haleyville
32834	since the early 2059's.
32835	He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo.
32836	has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his
32837	bachelor's degree but none since then.
32838	He is a non tobacco user.
32839	uses alcohol minimally.
32840	He's never had any blood transfusions.
32841	lives with his wife.
32842	They have no pets.
32843	He does not enjoy any
32844	unusual hobbies not noted above.
32845	He has been exposed to
32846	tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD.
32847	On physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds.
32848	Blood
32849	pressure is 136/90.
32850	Pulse 83 and regular.
32851	Respiratory rate is 20.
32852	Temperature is 96.8.
32853	Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with
32854	ambulation in the hallway.
32855	This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
32856	increase in his heart rate to 100.
32857	HEENT exam is significant for a
32858	clear oropharynx.
32859	Sclera are white.
32860	Conjunctiva are minimally pale.
32861	Page 3
32862	The thyroid gland is normal.
32863	Jugular venous distention to
32864	approximately 10 cm.
32865	was noted.
32866	Neck was supple.
32867	Examination of the
32868	chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
32869	at both bases.
32870	There was no egophony and no wheezes.
32871	Otherwise the
32872	lungs were clear.
32873	Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
32874	normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated.
32875	No RV heave
32876	or lift was appreciated.
32877	No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
32878	The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced.
32879	No appreciable
32880	murmurs were detected.
32881	The point of maximum impulse was in the
32882	anterior axillary line.
32883	Examination of the abdomen revealed a
32884	nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
32885	below the right costal margin.
32886	This was nontender and smooth.
32887	Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well.
32888	Normal bowel
32889	sounds were present.
32890	Examination of the extremities reveal three
32891	plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
32892	extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
32893	extremities.
32894	No clubbing was noted.
32895	There were no skin changes
32896	consistent with collagen vascular disease.
32897	Multiple follicular
32898	lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
32899	well as on the left arm.
32900	Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.
32901	Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
32902	white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
32903	Differential was not remarkable.
32904	LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
32905	most recently 22.
32906	A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
32907	protein.
32908	No reportive cast was made.
32909	A CEA was notable for a level
32910	of 2.4 on 1/05/20.
32911	An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
32912	demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
32913	LV function.
32914	The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
32915	hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function.
32916	There was trace
32917	MR with moderate TR.
32918	A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
32919	right atrial pressure was noted.
32920	In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
32921	pulmonary hypertension.
32922	The etiology of this is not clear at the
32923	moment.
32924	Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
32925	disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
32926	sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease.
32927	In addition some
32928	patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
32929	setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
32930	ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
32931	exclusion.
32932	The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
32933	with increasing his diuretic regimen.
32934	I'm embarking on a course of
32935	evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.
32936	In specific he will
32937	be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
32938	disease this afternoon.
32939	This has already been arranged by Dr.
32940	Faust.
32941	In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
32942	antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70.
32943	I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
32944	Page 4
32945	to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.
32946	will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
32947	pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
32948	arterial blood gas drawn.
32949	If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
32950	he may require more invasive diagnostics.
32951	I've already consulted
32952	formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
32953	experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
32954	be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
32955	workup is nondiagnostic.
32956	Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
32957	I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
32958	his diagnostic tests have been performed.
32959	Please do not hesitate to
32960	call me with any further questions or concerns.
32961	Sincerely,

33277	Dear Hicks,
33278	I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
33279	She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.
33280	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
33281	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
33282	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
33283	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
33284	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
33285	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
33286	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
33287	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
33288	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
33289	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
33290	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
33291	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
33292	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
33293	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
33294	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
33295	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
33296	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
33297	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
33298	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
33299	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
33300	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
33301	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
33302	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
33303	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
33304	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
33305	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
33306	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
33307	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
33308	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
33309	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
33310	Her abdomen is benign.
33311	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
33312	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
33313	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
33314	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
33315	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
33316	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
33317	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
33318	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
33319	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
33320	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
33321	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
33322	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
33323	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
33324	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
33325	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
33326	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
33327	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
33328	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
33329	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
33330	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
33331	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
33332	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
33333	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
33334	Sincerely,

33352	HPI: Ms. Hendricks is a 52yoF with a history of PVD and non-healing wounds of the LLE s/p redo left femoral-tibial bypass with arm vein on 5/3/78 who was discharged to home yesterday and now returns after she noted a gush of blood from her left groin wound while coughing earlier today.
33353	She was doing well until this morning when she coughed and immediately noted that her left pant leg was soaked with blood from the left groin down the left leg.
33354	When she took off her pants there was no active bleeding from the wound and she denies any light-headedness or dizziness.
33355	There has been no further bleeding from the wound and she is otherwise without complaints.

33376	This likely represents extrusion of a postoperative hematoma.
33377	There is currently no evidence of active bleeding from the wound.
33378	A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home.
33379	She will follow up with Dr. Ishikawa at her scheduled postop visit.
33380	Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
33381	D/W Dr. Casey Iacono (Surgery Fellow), who agrees with assessment and plan.

33391	Dear Dr. Schmidt:
33392	Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.
33393	As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.
33394	She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.
33395	She has done well since the procedure.
33396	She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.
33397	She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.
33398	She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.
33399	On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.
33400	She is alert and oriented x3.
33401	She appears grossly neurologically intact.
33402	Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.
33403	Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.
33404	This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.
33405	It remains superficial.
33406	She has no other ischemic skin changes noted.
33407	I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.
33408	She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.
33409	She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.
33410	I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.
33411	She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.
33412	She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen.
33413	If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.

33425	On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.
33426	However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.
33427	On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.
33428	She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.
33429	She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.

33498	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
33499	52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.
33500	On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.
33501	In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.
33502	The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.
33503	- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin
33504	- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan
33505	- NPO from midnight, pepcid

33534	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.
33535	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic
33536	vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial
33537	bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity
33538	cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.
33539	She was recently treated
33540	at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,
33541	had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex.
33542	She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48
33543	hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.
33544	She has
33545	also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not
33546	had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or
33547	other symptomatology.
33548	She has also not noticed any urinary
33549	symptoms of frequency.
33550	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,
33551	hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
33552	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and
33553	fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in
33554	2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.
33555	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies
33556	tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.
33557	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,
33558	respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on
33559	room air.
33560	General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no
33561	apparent distress.
33562	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation
33563	bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
33564	Cardiovascular: 
33565	Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
33566	GI:  The
33567	abdomen is soft.
33568	The patient does have insulin pump in place,
33569	but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.
33570	Skin is warm,
33571	dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,
33572	which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the
33573	right lower extremity.
33574	This erythema stops at the ankle and does
33575	not extend up above the knee.
33576	The patient also has an open
33577	chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot
33578	as well.
33579	There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:
33580	 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased
33581	sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.
33582	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated
33583	by me and the resident.
33584	I confirm that I have seen and evaluated
33585	the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the
33586	patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and
33587	disposition with the patient as well as the resident.
33588	The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.
33589	CBC showed white
33590	count of 14 with shift.
33591	LFTs were within normal limits.
33592	X-ray
33593	of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray
33594	of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.
33595	Given the
33596	erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this
33597	vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of
33598	vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed
33599	outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting
33600	her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.
33601	The patient's
33602	erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be
33603	extremely atypical for a DVT.
33604	We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is
33605	followed closely by Surgery and this notification was
33606	made at 8:30 p.m.
33607	Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point
33608	we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she
33609	does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she
33610	needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on
33611	maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the
33612	hospital.
33613	DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
33614	CONDITION:  Stable.
33615	DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

33686	NAME: Marsh, Carl
33687	MRN: 99579205
33688	Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy
33689	Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney
33690	Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T
33691	Estimated dry weight: 61 kg
33692	Dialysis access: left AVF
33693	Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night
33694	HPI: 
33695	74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.
33696	The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.
33697	The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.
33698	Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.
33699	He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.
33700	It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.
33701	The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.
33702	He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).
33703	It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.
33704	He has been symptom-free since that time.
33705	He reports no other new events.
33706	He denies any new medications.
33707	Past Medical History:

33799	While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.

34132	the resident who saw the patient primarily.
34133	I have seen and
34134	examined the patient personally, reviewed the written

34140	Clinic.
34141	According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does
34142	not have very much past medical history, but when he gets
34143	infected, he gets confused.
34144	He presents today with confusion.
34145	His visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness
34146	and fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as
34147	he has been when he has been ill in the past.
34148	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes
34149	type 2.
34150	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker.

34155	Risperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.
34156	ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
34157	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian
34158	gentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time.
34159	He knows
34160	place and name.
34161	His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,
34162	blood pressure is 121/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room
34163	air, and his temperature is 101.5.
34164	He had left lower lobe
34165	crackles in his lung exam.
34166	The remainder of his physical exam

34180	creatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the
34181	Emergency Department as a bolus.
34182	Given that pneumonia and
34183	urinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to

34289	2.
34290	Diabetes.

34292	but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it.
34293	creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
34294	elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment.
34295	We will start her on 
34296	Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d.
34297	I expect we will need to increase this and if 
34298	she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week.
34299	I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
34300	or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication.
34301	I suggested 
34302	she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
34303	eating.
34304	I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry.
34305	She also 
34306	requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with 
34307	592 Kristina Street                                Xia, Jean

34524	Dictated at: 05/06/2092 by EDWARD XAYASANE, M.D.
34525	CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right leg pain and difficulty walking.
34526	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wilhelm is a 68-year-old right-handed female who has had a three-week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking.
34527	She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot.
34528	She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee.
34529	She states that it went away at that time.
34530	The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.
34531	An MRI was ordered.
34532	Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better.
34533	She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain.
34534	She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle.
34535	She does not have any numbness or tingling.
34536	She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner.
34537	Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.
34538	Therapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy.
34539	She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis.
34540	Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge.
34541	Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay.
34542	She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.

34559	She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed.
34560	She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.
34561	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time.
34562	On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits.
34563	Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees.
34564	Side-bending was unremarkable.
34565	On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left.
34566	Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.
34567	Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left.
34568	On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left.
34569	Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles.
34570	Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left.
34571	Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.
34572	IMPRESSION:  
34573	1.
34574	Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.
34575	2.
34576	Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.
34577	RECOMMENDATIONS:  
34578	Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.
34579	Physical therapy after her injection.
34580	3.
34581	Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.
34582	4.
34583	Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.
34584	The patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.

34685	Prominent systolic murmur(s?).
34686	Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
34687	There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.
34688	7.
34689	Minimally elevated troponins.
34690	Uncertain significance.
34691	8.
34692	Anemia, mildly microcytic.
34693	9.
34694	Elevated LDH.
34695	10.
34696	Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.
34697	11.
34698	History of hypertension.
34699	Discussion:
34700	Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.
34701	She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.
34702	The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.
34703	Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.
34704	She should not receive diuretics at present.
34705	Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.
34706	I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.
34707	The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.
34708	We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.
34709	The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.
34710	Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.
34711	Suggest:
34712	Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.
34713	IV normal saline.
34714	May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.
34715	Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.
34716	Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.
34717	Agree with check echocardiogram.
34718	We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.
34719	Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

34734	ID/CC: no appetite, acute renal failure
34735	HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97.
34736	At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss.
34737	In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes.
34738	The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma.
34739	Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV.
34740	The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.
34741	Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process.
34742	Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population.
34743	Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.
34744	The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced.
34745	On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed.
34746	Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia.
34747	Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization.
34748	Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.
34749	She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth.
34750	She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family.
34751	She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection.
34752	Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes.
34753	She has not had a bowel movement for several days.
34754	She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.
34755	In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization.
34756	She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household.
34757	She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally.
34758	She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game.
34759	She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
34760	ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%.
34761	She was given IVF and labs were drawn.

34867	73F h/o newly dx HOCM, chronic systemic LAD, fatigue, and weight loss concerning for sarcoid vs. PBC vs. neoplasm, presenting with acute renal failure in setting of little PO intake and likely hypercalcemia.
34868	Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression.
34869	This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

34899	HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.
34900	She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.
34901	This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.
34902	She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.
34903	The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.
34904	The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.

35042	RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
35043	CXR (12/14):     Lines/tubes:  Interval placement of left-sided PICC line the tip of the PICC line does not cross midline there is a nasogastric tube with the tip below the diaphragm
35044	     Lungs:  There is a persistent opacity in the left mid hemithorax
35045	     Pleura:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
35046	Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are normal.
35047	CT Abd (12/14):     LOWER THORAX: There been interval resolution of the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions.
35048	There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases.
35049	HEPATOBILIARY: No focal hepatic lesions.
35050	No biliary ductal dilatation.
35051	There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder.
35052	SPLEEN: No splenomegaly.
35053	PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.
35054	ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
35055	KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions.
35056	Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
35057	PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place.
35058	There is a fibroid uterus.
35059	PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.
35060	There is trace free fluid.
35061	LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
35062	VESSELS: There are scattered vascular calcifications.
35063	An IVC filter is in place.
35064	GI TRACT: There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.
35065	There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.
35066	There has been a prior  a prior colostomy.
35067	There is diverticulosis.
35068	BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
35069	IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.
35070	Alternately, this could reflect ileus.
35071	Close clinical follow up advised.
35072	EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL
35073	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
35074	Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  
35075	SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.
35076	Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.
35077	Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.
35078	Appreciate surgery input
35079	NGT to low wall suction
35080	NPO except meds for bowel rest
35081	Serial abdominal exams
35082	Check colostomy output guaiac
35083	Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.
35084	With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.
35085	Continue IVF while NPO
35086	Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
35087	Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.
35088	She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
35089	She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.
35090	Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.
35091	Transfuse 1U PRBCs
35092	Check colostomy guaiac
35093	Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
35094	Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.
35095	She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.
35096	She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.
35097	Hold Coumadin for now
35098	Follow up INR, goal 2-3
35099	HOCM/HTN: 
35100	Continue lopressor, verapamil
35101	Sarcoid:
35102	Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
35103	PAF
35104	Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio
35105	F/E/N:  NPO
35106	PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen

35117	Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23).
35118	She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli.
35119	She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX.
35120	Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection.
35121	Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility.
35122	Patient has no complaints.
35123	Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills.
35124	However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED.

35220	A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks.
35221	1.
35222	Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear.
35223	It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection.
35224	At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI.
35225	Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
35226	In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression.
35227	- F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures
35228	                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 
35229	                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)
35230	- Culture if spikes
35231	                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 
35232	                 improve
35233	2.
35234	Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past.
35235	During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy.
35236	GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy.
35237	It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive.
35238	- Type and screen
35239	                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement
35240	                - Check post-transfusion Hct 
35241	3.
35242	HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents
35243	                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB
35244	                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)
35245	4.
35246	Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR.
35247	Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding.
35248	As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her.
35249	- Monitor daily INRs
35250	                - Hold warfarin overnight
35251	5.
35252	Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2).

35298	He is also very
35299	concerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is
35300	not caring for herself well at home.
35301	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and
35302	a prior stroke.
35303	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has also had knee surgery.
35304	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per
35305	the written note.
35306	The patient was counseled regarding smoking
35307	cessation.
35308	MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.
35309	ALLERGIES:  None.
35310	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute
35311	distress.
35312	Vital signs are within normal limits as documented.
35313	For full physical exam findings, please see the resident's
35314	written note.
35315	Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,
35316	rectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as
35317	documented.
35318	Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in
35319	the groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to
35320	obesity.
35321	Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.
35322	Range
35323	of motion is full.
35324	Strength and tone is normal.
35325	The patient
35326	does have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing
35327	her back pain.
35328	Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but
35329	is oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic
35330	deficit in either motor or sensory distribution.
35331	She does,
35332	however, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.
35333	LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.
35334	BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,
35335	respectively.
35336	Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.
35337	Urinalysis is
35338	positive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and
35339	2+ bacteria.
35340	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient
35341	is her inability to care for self at home.
35342	It is apparent that
35343	her son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient
35344	on physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am
35345	concerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying
35346	neurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from
35347	thriving at home.
35348	Psychiatry initially was consulted.
35349	Their
35350	impression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem
35351	that needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a
35352	specific providers within the next 2 weeks.
35353	The patient was
35354	treated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.
35355	Care
35356	coordinator and social services were consulted.
35357	The patient will
35358	have a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary
35359	care services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and
35360	will likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication
35361	compliance and other ADLs.
35362	******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

36290	Patient Name:      Leon
36291	MRN:                      43634211
36292	Date:                      0021
36293	Consult reason:  
36294	?abnormal gait
36295	HPI:  53RHM who going to bed Wednesday was in usoh, but Thursday 2:30AM awoke w/ terrible HA, so came to ED; got CT head and LP, both negative for blood.
36296	However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s.
36297	I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged.
36298	Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight.
36299	He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone.
36300	However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait.
36301	An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI.
36302	Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx.
36303	Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints.
36304	He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone.
36305	VS in ED tonight: BP 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA
36306	Blood glucose not measured tonight.
36307	ROS: 
36308	Negative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait.
36309	General review of systems negative for:  fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).
36310	MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)
36311	ALL: nkda
36312	PMH: 
36313	-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night
36314	-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)
36315	SH: denies t/e/d, works as &#8220;Pipefitter&#8221;
36316	FH: HTN, DM
36317	Neurologic Examination: 
36318	MS: unpleasant, uncooperative w/ history, angry about being in the ED still
36319	AOx3, appropriately interactive and conversational.
36320	Normal affect.
36321	Speech is fluent with intact comprehension and repetition, no paraphasic errors.
36322	Concentration and attention intact.

36357	Able to walk on toes and heels.
36358	Some difficulty w/ tandem walk.
36359	Negative Romberg.
36360	A/P:  53RHM w/ HTN urgency yesterday, newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in 300-400s yesterday, who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative w/u for SAH, now back again for same HA, which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP (current BP 150s) and w/ medications.
36361	Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems.
36362	Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education.
36363	In any case, I find no acute neurological issues.
36364	Recs: 
36365	-BP management
36366	-DM management.
36367	Thanks for this interesting consult.
36368	Case/plan discussed w/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone, Dr. Ivan Guy.

36370	Keith Gilbert, MD, PhD, 
36371	Neurology resident PGY3
36372	Addendum: 
36373	He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 
36374	A note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.
36375	He is doing much better today.
36376	He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;

36481	Reason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees
36482	HPI:
36483	77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.
36484	At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.
36485	This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.
36486	In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.
36487	Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.
36488	Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.
36489	She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).

36577	She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.
36578	Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.
36579	This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).
36580	Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.
36581	However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.

36585	- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
36586	- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)
36587	Procedure: R knee aspiration
36588	Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent.
36589	The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach.
36590	1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella.
36591	A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn.
36592	A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.
36593	Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.
36594	Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

36930	Reason for Visit
36931	Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.
36932	We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.
36933	He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.
36934	He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.
36935	Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.
36936	He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.
36937	His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.
36938	I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.
36939	He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.
36940	He is worried about his remaining vision.
36941	He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.
36942	She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.
36943	He also is having trouble sleeping.
36944	He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.
36945	He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.
36946	He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

37130	"       	         "
37131	EKG (3/01/88): NSR at 84 bpm w/ RBBB, LAHB, q waves in V3-4, no ST segment changes
37132	Radiology: 
37133	CXR (2/27/88): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
37134	CT Brain (2/27/88): 
37135	Atherosclerotic disease, extensive microangiopathic changes and chronic appearing lacunar infarcts, as described.
37136	No specific evidence of acute infarction, although DW-MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.
37137	No intracranial hemorrhage.
37138	Assessment: 76yo M w/ history of DM, HTN, and h/o of CVA presents with AMS and increasing falls in setting of influenza.
37139	PLAN:   
37140	Delirium:  Pt's waxing and waning mental status likely secondary from his underlying infectious processes - influenza and UTI.
37141	a.
37142	Correct hyponatremia
37143	b.
37144	Monitor mental status as infection is treated
37145	Falls:  Pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology.
37146	Pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on MMSE), possible diabetic neuropathy, and 
37147	Check orthostatic vital signs
37148	Check RPR/B12
37149	"c.	Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate"
37150	Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Pt clinically appears hypovolemic.
37151	A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.
37152	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs
37153	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).
37154	Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.
37155	A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.
37156	Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

37262	12/09/95
37263	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
37264	including subacute weight loss.
37265	IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
37266	75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.
37267	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
37268	severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.
37269	She
37270	has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation.
37271	Past right carotid endarterectomy.
37272	In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
37273	cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
37274	pneumonia.
37275	She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
37276	artery and left common carotid artery.
37277	She had subsequent
37278	episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
37279	with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.
37280	She is followed closely by
37281	Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
37282	interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.
37283	During her most recent hospitalization she had some
37284	confusion which was attributed to low sodium.
37285	This was
37286	felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
37287	SIADH.
37288	This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
37289	boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
37290	Lasix.
37291	No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
37292	Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
37293	Baseline weight 170 pounds.
37294	Weight in early September, 167
37295	pounds.
37296	Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.
37297	"Weight <PHI TYPE=""DATE"">November "
37298	28th</PHI>, 141 pounds.
37299	Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.
37300	She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
37301	revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.
37302	The
37303	G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
37304	never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
37305	Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
37306	with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
37307	swallow.
37308	Her caloric p.o.
37309	intake sounds as if it has been
37310	quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
37311	foods here and there.
37312	She is drinking two or three can of
37313	booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
37314	needs.
37315	Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
37316	(phone number 507.741.8042).
37317	Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
37318	potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
37319	1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.
37320	The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
37321	her weight has decreased.
37322	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
37323	blood per rectum within the last week.
37324	The patient's
37325	daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
37326	early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.
37327	patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
37328	visit.
37329	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
37330	1.
37331	Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above.
37332	2.
37333	Throat cancer in early 2060s.
37334	Status post XRT to the
37335	neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
37336	vertebral disease).
37337	3.
37338	Breast cancer.
37339	Details unknown.
37340	Will review at next

37342	Diabetes, type II.
37343	On glyburide.
37344	Further details
37345	unknown.

37349	Hypertension.
37350	Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
37351	170.
37352	7.
37353	Hypothyroidism.
37354	Recent TSH normal.
37355	8.
37356	Glaucoma.
37357	9.
37358	Anxiety.
37359	Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
37360	basis.
37361	This was apparently a large factor during her recent
37362	hospitalizations.

37407	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
37408	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.
37409	Her
37410	daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.
37411	Another daughter is staying with the
37412	patient full-time.
37413	Visiting nurse is involved.
37414	Previous to
37415	the last few months, the patient was fairly independent.
37416	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
37417	GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
37418	on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
37419	and carefully.
37420	Has a cane, but does not always use it.
37421	VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
37422	and 171/74 on repeat.
37423	Pulse 80.
37424	Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
37425	clothed.
37426	ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.
37427	Soft, nontender and
37428	nondistended.
37429	No hepatosplenomegaly.
37430	No masses.
37431	G-tube is
37432	flushed with water, and flushes easily.
37433	G-tube site itself
37434	is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.
37435	LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
37436	HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
37437	No murmurs.
37438	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
37439	Weight loss.
37440	Probably due to poor caloric intake.
37441	This
37442	is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
37443	progressively cachectic and weak.
37444	This is probably
37445	attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia.
37446	She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
37447	Tuesday.
37448	I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
37449	that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
37450	of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate.
37451	She should continue to take p.o.
37452	foods as tolerated, but she
37453	needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
37454	since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.
37455	Will try Glucerna
37456	because of her diabetes history.
37457	The patient's daughter and
37458	the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
37459	Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
37460	Nutrition Clinic in two days.
37461	Cerebrovascular disease.
37462	Followed closely by Neurology.
37463	No acute change in neuro status today.
37464	Will continue
37465	Coumadin.
37466	Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
37467	this.
37468	Recent INR 1.4.
37469	Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
37470	IM nurse.
37471	I need to review these records more closely, and
37472	try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.
37473	In
37474	the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently.
37475	Diabetes.
37476	Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
37477	to 350 range.
37478	Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
37479	range over the past few days.
37480	Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
37481	Finger-sticks three to four times daily.
37482	Further
37483	adjustments PRN.
37484	Our current goal is simply to maintain her
37485	sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.
37486	Once her
37487	dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
37488	tighter control.
37489	Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
37490	troubles with p.o.
37491	intake.
37492	Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.
37493	Daughter
37494	will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
37495	take it from there.
37496	Constipation.
37497	Continue Colace.
37498	Add Dulcolax PRN.
37499	Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.
37500	If she does
37501	have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
37502	her ability to eat successfully.
37503	Currently in reasonable control.
37504	Goal BP
37505	140 to 170, systolic.
37506	Initial severe hypertension this
37507	visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
37508	for her.
37509	Follow-up at next visit.
37510	Followed by Psychiatry.
37511	Extensive reassurance
37512	given today to the patient.
37513	She is very concerned about her
37514	weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
37515	take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion.
37516	Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd
37517	watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
37518	Multiple other issues.
37519	To be addressed at further
37520	visits.
37521	Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
37522	her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
37523	Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

37537	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
37538	reevaluate Coumadin.
37539	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
37540	77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
37541	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.
37542	Last
37543	week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
37544	It was a very very windy day.
37545	Afterwards she was outside and a
37546	huge gust of wind knocked her over.
37547	Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
37548	her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
37549	the wind blew.
37550	There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
37551	of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode.
37552	She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
37553	left eyebrow.
37554	She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
37555	CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
37556	lateral edge of her left eyebrow.
37557	She had films of her wrist and
37558	hips both of which were fine.
37559	She has bruising in these areas.
37560	Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
37561	back to normal.
37562	She had marked hypertension up to 250.
37563	She was treated with
37564	hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
37565	some hematuria.
37566	Her blood pressure at home since then has been
37567	180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.
37568	She
37569	is not on a beta-blocker currently.
37570	She has not had any episodes
37571	of chest pain.
37572	She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.
37573	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o.
37574	b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
37575	q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
37576	lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
37577	p.r.n., levothyroxine
37578	100 mg p.o.
37579	q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.
37580	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas.
37581	She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.
37582	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
37583	weight 148 pounds.
37584	GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
37585	HEENT: PERRL.
37586	Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
37587	eyebrow is easily removed.
37588	No evidence of any infection.
37589	Her
37590	left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
37591	shoulder.
37592	Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
37593	bony step-offs.
37594	She walks well with no pain in her left hip.
37595	There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
37596	bursa.
37597	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
37598	bruising but no more serious complications.
37599	Fortunately she did
37600	not have intracranial bleeding.
37601	I am not sure why her blood
37602	pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
37603	falls verses independent causes.
37604	Given that the high blood
37605	pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
37606	q.d.,
37607	and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
37608	see how well this is working.
37609	Goal BP 140-160 systolic.
37610	urine was checked today.
37611	Hematuria has resolved.
37612	She has 2+
37613	proteinuria.
37614	I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
37615	her hypertension.
37616	We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
37617	and benefits of Coumadin therapy.
37618	Although she is at risk for
37619	falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
37620	Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke.
37621	She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
37622	that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke.
37623	I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
37624	hemorrhage and its consequences.
37625	I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
37626	month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
37627	working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
37628	increased risk for falls.
37629	It seems to me that she is in a gray
37630	area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
37631	for Coumadin for her.
37632	She feels very strongly that she wishes to
37633	continue.
37634	This was discussed in detail with her and her
37635	daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.
37636	I
37637	encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
37638	strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall.
37639	More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
37640	counseling and education.

37649	"Betty has been doing ""okay"" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability."
37650	She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.
37651	Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.
37652	She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.
37653	She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.

37662	9/29/95:  >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.
37663	>90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.
37664	70-75% LICA.
37665	The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.
37666	Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse.
37667	>50% in B ECAs.
37668	9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.
37669	Rbif without significant stenosis.
37670	RVA dominant.
37671	Ultrasound:

37675	Right vertebral irregular/stenotic.
37676	LCCA, bifurcation, LICA with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-LCCA, >80%.
37677	Functional Cerebrovascular Studies:
37678	Diamox SPECT 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.
37679	Vascular Procedures:

37712	"  	  	  	  	  	"
37713	Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.
37714	She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.
37715	Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.
37716	Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.
37717	Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.
37718	This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.
37719	Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.
37720	Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.
37721	She is unable to tandem gait.
37722	Impression:
37723	Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
37724	She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.
37725	Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.
37726	My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.
37727	I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.
37728	I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.
37729	I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.
37730	I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.
37731	I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.
37732	Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.
37733	I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.
37734	This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.
37735	While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

38084	DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
38085	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
38086	The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
38087	In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
38088	There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
38089	This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.
38090	The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
38091	She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.
38092	The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
38093	She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
38094	The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
38095	Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
38096	Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.
38097	There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
38098	On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.
38099	MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
38100	The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
38101	MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
38102	Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
38103	Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
38104	It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
38105	Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
38106	Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
38107	There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
38108	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
38109	The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
38110	There are no medication allergies reported.
38111	PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.
38112	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.
38113	Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.
38114	She uses alcohol occasionally.
38115	She has a 12th grade education.
38116	She lives alone and is a widow.
38117	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.
38118	The patient is overweight.
38119	Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
38120	Weight is 217 pounds.
38121	Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.
38122	Poor neck posture is noted.
38123	Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
38124	Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.
38125	Temporal arteries are normal.
38126	Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
38127	Romberg is negative.
38128	Tandem gait is normal.
38129	The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
38130	There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
38131	This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
38132	There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
38133	NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.
38134	Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.
38135	Extraocular movements are full.
38136	Visual fields are intact.
38137	There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.
38138	Hearing is intact.
38139	Oropharynx is normal.
38140	Palate elevates well.
38141	Tongue is midline.
38142	Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
38143	Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
38144	There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
38145	Coordination testing today seemed intact.
38146	Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
38147	Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.
38148	Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.
38149	IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.
38150	Comment.
38151	I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
38152	I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
38153	Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
38154	In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
38155	It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
38156	PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
38157	She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
38158	We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
38159	We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
38160	It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.
38161	For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
38162	I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
38163	She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
38164	We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

39401	78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.
39402	Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.
39403	Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.
39404	ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis

40117	RE:  MCKEE, Norma 
40118	MR#: 6987776 
40119	DOB:  7/7/75 
40120	Dear Robert, 
40121	Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee, a 51-year-old female patient with the history of seizure disorder, hypertension, borderline diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms, and depressive disorder, who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent polysomnographic abnormalities.
40122	"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As you already know, Ms. Mckee describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses, and describes a ""restless sleep"", but only relatively recently (over the last five months, particularly after 12/26 of last year)."
40123	She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.
40124	"She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves ""sleeping around the clock"" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration."
40125	The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.
40126	"She states that she is so tired that she can ""fall asleep right after breakfast""."
40127	She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.
40128	Ms. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy.
40129	She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m.
40130	and three tablets po q.h.s.
40131	"While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of ""diffuse"" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below)."
40132	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Celexa, Zestril, Prilosec, carbamazepine (200 mg tablets, four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night), clonazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, Premarin, tetracycline and klor-con.
40133	ALLERGIES:  No adverse drug allergies reported.
40134	SLEEP HISTORY:  Sleep onset intended for 11:00 p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.  She describes one to two early morning awakenings, with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance.
40135	Sleep offset initially occurs at 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and sometimes as late as 10:00 a.m.
40136	The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration (up to four hours).
40137	The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness, will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep.
40138	Patient may sleep until 3:00 p.m. on certain given afternoons.
40139	"The patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as ""restless"" sleep."
40140	She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder.
40141	She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
40142	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
40143	1.
40144	Seizure disorder.
40145	2.
40146	Hypertension.
40147	3.
40148	Borderline diabetes.
40149	4.
40150	Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
40151	5.
40152	Depressive disorder.
40153	6.
40154	Panic related symptoms.
40155	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies active tobacco use.
40156	She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease.
40157	She averages two cups of tea per day.
40158	While describing an overweight status, she has increased her weight by 10-20 pounds over the past four years.
40159	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies.
40160	Speech is clear and fluent.
40161	Receptive language functioning essentially intact.
40162	No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
40163	No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted.
40164	No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
40165	The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.
40166	No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
40167	"No acute evidence of ""microsleeps"" are noted."
40168	On HEENT examination, there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal apeture, with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula, as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size.
40169	Vital signs include a blood pressure of 144/88 (seated, left arm) and a heart rate of 88, with a respiratory rate of 14.
40170	IMPRESSION:  
40171	Hypersomnia (780.54):  Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals.
40172	Other diagnostic possibilities include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy (although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy).
40173	Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (780.53):  Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of 26 per hour as noted during a recent 3/26/27 sleep study with associated O2 desaturations down to 76 percent.
40174	Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted.
40175	Seizure disorder:  Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy.
40176	PLAN:  
40177	"Suggest regular home CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure)."
40178	Pending clinical response, will reassess the patient's level of alertness, decrease amount of early morning awakenings, and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in 12-14 weeks times.
40179	In addition, patient is advised to continue efforts at weight reduction, use of an oro-dental, and/or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms.
40180	Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m.
40181	until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made.
40182	Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in 12-14 weeks time.
40183	Once again, thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee.
40184	I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.

40187	Department of Sleep Studies 
40188	ADDENDUM:  Sleep study results (3/26/27):  
40189	Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive (82) and partially obstructive apneas (63) during supine sleep, as well as intermittent hypopneas (19) and nocturnal hypoventilations, intermittent snore arousals (4) and episodes of moderate snoring (respiratory disturbance index = 26 per hour) with associated arousals and O2 desaturations down to 76%.
40190	Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved, the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented.
40191	"CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances, help consolidate sleep, as well as improve O2 saturations (i.e., to 96% and above, even during REM supine sleep) and overall sleep stage architecture."
40192	"Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep, activated during both ""light"" non-REM, as well as stage REM sleep (index = 8 per hour) with infrequent limb associated arousals (index = 1 per hour) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep (the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition)."
40193	Cardiac rates typically ranged between 72-87 beats per minute; average 80 beats per minute.
40194	"EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of ""diffuse"" spike-wave discharges were evident during light sleep, without associated clinical accompaniment."
40195	"Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre-CPAP conditions, but with prominent ""slow wave and REM rebounds"" subsequently noted with CPAP administration; i.e., accounting for more than 41% and more than 31% of the CPAP sleep times, respectively."

40445	Present Illness:  
40446	Ms. Mckee thinks that she will be discharged today.
40447	If so, we must be confident that she is able to draw up and inject insulin reliably.
40448	She will also needs prescriptions for metformin, 
40449	insulin syringes (give her 1 cc syringes), NPH and Regular insulins.
40450	She apparently has glucose testing material at home.
40451	Will start with the following regimen, in addition to metformin 500 mg bid.
40452	She will follow up with her PCP, 
40453	Dr. Robert Xenakis.

40464	Before Supper:
40465	&#183;         This is only an initial set of guidelines.
40466	The doses will have to be adjusted based on experience, diet, exercise, and illness.
40467	&#183;         Goal is to have blood sugars before meals in the 90-130 range and blood sugars at bedtime in the 110-140 range.
40468	&#183;         Check blood sugars initially before meals and at bedtime each day.
40469	Record the times, blood sugars, insulin doses and all food on the sheets provided and bring these sheets to your medical appointments.
40470	&#183;         Call Dr. Xenakis&#8217;s office for any blood sugars under 70, or any symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).
40471	&#183;         Also call if blood sugars are often over 180.

40576	status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
40577	lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
40578	popliteal artery on the left.
40579	The patient presents now for
40580	"further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms""."
40581	The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
40582	there are about equivalent in nature.
40583	He has very minimal low
40584	back pain.
40585	He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
40586	be associated with some abnormal gait.
40587	He states on a bad day
40588	its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
40589	high as 8-9/10.
40590	The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
40591	by things like walking.
40592	He can walk less than one block at which
40593	point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
40594	shuffling and occasionally falling.
40595	When he is having severe
40596	symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.
40597	He denies any bowel or
40598	bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
40599	UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
40600	He has very
40601	little back pain associated with his symptomatology.
40602	He has had
40603	no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.
40604	He
40605	describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
40606	states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
40607	Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.
40608	His weight is
40609	steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.
40610	doesn't smoke and drinks socially.
40611	Quit smoking 33 years ago.
40612	He does not think he will ever be pain free.
40613	Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
40614	and he has been for the past couple of years.
40615	He has difficulty
40616	with sleep.
40617	He has a balance problem and also has benign
40618	prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
40619	for this he takes Cardura.
40620	He has a history of high blood
40621	pressure.
40622	Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.
40623	No
40624	respiratory malfunction.
40625	"He has had surgery for something ""in"
40626	"his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery."
40627	He is on Plavix and
40628	aspirin.
40629	Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
40630	appearing male.
40631	He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
40632	side his T band seems to be slightly weak.
40633	Single toe raises
40634	show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.
40635	He has no
40636	tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.
40637	He has
40638	negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.
40639	Forward flexion allows him
40640	to get to the patella.
40641	Extension is pain free and passive
40642	hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.
40643	Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.
40644	Sensory is
40645	symmetric.
40646	He has negative straight leg raises.
40647	palpable pulses.
40648	He is hairless in his lower extremities.
40649	had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
40650	"that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality""."
40651	He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
40652	and for his gastroesophageal reflux.
40653	Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
40654	with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
40655	his iliac artery on the right.
40656	CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
40657	hypertrophy.
40658	At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
40659	disk disease.
40660	I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
40661	see me after that.
40662	Thanks for the referral.

40761	   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.
40762	Interval History:
40763	   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
40764	His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.
40765	Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.
40766	He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.
40767	Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.
40768	He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.
40769	The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.
40770	The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.
40771	Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.
40772	The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.
40773	His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.
40774	It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.
40775	At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.
40776	Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.
40777	The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.
40778	Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.
40779	Past medical history:
40780	   Diabetes, onset in 2135.
40781	Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.
40782	The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.
40783	MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.
40784	Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.
40785	Neuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI.
40786	Cervical spondylosis.
40787	Tracheal tumor resection in 2128 performed via a suprasternal incision.
40788	Hypertension.
40789	Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2153 during one of his peripheral angiograms.
40790	Current Medications:

40814	He has three children.
40815	Nondrinker.
40816	He smoked until 30 years ago.
40817	Review of systems:
40818	   Detailed review of systems was carried out.
40819	It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.
40820	He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.
40821	He has nocturia.
40822	He wears dentures.
40823	No significant weight loss or anorexia.
40824	No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.
40825	He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.
40826	Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.
40827	Physical examination:
40828	-Pulse:   68 and regular.
40829	Afebrile
40830	-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.
40831	Equal bilaterally
40832	-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.
40833	Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance
40834	-Skin:   Without rashes
40835	-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils
40836	-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.
40837	No JVD
40838	-Chest:   Clear
40839	-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs
40840	-Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender.
40841	Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta.
40842	May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation
40843	-Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides.
40844	Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.
40845	Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.
40846	Good capillary refill
40847	-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.
40848	His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.
40849	He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.
40850	Otherwise, no focal deficits
40851	Procedures:
40852	Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.
40853	92 and 1.03, respectively.
40854	The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.
40855	I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.
40856	EKG:
40857	    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.
40858	There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.
40859	Other Data:
40860	   DOB: 11/25/2083.
40861	Assessment and plan:
40862	   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.
40863	Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.
40864	Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.
40865	On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.
40866	His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.
40867	I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.
40868	1.
40869	As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.
40870	Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.
40871	2.
40872	Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.
40873	PLAN: 
40874	Formal exercise ABIs.
40875	Obtain angiographic studies from AC.

40933	pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.
40934	The orthostatic change was
40935	symptomatic.
40936	He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
40937	6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when

40947	being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.
40948	Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
40949	upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
40950	1 in the left lower extremity,.
40951	The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal):

40969	Assessment:  
40970	  1.
40971	Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
40972	It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
40973	pressure.
40974	I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH.
40975	In addition Dr
40976	Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his

41031	His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities.
41032	His sx's sound like left-sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about  systemic demyelinating conditions.
41033	Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. Conley.
41034	[08/28/70]
41035	TSH and B12 levels were normal.

41191	CC:  Diarrhea
41192	HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.
41193	In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.
41194	After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.
41195	Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.
41196	Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.
41197	He received 21 days of flagyl.
41198	After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.
41199	Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.
41200	He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.
41201	One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.
41202	At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.
41203	Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.
41204	He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.
41205	He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness.

41365	Dear Harry and Yair:
41366	My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
41367	As you know, she is just 52 years of age.
41368	Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.
41369	She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
41370	She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
41371	She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
41372	On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.
41373	This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.
41374	In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
41375	There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
41376	She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
41377	By last spring, i.e.
41378	a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
41379	She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
41380	Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
41381	Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.
41382	Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???
41383	length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
41384	Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
41385	She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
41386	She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
41387	On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.
41388	Pulse was 70 and regular.
41389	Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
41390	She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.
41391	There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
41392	She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
41393	This is of course a very unhappy situation.
41394	Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
41395	However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
41396	I would suggest the following.
41397	Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.
41398	Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
41399	She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
41400	If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
41401	I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
41402	My thanks once again.
41403	With every best wish.
41404	Sincerely,
41405	Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

41589	cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg
41590	HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.
41591	Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.
41592	Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.
41593	She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.
41594	She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.
41595	She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.
41596	Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.
41597	She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.
41598	She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).
41599	She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).
41600	She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

41763	Record date: 2063-12-13
41764	NAME:     Umphrey, Tammy 
41765	MRN:       0942207
41766	The patient is here as a walk-in.
41767	Her spouse is present.
41768	Patient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home.
41769	Says that she seems
41770	to have lost her balance while opening a door at home.
41771	Denies prodromal
41772	symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations.
41773	There was no
41774	loss of consciousness.
41775	Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma
41776	to the head.
41777	Had a negative CT of her head and had an x-ray of her pelvis, as she
41778	complained of some hip pain.
41779	Both studies were negative.
41780	Patient was then sent
41781	home with Roxicet.
41782	Patient was seen in the walk-in clinic at CPI yesterday, after
41783	noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing.
41784	Patient was immediately
41785	told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with
41786	Zantac and Claritin.
41787	Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue
41788	swelling.
41789	She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear
41790	reasons and wants to stop it.
41791	Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted
41792	since her fall on Monday.
41793	Did not have an x-ray of the area.
41794	Says it is very painful
41795	to sit.
41796	Roxicet was not helping.
41797	She is off her Ultram as well.
41798	PHYSICAL EXAM:  WD/overweight female in NAD.
41799	Vital signs as per LMR,
41800	WNL.
41801	Weight 213 pounds.
41802	Lungs - clear bilateral breath sounds.
41803	Cor - RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3
41804	noted.
41805	Back - slightly bent gait.
41806	Tenderness over lower sacrum.
41807	No asymmetry or
41808	obvious deformity.
41809	X-ray of sacrum 12/13/63 - could not see fracture as per my reading.
41810	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
41811	(1)  Angioedema.
41812	Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started
41813	     only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with
41814	     angioedema.
41815	Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure
41816	     is WNL.
41817	So will follow for now.
41818	(2)  Low back pain.
41819	Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which
41820	     treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut
41821	     pillow.
41822	Patient was given a prescription for the pillow.
41823	She was told to look
41824	     out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced
41825	     any perianal numbness or incontinence.
41826	Will notify patient by phone if x-ray
41827	     shows a fracture.
41828	(3)  Depression.
41829	Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's
41830	     spouse.
41831	Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. Zeman.
41832	Advised patient to let
41833	     her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor.
41834	Will take
41835	     25 mg q.o.d.
41836	for the next week.
41837	(4)  Pain control.
41838	Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q.
41839	6 as needed.
41840	Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema.
41841	Return to clinic in approximately one month.

41847	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Falling and low back pain.
41848	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.
41849	The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.
41850	There was no obvious leg buckling.
41851	She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.
41852	Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.
41853	MEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d.
41854	without significant effect on her low back pain.
41855	Ultram q.i.d.
41856	was beneficial.
41857	Neurontin 300 q.i.d.
41858	which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.
41859	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.
41860	She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.
41861	She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.
41862	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.
41863	She has had left knee arthroscopy.
41864	She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.
41865	She has had a ten year history of diabetes.
41866	She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.
41867	MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.
41868	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
41869	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.

41871	FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.
41872	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female.
41873	Her mental state examination is normal.
41874	Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
41875	Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.
41876	Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.
41877	DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.
41878	Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.
41879	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.
41880	We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.
41881	For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.
41882	We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.
41883	The patient will return to clinic after these studies.
41884	The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.

41892	Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey
41893	MR#  0942207
41894	Date of Admission:  8/26/66
41895	Attending: Yoel Pollard
41896	PCP:  Susan Ullom
41897	CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status
41898	HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)
41899	Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.
41900	She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66.
41901	Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.
41902	She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.
41903	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed.
41904	However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.
41905	8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear.
41906	U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin.
41907	There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.
41908	Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.
41909	Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days.
41910	She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.
41911	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus.
41912	She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.
41913	PMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)
41914	1.

42020	No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.
42021	No change in ventricle size.
42022	No acute infarct; although, this is
42023	"	better assessed with MR with diffusion."
42024	Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale
42025	"	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due"
42026	"	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup."
42027	"EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals."
42028	Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam.
42029	No evidence of acute ischemia.
42030	Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.
42031	Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source.
42032	Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66.
42033	Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.
42034	-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures
42035	-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism
42036	UTI
42037	-likely UTI- tx
42038	-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source
42039	-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic
42040	-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data
42041	-change foley now
42042	-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics
42043	Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status
42044	-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
42045	If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection
42046	-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm.
42047	If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic.
42048	If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.
42049	DM
42050	-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements
42051	Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH
42052	GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary
42053	HTN-continue home medications
42054	wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer

42175	Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine
42176	693-31-18-1
42177	I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.
42178	The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.
42179	He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.
42180	In August he suffered a stroke.
42181	He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.
42182	He recalls no problem with his vision.
42183	He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.
42184	He does no know the extent of the evaluation.
42185	He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.
42186	He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.
42187	His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.
42188	He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.
42189	He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.
42190	The dizziness is worst in the morning.
42191	He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.
42192	He has DM and HTN.
42193	He is a nonsmoker.
42194	I don't have cholesterol information.
42195	There is no history of cardiac disease.
42196	There is no history of alcohol abuse.
42197	He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.
42198	He has no known allergies.
42199	He is aware of no significant family history.
42200	He is married.
42201	He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.
42202	He came to america from Honduras in 2073.
42203	He worked nights in construction until his stroke.
42204	Pulse 66, regular.
42205	BP 186/110.
42206	There are no cranial bruits.
42207	The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.
42208	The lungs are clear.
42209	The heart is regular with no murmur.
42210	The abdomen is benign.
42211	The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.
42212	He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.
42213	His fluency in his native language is probably normal.
42214	Cranial nerves are intact.
42215	There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.
42216	(He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)
42217	Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.
42218	The tone is only mildly increased.
42219	Sensation is intact.
42220	Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).
42221	The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.
42222	Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.
42223	He wears a right AFO.
42224	He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.
42225	His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.
42226	This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.
42227	He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.
42228	Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.
42229	To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.
42230	I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.
42231	He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.
42232	He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.
42233	I asked him to return here in a month to review this.
42234	Sincerely,
42235	Patrick Winn, M.D.

42599	CXR: clear
42600	CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts
42601	"CTA: pending	"
42602	"MRI/MRA:	pending"
42603	Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms.
42604	Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait.
42605	Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits.
42606	However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.
42607	Plan:   
42608	-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis
42609	Check MRI brain stroke protocol
42610	Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180
42611	Control hyperglycemia
42612	If stroke present, admit to Neurology.
42613	R/O MI

42623	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.
42624	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
42625	woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
42626	hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
42627	06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.
42628	She
42629	presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
42630	normal.
42631	Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.
42632	She was admitted to
42633	the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.
42634	Her imaging studies
42635	showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
42636	of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
42637	in addition to a left ICA occlusion.
42638	She was taken to angiogram
42639	for interventional neuroradiology.
42640	She had an angiogram.
42641	Radiology felt they were unable to access the
42642	cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
42643	admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
42644	hypertensive therapy.
42645	She remained stable anti-coagulated on
42646	heparin.
42647	During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
42648	to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
42649	be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
42650	remain anti-coagulated.
42651	She was discharged to rehab and
42652	subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.
42653	At home, she
42654	had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
42655	feeling O.K.
42656	VNA sees her once a week.
42657	At rehab, for unclear
42658	reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
42659	discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
42660	done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
42661	unaware of any such problems.
42662	She continues to get PT and
42663	occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
42664	remains poor.
42665	According to the family member and her daughter
42666	who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
42667	to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
42668	decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
42669	to communicate well with her.
42670	Since her discharge, she has not
42671	had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
42672	changes.
42673	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
42674	chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
42675	claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
42676	heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
42677	diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
42678	rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
42679	or bleeding problems.
42680	Review of neurological systems as above.
42681	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated
42682	cholesterol.
42683	MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.
42684	ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

42686	No history of tobacco or alcohol.
42687	FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.
42688	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
42689	rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.
42690	General:  Pleasant woman in
42691	no acute distress.
42692	HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
42693	anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.
42694	There is no thyromegaly.
42695	Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.
42696	Heart:  Regular rate
42697	and rhythm.
42698	Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
42699	Abdomen:  Has good
42700	bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
42701	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
42702	Skin:  No rashes
42703	or ulcers.
42704	Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
42705	interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.
42706	She is attentive.
42707	is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.
42708	She has
42709	decreased naming and decreased comprehension.
42710	She does not have
42711	any neglect or apraxia.
42712	Registration is 3/4.
42713	Short-term memory
42714	is 0/4 in 5 minutes.
42715	Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
42716	Fundi are normal.
42717	Extraocular movements are intact with
42718	nystagmus.
42719	Visual fields are full to confrontation.
42720	She has a
42721	right facial droop.
42722	Facial sensation is intact.
42723	Hearing is
42724	Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
42725	arm and leg.
42726	She has strength on the left is normal.
42727	On the
42728	right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
42729	left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.
42730	reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm.
42731	There is no ataxia on the left.
42732	Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
42733	and so conducts the right leg.
42734	Her reflexes are brisker on the
42735	right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.
42736	IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
42737	acute stroke or hemorrhage.
42738	On the CT, there was a question of a
42739	left MI cutoff.
42740	CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
42741	stenosis with minimal distal interflow.
42742	MRI of the brain showed
42743	a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
42744	the caudate basal ganglia.
42745	She has had mild to moderate chronic
42746	small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.
42747	Echo showed a normal
42748	EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.
42749	IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
42750	vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
42751	with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
42752	infarct.
42753	On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
42754	comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.
42755	It
42756	is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
42757	stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
42758	during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
42759	anti-coagulation therapy.
42760	I have asked her to get a follow up
42761	PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
42762	any contraindications to anti-coagulation.
42763	If there are no such
42764	contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.
42765	In addition,
42766	her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
42767	her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d.
42768	and to maintain a
42769	blood pressure diary.
42770	RECOMMENDATIONS:
42771	1.
42772	Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
42773	t.i.d.
42774	2.
42775	Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
42776	3.
42777	Continue risk factor modification with the management of
42778	blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
42779	4.
42780	PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
42781	stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
42782	per the PCP.
42783	5.
42784	Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
42785	training and language rehab.
42786	6.
42787	Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
42788	problems.
42789	More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
42790	and counseling.

42882	ASSESSMENT/ RECOMMENDATIONS:
42883	72 year-old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow-up.
42884	She has had a significant recovery.
42885	Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.
42886	Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them.
42887	She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well.
42888	She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this.
42889	RTC as needed.
42890	Call with questions.
42891	More than 50% of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling.
42892	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.

42977	EDVISIT^91156456^HEATH, HANNAH^03/01/72^YEAGER, CHRISTOPHER
42978	I saw this patient with Dr. Rosalia West.
42979	I confirm that I have
42980	interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's
42981	documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the
42982	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
42983	Please see the resident's note for further details.
42984	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.
42985	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female
42986	with history of prior strokes, hypertension, diabetes, and
42987	paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental
42988	status.
42989	As per report, the patient has not been acting like
42990	herself and not communicating or speaking like herself.
42991	The
42992	patient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago
42993	where she started to develop a cough as well as some chills.
42994	patient's family members state that the patient has not been out
42995	of bed and has been unwilling to eat.
42996	The patient's family
42997	members state that the patient is not acting like her usual self.
42998	The patient's family members deny noting the patient complaining
42999	of any nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.
43000	patient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the
43001	patient was starting to speak less.
43002	The patient was seen clinic
43003	and was thought to be depressed.
43004	The patient has a known history
43005	of a facial droop.
43006	The patient was incontinent of urine today.
43007	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs reveal the
43008	following:  Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per
43009	minute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144/110, and
43010	oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
43011	The patient's oxygen
43012	saturation was interpreted as borderline low.
43013	General:  No acute
43014	distress, multiple family members at bedside.
43015	HEENT:  The
43016	patient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp
43017	hematomas.
43018	Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
43019	Mucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no
43020	drooling.
43021	Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits appreciated.
43022	There was no meningismus.
43023	Respiratory:  Poor cooperation with
43024	exam.
43025	Fair aeration, no focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes, no
43026	increased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was
43027	noted.
43028	Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, tachycardic,
43029	unable to appreciate any gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
43030	GI: 
43031	Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, prior well-healed prior
43032	G-tube scar noted.
43033	Rectal exam deferred.
43034	GU exam:  The patient
43035	was incontinent of urine.
43036	Skin:  Warm and dry.
43037	No rash or
43038	lesions were noted.
43039	Back:  The patient did not have any
43040	costovertebral angle tenderness.
43041	There is no midline thoracic,
43042	lumbar, or sacral spine tenderness to palpation.
43043	Extremities: 
43044	Warm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or asymmetrical
43045	lower extremity edema was noted.
43046	There were no palpable cords.
43047	Neuro:  The patient was alert, the patient was a verbal.
43048	patient grossly moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.
43049	patient responded to touch appropriately.
43050	The patient was unable
43051	to cooperate with cranial nerve examination.
43052	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 76-year-old female
43053	with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
43054	status and urinary incontinence.
43055	Differential diagnosis at this
43056	time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.
43057	patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and
43058	as per review of prior notes.
43059	Repeat stroke is certainly on the
43060	differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a
43061	metabolic or infectious etiology.
43062	The patient will need to have
43063	a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley
43064	catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT
43065	scan.
43066	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency
43067	Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed.
43068	The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
43069	ventricular response.
43070	The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate
43071	of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid
43072	ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the
43073	lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.
43074	No definite
43075	ST segment abnormalities were noted.
43076	The patient then had a
43077	portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable
43078	chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or
43079	findings.
43080	The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and
43081	the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some
43082	right-sided edema.
43083	The patient will have this followed up with
43084	an MRI of the brain.
43085	The patient's laboratory studies were
43086	notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.
43087	The patient's
43088	lactic acid was 1.7.
43089	The patient's white blood cell count was
43090	not elevated.
43091	The patient was not anemic.
43092	urinalysis was consistent with infection.
43093	The patient's first
43094	set of cardiac markers were negative.
43095	The patient's coagulation
43096	studies were normal.
43097	The patient was treated with ceftriaxone
43098	for her urinary tract infection.
43099	The patient could possibly have
43100	urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.
43101	Urine sepsis is my
43102	leading diagnosis at this time.
43103	The patient's right-sided edema
43104	is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient
43105	will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.
43106	The patient
43107	will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.
43108	will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.
43109	The patient's blood
43110	pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient
43111	needs an intensive care unit bed.
43112	In terms the patient's atrial
43113	fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was
43114	given metoprolol IV.
43115	The patient was not given any oral
43116	medications secondary to her possible stroke.
43117	The patient was
43118	given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her
43119	elevated potassium at 5.2.
43120	PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
43121	1.
43122	Urosepsis.
43123	2.
43124	Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
43125	3.
43126	Hyponatremia.
43127	4.
43128	Hyperkalemia.
43129	DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a
43130	monitor bed.
43131	CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.

43203	Her
43204	cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with
43205	a 3/6 systolic murmur.
43206	Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and
43207	nontender.
43208	No guarding and no peritoneal signs.
43209	Her skin is
43210	remarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel.
43211	On
43212	the left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,
43213	which is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter.
43214	There is no
43215	purulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left
43216	foot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the
43217	foot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the
43218	foot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in
43219	the Emergency Department.
43220	There is no other break in the skin
43221	visualized.
43222	Her back is nontender with full range of motion.

43234	initiated.
43235	Laboratory studies were sent including blood
43236	cultures.
43237	She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and
43238	gentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery.
43239	Her feet
43240	remained elevated.
43241	She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,
43242	which showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no
43243	subcutaneous gas.
43244	Her laboratory studies are remarkable for
43245	hyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.
43246	DISPOSITION:  She is admitted to Surgery.

43259	THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY.
43260	PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE.GCC Team A Infectious Disease Consultation
43261	Patient: Mack, Rose C (06129040, 63I)
43262	ID Fellow: Amanda Qualls
43263	ID Attending: Craig Faulkner
43264	Referring Physician: Dr. Kevin Katz
43265	Date of Consult: 10/26/2092
43266	Reason for Consult: DM, chronic R and L. foot ulcerations; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, pain
43267	HPI: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer.
43268	She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM.
43269	She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals.
43270	She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics.
43271	She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa.
43272	In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting.
43273	In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA.
43274	She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening).
43275	She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge.
43276	Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting.
43277	In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely.
43278	During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations.
43279	She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically.
43280	These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92.
43281	She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds.
43282	On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively.
43283	She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft.
43284	She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously.
43285	Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past.
43286	Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot.
43287	She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement.
43288	She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias.
43289	She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.
43290	PMH:
43291	poorly controlled type I DM since age 12&#8212;complicated by diabetic retinopathy s/p bilateral vitrectomies for retinal hemorrhage, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic nephropathy (gastroparesis)&#8212;on an insulin pump
43292	chronic foot ulcerations, initially R, now L, requiring numerous antibiotic courses and operative interventions:
43293	2083: R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, poor union, subsequent fracture of the remainder of her R. metarsals
43294	chronic ulcerated callus over R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis, no improvement despite multiple courses of antibiotics
43295	12/89: I+D of R. foot ulceration&#8212;cultures grew P. aeruginosa
43296	3/90: debridement of chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting
43297	6/90: deep debridement of her 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;cultures grew MSSA
43298	2/92: calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening for equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot
43299	4/92: subsequent development of R. heel ulceration, s/p debridement of her ulceration, removal of a screw, vacuum sponge placement
43300	4/92: R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting
43301	7/92: debridement of her R. heel wound and full thickness skin graft (12 x 5cm)

43465	Assessment 
43466	T1DM - Uncontrolled.
43467	Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital.
43468	Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use.
43469	Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today.
43470	While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed.
43471	Recommendations
43472	1.
43473	Continue with insulin pump.
43474	Instructed pt that she must:
43475	       a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the 
43476	       flow sheet.
43477	b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter.
43478	c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump.
43479	RN should page HO and/or diabetes dept 
43480	       immediately for orders for SC insulin.
43481	d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff.
43482	Pt agrees to all of the above.
43483	2.
43484	Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime.
43485	Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request.
43486	Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet.
43487	3.
43488	For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140.
43489	If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes.
43490	Treat BG less than 80 with 1/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above.
43491	Do not remove insulin pump.
43492	Page 5-8112 with any concerns during the procedure.
43493	Diabetes dept will continue to monitor.
43494	Please page 5-8112 with any questions or concerns.
43495	Thank you.

43685	Lung Transplant Attending Note:
43686	I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.
43687	Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.
43688	The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.
43689	The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.
43690	Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.
43691	Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.
43692	Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.
43693	DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.
43694	Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.
43695	We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.
43696	Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.
43697	Continue maintenance medications for CF.

44110	Record date: 2120-01-20
44111	Visit Note
44112	Patient Name:  WERNER, BRIAN U                       MRN:  4097229
44113	Dictated Date:  01/20/2120                        Dictated by:  Taniya Xing, M.D.
44114	Date of Visit:  01/20/2120
44115	Bryan returns for followup of cerebrovascular disease.
44116	A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119.
44117	A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA.
44118	He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke.
44119	He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December.
44120	In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo.
44121	His wife called 911.
44122	He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed.
44123	He felt better.
44124	He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly.
44125	An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia.
44126	Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.
44127	He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.
44128	He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet.
44129	He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy.
44130	He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication.
44131	There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms.
44132	Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms.
44133	He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission.
44134	He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.
44135	Lying down he was hypertensive.
44136	He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119.
44137	CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine.
44138	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male.
44139	Blood pressure 160/90 sitting, standing 155/90.
44140	Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia.
44141	Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable.
44142	No bruits.
44143	There are bilateral CEA scars.
44144	Motor examination: No drift.
44145	Power 5/5 throughout.
44146	Fine finger movements intact.
44147	In the lower extremities.
44148	Power 5/5 on the right.
44149	The left he is status post left knee fusion.
44150	The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength.
44151	His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady.
44152	DTRs 1+ throughout.
44153	DATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable.
44154	CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described.
44155	CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA.
44156	Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA.
44157	There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect.
44158	There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.
44159	Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.
44160	Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged.
44161	A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study.
44162	The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis.
44163	Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged.
44164	Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged.
44165	Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study.
44166	New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature.
44167	Followup chest x-ray 11/14/2119 was unremarkable.
44168	Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted.
44169	In 09/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable.
44170	IMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12/2119.
44171	He has been doing well considering.
44172	The cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.
44173	It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology.
44174	He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline.
44175	Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement.
44176	His blood pressure is a little high today.
44177	He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks.
44178	Recommended that he continue to work with Guy on vestibular therapy.
44179	Followup with me in 3 months.

44375	North Andover, KY  41454
44376	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.
44377	The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.
44378	In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.
44379	The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.
44380	There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
44381	The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.
44382	Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.
44383	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.
44384	She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.
44385	MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
44386	She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.
44387	SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.
44388	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.
44389	Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.
44390	The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
44391	Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.
44392	There is no murmur.
44393	The abdomen is soft and nontender.
44394	The liver is not palpably enlarged.
44395	The extremities are warm without edema.
44396	Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.
44397	There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
44398	There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.
44399	Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.
44400	Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.
44401	In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.
44402	Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.
44403	We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.
44404	There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.
44405	Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.
44406	Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.
44407	Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

44613	Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.
44614	After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.
44615	He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.
44616	After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.
44617	MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.
44618	Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.
44619	L shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN).
44620	Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.
44621	He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.
44622	He was started on cefazolin.
44623	Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).
44624	Blood cultures were negative.
44625	He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.
44626	Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.
44627	A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.
44628	He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.
44629	Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.
44630	Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head.
44631	Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.
44632	Mr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.
44633	He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.
44634	No drainage.
44635	Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.
44636	Blood glucoses had been well controlled.
44637	His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.

44643	Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.
44644	Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem.

44719	Micro Data: 
44720	None recently
44721	Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)
44722	Imaging:
44723	Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.
44724	The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear.
44725	The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease.
44726	There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.
44727	AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.
44728	Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.
44729	With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.
44730	Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.
44731	The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.
44732	He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).
44733	Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.
44734	However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.
44735	As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.
44736	The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.
44737	However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.
44738	This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.
44739	Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).
44740	Recommendations:
44741	-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data
44742	-Aspirate shoulder.
44743	Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures
44744	-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement
44745	-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection
44746	-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement
44747	-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo
44748	Thank you for this interesting consultation.
44749	We will continue to follow with you.

45620	I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.
45621	I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.
45622	Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.
45623	I would only add/emphasize the following:
45624	Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 
45625	h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
45626	Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
45627	Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
45628	Pneumonia several times in the past 
45629	Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
45630	Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
45631	Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
45632	Elevated lipids - on statin 
45633	Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.)
45634	Kidney stones 
45635	Patent foramen ovale
45636	He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.
45637	He has improved with heart rate control.
45638	Exam
45639	VS - as noted
45640	General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.
45641	Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.
45642	CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
45643	Lungs - clear
45644	Abdomen - obese
45645	Extremities - minimal edema
45646	Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.
45647	Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.
45648	Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.
45649	Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.
45650	"I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission."
45651	Recommendations:  
45652	Increase metoprolol dose.
45653	May need Toprol XL 100 BID.
45654	Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.
45655	Filter all IVs (PFO)
45656	PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
45657	Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

45725	She states 
45726	that she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not 
45727	know the amount of insulin that she has been taking.
45728	It has been

45738	pressure was 152/80 in her left arm.

45740	It should be 
45741	noted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday.

45743	which reflects a 1/2 lb.
45744	weight loss since 11-70.

45746	regular rate and rhythm at 80.
45747	Her neck veins were flat.

45847	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xian is 75 years of age.
45848	She has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required
45849	treatment with insulin.
45850	She has been managed with oral
45851	hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections.
45852	She also has a history of CVA.
45853	I last saw her in August of last year.
45854	She was seen by Ms.
45855	Vann, our nurse practitioner in early May.
45856	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and
45857	two in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o.
45858	q.d., and Avandia
45859	2 mg one p.o.
45860	q.a.m.
45861	According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr
45862	29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg
45863	one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was
45864	prescribed back in 2072.
45865	The patient and her son today are
45866	not sure that she is taking this medication.
45867	In fact, they
45868	believe that she is not.
45869	There has been moderate polyuria
45870	and polydipsia.
45871	Control of diabetes has been erratic.
45872	Hemoglobin A1c has been elevated.
45873	On Apr 29, 2073, blood
45874	glucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes
45875	within normal limits as was calcium.
45876	Cholesterol was 315.
45877	Hemoglobin A1c 10.6.
45878	The patient has not experienced chest
45879	pain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath
45880	when climbing stairs.
45881	There has been no orthopnea and no
45882	PND.
45883	She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced
45884	near syncope.
45885	She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
45886	constipation.
45887	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination today, she
45888	appears well.
45889	Blood pressure 122/66.
45890	The heart rate is 90
45891	and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds
45892	less than last year.
45893	Random blood glucose was 224.
45894	The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071.
45895	She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms
45896	suggestive of TIA.
45897	The patient has a past history of
45898	hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.
45899	She has
45900	not been hypothyroid since then.
45901	In fact, the last TSH
45902	level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her
45903	departure to Ghana.
45904	She denies heat intolerance as well
45905	as palpitations.
45906	On physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute
45907	distress.
45908	The neck veins are flat.
45909	The extraocular
45910	movements are full.
45911	There are no symptoms of
45912	hyperthyroidism.
45913	The chest is clear to auscultation.
45914	The
45915	heart sounds are regular.
45916	There are no rubs or gallops.
45917	The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are
45918	free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require
45919	attention.
45920	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
45921	history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131
45922	with good results who, last year before she left the
45923	country, had a subnormal TSH.
45924	She does not have obvious
45925	symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
45926	repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.
45927	Diabetes continues to be a problem.
45928	Glycemic control
45929	continues to be difficult to achieve.
45930	Today, I have
45931	reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o.
45932	q.d.
45933	The son is going
45934	to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
45935	is not taking this medicine at this point.
45936	The other
45937	medications were continued.
45938	It is indeed possible that she
45939	will need insulin in the near future.
45940	I plan close followup
45941	and will see her again in six weeks' time.
45942	If she is
45943	hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in
45944	achieving glycemic control.
45945	Against this is the high
45946	cholesterol.
45947	She used to be on Lipitor, which was
45948	discontinued during her trip to Ghana.
45949	I have
45950	reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o.
45951	I have also
45952	added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o.
45953	to protect
45954	her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

46027	Pt was seen last week by Dr.Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna.
46028	I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed Glyburide, Actos and Insulin.
46029	The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  Metformin because of GI intolerance and her regimen was Insulin only.
46030	She did not keep subsequent appointments.
46031	She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis/UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin.
46032	She has now completed the treatment.

46085	Dear Doctor Trejo:
46086	I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Tyler Pearson, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today.
46087	As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.
46088	He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.
46089	He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.
46090	A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.
46091	Assessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.
46092	It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.
46093	I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.
46094	Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.
46095	If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.
46096	Sincerely,
46097	"						Steven E. Land, M.D."

46334	EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.
46335	He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.
46336	An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.
46337	His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.
46338	He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.
46339	He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.
46340	He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.
46341	He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.

46412	     Right upper lobe and right middle lobe opacity, new since
46413	     5/27/2132, suspicious for pneumonia.
46414	Lines and tubes as described above, without evidence of
46415	     pneumothorax following left IJ placement.
46416	EKG: sinus tachycardia at 134bpm; right ventricular hypertrophy; 0.5mm ST depression V6
46417	Assessment and Plan
46418	Mr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.
46419	He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
46420	He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.
46421	His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
46422	Sepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12
46423	a. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12
46424	b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)
46425	c. monitor urine output
46426	d. measure central venous oxygen saturation
46427	e. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am
46428	f.  f/u all culture data
46429	g. continue advair 250/50
46430	h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED
46431	i.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension
46432	ARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration
46433	Ppx: ranitidine and heparin
