264	3	a	HPI:  74 RHD M with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type II DM, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia.
265	1	a	On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.
266	1	a	This was complicated by a postoperative MI.
267	1	a	03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
268	1	a	is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.
269	1	a	Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.
270	1	a	He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.
271	1	a	We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

382	1	a	Dear Quin,
383	1	a	Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.
384	3	a	As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083.
385	1	a	She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.
386	1	a	She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.
387	1	a	An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.
388	1	a	Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.
389	1	a	At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.
390	1	a	Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.
391	1	a	Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.
392	1	a	There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
393	1	a	After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.
394	1	a	"She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s."
395	1	a	She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.
396	1	a	She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.
397	1	a	It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.
398	1	a	A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.
399	1	a	With best regards.
400	1	a	Sincerely yours,

449	1	a	The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
450	1	a	Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration.
451	1	a	On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin.
452	1	a	The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis.
453	1	a	&gt; Continue other home meds.
454	1	a	&gt; Check CSA level in am.
455	1	a	&gt; Since stable volume status, consider contacting renal in am for further decision about next HD session depending on lab results.
456	1	a	&gt; Will continue lasix on nonHD days.
457	1	a	&gt; Will defer further testing to primary cardiologist in am.
458	1	a	&gt; CPAP at night

563	1	a	Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.
564	1	a	LABORATORY STUDIES:  
565	1	a	Recent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.
566	1	a	Liver function tests are within normal limits.
567	1	a	Hemoglobin A1c is 6.
568	1	a	White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.
569	1	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  
570	1	a	The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.
571	1	a	To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.
572	1	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
573	1	a	1.
574	1	a	Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
575	1	a	This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
576	1	a	I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
577	1	a	I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
578	1	a	This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
579	1	a	These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
580	1	a	I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.
581	1	a	The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.
582	1	a	However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.
583	1	a	I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
584	1	a	However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.
585	1	a	I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
586	1	a	2.
587	1	a	Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
588	1	a	If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.
589	1	a	He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
590	1	a	The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
591	1	a	In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.
592	1	a	At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.
593	1	a	At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.
594	1	a	The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
595	1	a	Sincerely,

1085	1	a	Assessment and plan:
1086	1	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
1087	1	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
1088	1	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
1089	1	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
1090	1	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
1091	1	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
1092	1	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
1093	1	a	Will discuss with Drs.
1094	1	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
1095	1	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
1096	1	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
1097	1	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
1098	1	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
1099	1	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
1100	3	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
1101	1	a	Follow sugars while in house
1102	1	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

1504	1	a	I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.
1505	1	a	Please see
1506	1	a	his note for further details.
1507	1	a	I confirm that I have interviewed
1508	1	a	and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation
1509	1	a	on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of
1510	1	a	care, and disposition with the patient.
1511	1	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male
1512	3	a	with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery
1513	1	a	disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,
1514	1	a	status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.
1515	1	a	He was
1516	1	a	discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.
1517	1	a	He
1518	1	a	had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed
1519	1	a	with a right lower lobe pneumonia.
1520	1	a	He was also given 1 g of
1521	1	a	ceftriaxone.
1522	1	a	His complaints prior to presentation had been chest
1523	1	a	pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and
1524	1	a	palpitations.
1525	1	a	On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem
1526	1	a	and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.
1527	1	a	Other systems
1528	1	a	were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,
1529	1	a	hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.
1530	1	a	MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.
1531	1	a	Please see the chart.
1532	1	a	He is currently
1533	1	a	on aspirin and took today.
1534	1	a	ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.
1535	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic
1536	1	a	appearing, and nontoxic.
1537	1	a	Temperature 98, pulse of 111,
1538	1	a	respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations
1539	1	a	are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.
1540	1	a	HEENT exam:  Mucosal
1541	1	a	membranes are dry.
1542	1	a	Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.
1543	1	a	Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.
1544	1	a	Left lung is clear.
1545	1	a	CVS: 
1546	1	a	Tachycardic but regular.
1547	1	a	Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse
1548	1	a	tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no
1549	1	a	Murphy's.
1550	1	a	He has normoactive bowel sounds.
1551	1	a	Skin is warm and
1552	1	a	dry.
1553	1	a	Back is nontender at CVA points.
1554	1	a	He has got bilateral
1555	1	a	lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and
1556	1	a	calves.
1557	1	a	Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented
1558	1	a	without focal motor or sensory deficits.
1559	1	a	LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2
1560	1	a	bands.
1561	1	a	Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated
1562	1	a	with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of
1563	1	a	1.2 when he was discharged.
1564	1	a	LFTs are all normal including lipase
1565	1	a	and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly
1566	1	a	elevated.
1567	1	a	First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.
1568	1	a	EKG shows a
1569	1	a	sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave
1570	1	a	changes.
1571	1	a	Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have
1572	1	a	been there in the past.
1573	1	a	There is a hazy opacity in the right mid
1574	1	a	hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could
1575	1	a	represent tumor versus pneumonia.
1576	1	a	However, no significant change
1577	1	a	prior to his discharge.
1578	1	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated
1579	1	a	white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.
1580	1	a	admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.
1581	1	a	He is in stable
1582	1	a	condition.

1689	1	a	Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.
1690	1	a	At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.
1691	1	a	The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.

1755	1	a	Assessment: 56 yo woman with chronically high blood sugars, who now, in the setting of recently increased insulin and low blood sugars, presents with fall and LOC, likely a hypoglycemic seizure.
1756	1	a	Plan:
1757	1	a	Syncope- most likely etiology hypoglycemic seizure.
1758	1	a	Given pt's markedly elevated HbA1C, blood sugars likely very high chronically.
1759	1	a	Now with tight glycemic control, including blood sugars in the 50s, pt likely seized.
1760	1	a	Other worrisome etiologies would include cardiac- has multiple risk factors, but no data supporting CAD (enzymes negative, ECG no change, no signs/symptoms of CHF, no valvular disease, no history of arrhythmias)  Will continue rule out MI.
1761	1	a	Don't think TTE necessary.
1762	1	a	Also, could be cerebrovascular disease, although imaging of cerebral vasculature has been mostly normal.
1763	1	a	Head CT negative for bleed.

2302	1	a	"	Reason for visit:"
2303	1	a	   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.
2304	1	a	Interval History:
2305	1	a	   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097.
2306	1	a	At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion.
2307	1	a	Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization.
2308	1	a	Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD.
2309	1	a	He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation.
2310	1	a	Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease.
2311	1	a	He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer.
2312	1	a	His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch.
2313	1	a	He required re-exploration for bleeding.
2314	1	a	He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone.
2315	1	a	His IABP was removed a few days post operatively.
2316	1	a	He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%.
2317	1	a	He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab.
2318	1	a	Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV.
2319	1	a	The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD.
2320	1	a	He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents.
2321	1	a	His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function.
2322	1	a	He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability.
2323	1	a	He was followed by Dr. Hardin.
2324	1	a	His HIT assay was borderline negative.
2325	1	a	He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban.
2326	1	a	Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux.
2327	1	a	A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation.
2328	1	a	He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20.
2329	1	a	He was discharged from rehab on June 5th.
2330	1	a	On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA.
2331	1	a	His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half.
2332	1	a	He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations.
2333	1	a	He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees.
2334	1	a	The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath.
2335	1	a	His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid.
2336	1	a	However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%.
2337	1	a	911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation.
2338	1	a	Past medical history:
2339	3	a	   CM/CAD as described, Hypertension, Type II DM x 15 yrs- with nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, Mild renal insufficiency, PVD, Carotid disease, Factor VII Deficiency, BPH, Hearing loss, Vitamin B12 deficiency.

2408	1	a	Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated.
2409	1	a	Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally).
2410	1	a	Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis.
2411	1	a	If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow.
2412	1	a	Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion.
2413	1	a	continue aspirin and Plavix.

2767	1	a	Since I saw him last six months ago, he has generally done well.
2768	1	a	He has not had any angina.
2769	1	a	No dyspnea, orthopnea, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope.
2770	1	a	He has reduced his exercise to three days a week-he exercises vigorously when he does exercise, but this seems to give him a little bit more in the way of stamina.
2771	1	a	Past medical history:
2772	1	a	   Noncontributory.

2812	1	a	    shows first-degree AV bock and minor ST and T changes.
2813	1	a	No change from July 2075.
2814	1	a	Assessment and plan:
2815	1	a	   Mr.  Lilly is generally doing well.
2816	3	a	His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes.
2817	1	a	On the other hand, he is a little worked up over his wife's injury, and we will monitor his pressure.
2818	1	a	For now, we will sit tight.
2819	1	a	He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr.  Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.
2820	1	a	Plan: Monitor blood pressure.
2821	1	a	Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor.
2822	1	a	Chemistries tomorrow.
2823	1	a	See again in six months.

3342	1	a	"Because of the afternoon period he describes as being like a ""Warewolf"" (4-7 pm), I recommended he use this time for exercise rather than for his other, more sedentary, activities."
3343	1	a	At a later time we can consider medication (in this case, orlistat).
3344	1	a	Currently progress is excellent without needing it.
3345	1	a	Discuss elevated BP with PCP, may need higher dose of ACEI.
3346	1	a	F/U w/ me 2 - 2.5 mos.
3347	1	a	>50% of the 30-minute visit was spent counseling the patient about the potential implications of obesity and obesity-related conditions, and the above treatment plan.
3348	1	a	All questions answered.

3354	1	a	Patient Name: RICO, NATHAN C                     
3355	1	a	MRN: 9190908
3356	1	a	Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    
3357	1	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
3358	1	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
3359	1	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
3360	1	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
3361	1	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
3362	1	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
3363	1	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
3364	1	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
3365	1	a	Homocysteine was normal.
3366	1	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
3367	1	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
3368	1	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
3369	1	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
3370	1	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
3371	1	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
3372	1	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
3373	1	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
3374	1	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
3375	1	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
3376	1	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
3377	1	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
3378	1	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
3379	1	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
3380	1	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
3381	1	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
3382	1	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
3383	1	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
3384	1	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
3385	1	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
3386	1	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
3387	1	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
3388	1	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
3389	1	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
3390	1	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
3391	1	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
3392	1	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
3393	1	a	He is unable to work.
3394	1	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
3395	1	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
3396	1	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
3397	1	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
3398	1	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
3399	1	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
3400	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
3401	1	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
3402	1	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
3403	1	a	His hair has now grown back.
3404	1	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
3405	1	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
3406	1	a	Eye contact is good.
3407	1	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
3408	1	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
3409	1	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
3410	1	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
3411	1	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
3412	1	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
3413	1	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
3414	1	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
3415	1	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
3416	1	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
3417	1	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
3418	1	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
3419	1	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
3420	1	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
3421	1	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
3422	1	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
3423	1	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
3424	1	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
3425	1	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
3426	1	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
3427	1	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
3428	1	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
3429	1	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
3430	1	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
3431	1	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
3432	1	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
3433	1	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
3434	1	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
3435	1	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

3743	1	a	The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.
3744	1	a	This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid.

3756	3	a	Mrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN.
3757	1	a	Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past.
3758	1	a	The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however.
3759	1	a	She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive.
3760	1	a	It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.
3761	1	a	Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.
3762	1	a	Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging.

3936	1	a	HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, 
3937	3	a	complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane.
3938	1	a	She comes in today for routine follow-up.
3939	3	a	Patient's diabetes was 
3940	1	a	initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.
3941	1	a	Patient was 
3942	1	a	formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 
3943	1	a	months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have 
3944	1	a	been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.
3945	1	a	Patient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser 
3946	1	a	treatment to the cervix.
3947	1	a	She is a hemophiliac carrier.
3948	1	a	Has a history of 
3949	1	a	migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.
3950	1	a	Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide 
3951	1	a	in July.
3952	1	a	It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut 
3953	1	a	her left upper extremity.
3954	1	a	Since then she states that she has been feeling 
3955	1	a	a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.
3956	1	a	Her mood seems fine today in clinic.
3957	1	a	Patient denies any medical symptoms 
3958	1	a	at this time.
3959	1	a	Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.
3960	1	a	A 
3961	1	a	positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who 
3962	1	a	just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at 
3963	1	a	age 40 and a CABG at age 43.
3964	1	a	Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia 
3965	3	a	or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.
3966	1	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks 
3967	1	a	about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.
3968	1	a	She says that she should not be drinking with her medications.
3969	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.
3970	1	a	Blood pressure: 120/70.
3971	1	a	HEENT: unremarkable.

3973	1	a	2+ bilaterally without bruits.

3976	1	a	limits.
3977	1	a	Abdomen: benign.
3978	1	a	Extremities: without edema.
3979	1	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
3980	1	a	1.
3981	1	a	Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 
3982	1	a	     16 months.
3983	1	a	I told her how impressed I was with this.
3984	1	a	She, in fact, 
3985	1	a	     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at 
3986	1	a	     this time.
3987	1	a	I will let her continue this dietary control for the next 
3988	1	a	     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her 
3989	1	a	     control.
3990	1	a	However, in the past, she has been very straight forward 
3991	1	a	     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.
3992	1	a	2.
3993	1	a	Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.
3994	1	a	Is 
3995	1	a	     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.
3996	1	a	She will 
3997	1	a	     continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very 
3998	1	a	     happy.

4002	1	a	     time.
4003	1	a	Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed 
4004	1	a	     in June.
4005	1	a	She does not take oral contraceptives because of her 
4006	3	a	     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.
4007	1	a	She was instructed 
4008	1	a	     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to 
4009	1	a	     the IUD occur.
4010	1	a	4.
4011	1	a	Diabetes:  Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as 
4012	1	a	     mentioned above.
4013	1	a	I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time.
4014	1	a	Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no 
4015	1	a	     headache.
4016	1	a	I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time.
4017	1	a	Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.

4271	1	a	 Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today.
4272	1	a	Her daughter Gibbs was translating.
4273	3	a	She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems.
4274	1	a	She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past.
4275	1	a	Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house.
4276	1	a	They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication.
4277	1	a	When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not.
4278	1	a	Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol.
4279	1	a	Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning.
4280	1	a	She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars.
4281	1	a	She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low.
4282	1	a	She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat.

4284	1	a	She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249.
4285	1	a	The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner.
4286	1	a	The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times.
4287	1	a	She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating.
4288	1	a	She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations.
4289	1	a	Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down.
4290	1	a	No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness.
4291	1	a	Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved.
4292	1	a	Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response.
4293	1	a	No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images.
4294	1	a	From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length.
4295	1	a	She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid.
4296	1	a	Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct.
4297	1	a	The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia.
4298	1	a	Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not.
4299	1	a	Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia.
4300	1	a	She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital.
4301	1	a	On exam she is in no acute distress.
4302	1	a	Blood pressure 124/60.

4315	1	a	1.
4316	1	a	Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen.
4317	1	a	Continue same.
4318	1	a	Check Chem-7.
4319	3	a	Type 2 diabetes.
4320	1	a	Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low.
4321	1	a	Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar.
4322	1	a	Lightheadedness and dizziness.
4323	1	a	We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck.
4324	1	a	She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor.
4325	1	a	She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.
