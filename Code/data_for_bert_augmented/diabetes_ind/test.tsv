83	Reason for Visit
84	Sternal pain.
85	History of Present Illness
86	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
87	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
88	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
89	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
90	No variation with food.
91	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
92	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
93	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
94	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

138	No focal rhonchi.
139	No pleural rub.
140	+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth.
141	No sternal movement wiht palpation.
142	No palpable sternal wire.
143	Cor/Cardiac
144	RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub.

148	+ bowel sounds.
149	Extremity
150	Warm.
151	No edema.
152	Lab Test
153	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
154	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
155	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
156	Impression
157	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
158	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
159	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
160	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
161	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
162	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
163	Plan
164	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
165	- check CXR
166	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
167	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
168	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
169	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

218	This is a preliminary dictation.
219	PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
220	patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 
221	diabetes who presents with fever and chills.
222	He is four weeks 
223	status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 
224	infected and had to be revised.
225	He has been doing well, but now 
226	presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 
227	his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 
228	taking Advil for the fever).
229	He presents for evaluation.
230	He has 
231	had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 
232	for the past two months secondary to his graft infection.
233	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.
234	MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin.
235	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
236	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 
237	179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 
238	degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.
239	There are some 
240	crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.
241	The 
242	heart has a regular rate and rhythm.
243	The abdomen is soft and 
244	non-tender, with good bowel sounds.
245	There is a right groin mass, 
246	questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.
247	The extremities 
248	are well-perfused.
249	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 
250	normal.
251	The blood sugar is 180.
252	The white count is normal at 3.7.
253	The hematocrit is 29.
254	The PT/PTT are pending.
255	The urinalysis is 
256	negative so far, with microscopic pending.
257	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery.
258	The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 
259	patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending.
260	Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 
261	history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 
262	who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 
263	a fever.
264	Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.
265	A Surgery 
266	consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 
267	pending.
268	The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 
269	Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 
270	disposition.
271	The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending.
272	CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery.
273	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever.
274	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
275	admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 
276	condition.

395	I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.
396	Please see his note for
397	further details.
398	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined
399	the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and
400	discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
401	History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says
402	yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.
403	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
404	gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.
405	He has indwelling
406	Foley catheter.
407	He was transported from nursing home to ED as he
408	has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.
409	Per EMS, they were
410	told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased
411	POs today.
412	He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.
413	He
414	then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more
415	awake and alert.
416	He is telling the paramedics that he is at his
417	baseline.
418	He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.
419	No chest
420	pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers
421	or chills.
422	He reports that he is able to discern when he has
423	abdominal pain.
424	He has intact sensation.
425	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.
426	In addition, CAD, diabetes,
427	hypertension, CHF.

437	distress.
438	Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure
439	102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.
440	HEENT exam: 
441	Normocephalic and atraumatic.
442	Neck:  Supple.
443	He has coarse
444	upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.
445	Heart is regular
446	rate and rhythm.
447	His abdomen is slightly distended.
448	He is
449	nontender.
450	He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,
451	no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower
452	extremities.
453	He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.
454	The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his
455	urinary tract infection.
456	His urine and his catheter was cloudy.
457	Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the
458	lab, the patient had his catheter changed.
459	He then began to no
460	longer drain urine.
461	Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on
462	using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder.
463	Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were
464	unsuccessful.
465	There was pus found at the meatus.
466	At this point,
467	the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology
468	evaluation.
469	He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI
470	and/or abscess.
471	LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

477	hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.
478	Coags within normal
479	limits.
480	UA again is pending at this time.
481	He will be admitted to the hospital.
482	I attempted to reach the
483	patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the
484	WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.
485	At this point, I
486	am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and
487	urology evaluation.
488	DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.
489	CONDITION:  Stable.
490	DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.

621	His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.
622	Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.
623	He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.
624	He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.
625	His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.
626	An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).
627	His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.
628	Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.
629	He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.
630	On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.
631	He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.
632	He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

692	A/P
693	: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia
694	#) Hyperglycemia:
695	 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS.
696	Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ?
697	underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).
698	No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).
699	Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.
700	Current FSBG 330.
701	Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.
702	Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN
703	#) A-fib:
704	 New onset a-fib.
705	Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).
706	CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.
707	Currently rate-controlled 80s.
708	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.
709	Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.
710	On ASA.
711	Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.
712	#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease.
713	Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.
714	#) Edema
715	: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc).
716	Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.
717	Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc.
718	w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.
719	Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.
720	#) Bullous pemphigoid
721	: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks.
722	Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.
723	#) HTN
724	: Currently well-controlled.

732	?
733	PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).
734	Will hold antibiotics.
735	#) Gout: cont.

1121	the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation 
1122	and plan.
1123	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.
1124	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 
1125	complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.

1129	The patient denies 
1130	any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he 
1131	feels poorly.
1132	Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood 
1133	sugar was noted to be greater than 600.
1134	The patient does not 
1135	complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 
1136	light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath.
1137	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note.
1138	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.
1139	Otherwise, as per the 
1140	resident's note.
1141	SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note.
1142	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, 
1143	respirations 22.
1144	The patient appears to be in no acute distress.
1145	The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.
1146	There is 
1147	jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.
1148	Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.
1149	Abdominal examination is 
1150	within normal limits.
1151	The patient has a colostomy.
1152	The patient

1170	congestive heart failure.
1171	He may be having new cardiac event, 
1172	although after a consultation with the Integra Health
1173	cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, 
1174	but rather due to axis deviation.
1175	The patient is being treated for 
1176	his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.
1177	FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1178	1.
1179	Rule out myocardial infarction.

2192	Dear Thomas:
2193	  Thank you very much for referring Mr.
2194	Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
2195	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
2196	Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
2197	The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
2198	After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.
2199	It has been progressive over the last several months.
2200	He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
2201	He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.
2202	He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.
2203	Past medical history:
2204	   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.

2224	 Protonix
2225	Allergies:
2226	No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.
2227	Family history:
2228	   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.
2229	There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.
2230	Social history:
2231	   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.
2232	He does not drink alcohol.
2233	He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
2234	Review of systems:
2235	   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
2236	He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
2237	He denies hematochezia.
2238	He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.
2239	He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.
2240	He denies dysuria or hematuria.
2241	He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
2242	Physical examination:
2243	-Pulse:   55 and regular
2244	-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
2245	-resp.
2246	rate:   12 and unlabored
2247	-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.
2248	Mucous membranes are moist.
2249	Trachea is midline
2250	-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.
2251	Carotids are 2+ without bruits.
2252	Have a normal upstroke.
2253	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
2254	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
2255	He does have low dullness in both bases
2256	-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
2257	He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
2258	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
2259	No organomegaly.
2260	No pulsatile masses
2261	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
2262	He has no pedal edema.
2263	He has no clubbing or cyanosis
2264	Procedures:
2265	Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
2266	His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
2267	Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
2268	He had no chest pain.
2269	Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
2270	The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
2271	EKG:
2272	    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
2273	Selected recent labs:
2274	 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.
2275	Assessment and plan:
2276	   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096.
2277	His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
2278	There are a number of factors involved here.
2279	He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
2280	I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.
2281	He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
2282	He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
2283	He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
2284	He also has low platelets.
2285	The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
2286	It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
2287	He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.
2288	Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
2289	He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
2290	My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
2291	He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
2292	I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.
2293	I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.
2294	Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
2295	Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

2393	                                                         Date of Visit: 05/11/2089
2394	REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
2395	visit.
2396	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
2397	any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.
2398	He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.
2399	He and his wife are 
2400	planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
2401	long weekends in New Mexico.
2402	He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.
2403	The pains in his hips 
2404	and legs have not been bothering him.
2405	When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
2406	gets results that range between 170 and 120.
2407	He has not been specifically 
2408	exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
2409	and walk the intervening distance.
2410	He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
2411	per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.
2412	Otherwise, the review of systems is 
2413	unremarkable.
2414	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.
2415	Blood pressure in the 
2416	right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.
2417	Chest is clear to P&A.
2418	Heart 
2419	sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.
2420	Neck 
2421	veins are not distended.
2422	Abdomen is nontender.
2423	Extremities have good dorsalis 
2424	pedis pulses.
2425	Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.
2426	IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.
2427	He remains 
2428	moderately hyperglycemic.
2429	He has an appointment to be followed by the 
2430	urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
2431	specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
2432	considered only a risk factor).
2433	PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
2434	the results are available.
2435	He should return in 6 months.

2451	Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.
2452	I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).
2453	I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.
2454	If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.
2455	Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.
2456	I don't think this will interfere with your trip.
2457	Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.
2458	Best wishes,

2725	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
2726	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
2727	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
2728	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
2729	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
2730	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
2731	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
2732	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
2733	He never developed chest pain.
2734	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
2735	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
2736	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
2737	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
2738	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
2739	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
2740	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
2741	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
2742	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
2743	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
2744	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
2745	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
2746	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
2747	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.
2748	He denies any calf pain.

3003	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
3004	60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.
3005	For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.
3006	No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.
3007	Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.
3008	Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.
3009	Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.
3010	Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.
3011	1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.
3012	This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.
3013	Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.
3014	May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.
3015	No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.
3016	Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.

3241	HPI:
3242	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain.
3243	She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.
3244	It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
3245	It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.
3246	It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.
3247	It tapered off over about 20 minutes.
3248	She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.
3249	She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.
3250	She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.
3251	She has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).
3252	She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.
3253	She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.
3254	DCA ED Course:
3255	Initial EKG NSR without ischemic changes
3256	Initial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.
3257	CXR unremarkable.
3258	She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.
3259	She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.
3260	She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment.

3375	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.
3376	Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.
3377	TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).
3378	DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).
3379	The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.
3380	Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.
3381	She is currently CP free.
3382	1.
3383	Chest pain
3384	-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now
3385	-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.
3386	Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
3387	-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult
3388	-     TTE in AM
3389	-     Check amylase, lipase 
3390	-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM
3391	-     Smoking cessation consult
3392	2.
3393	Lupus-like condition
3394	-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM
3395	3.
3396	DM
3397	-     Check HbA1c
3398	-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS
3399	4.
3400	Renal
3401	-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate
3402	5.
3403	Psych
3404	-     continue home regimen &#8211; klonopin, effexor, topamax

3414	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.
3415	Chest pain.
3416	The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.
3417	He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.
3418	The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.
3419	He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.
3420	The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.
3421	He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.
3422	The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.
3423	It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.
3424	Left renal lesion.
3425	As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.
3426	The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.
3427	I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.
3428	Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3429	The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.
3430	Obstructive sleep apnea.
3431	The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.
3432	Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.
3433	Elevated blood pressure.
3434	The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.
3435	Gastroesophageal reflux.
3436	The patient feels well on Zantac.
3437	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.
3438	He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.
3439	He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.
3440	He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.
3441	He has no burning on urination.
3442	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.
3443	His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.
3444	Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.
3445	The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.
3446	The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.
3447	The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.
3448	Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.
3449	Abdomen is soft.
3450	No liver or spleen was felt.
3451	Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
3452	Neurologically, the patient was alert.
3453	The patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.
3454	The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.
3455	1.
3456	Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
3457	2.
3458	New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.
3459	3.
3460	Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.
3461	4.
3462	Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
3463	5.
3464	Abnormal LFTs by history.
3465	6.
3466	Diabetes mellitus.
3467	7.
3468	Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.

3795	ago and is working full-time.
3796	There has been no orthopnea, PND or
3797	peripheral edema.
3798	She is interested in increasing her physical
3799	activity program.
3800	Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
3801	20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
3802	developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.
3803	She is
3804	perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
3805	gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
3806	Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.

3819	No peripheral edema.
3820	Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
3821	and is a normal tracing.
3822	For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
3823	gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
3824	using the standard bruce protocol.
3825	She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
3826	seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
3827	chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.
3828	Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
3829	maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure.
3830	There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
3831	load.
3832	Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
3833	seconds longer.

3836	No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time.
3837	She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
3838	hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
3839	perimenopausal state.
3840	She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
3841	her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
3842	profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
3843	PAGE 2
3844	instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.
3845	From a cardiac
3846	standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.
3847	Low
3848	dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
3849	I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
3850	evaluation as needed in the future.

4052	Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.
4053	He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.
4054	He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.
4055	After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.
4056	He denies any history of trauma.
4057	He is a former smoker.
4058	He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.
4059	He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.
4060	Past surgical history is as above.
4061	Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.
4062	No known drug allergies.
4063	Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.
4064	All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.
4065	Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.
4066	He denies alcohol use.
4067	Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.
4068	On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.
4069	Respiratory rate is 12-14.
4070	Pulse is 60-70 and regular.
4071	Weight is 172 pounds.
4072	Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.
4073	No jugular venous distention.
4074	Normal respiratory effort.
4075	Lungs are clear to auscultation.
4076	Heart, regular rate and rhythm.
4077	No murmur or bruit.
4078	He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.
4079	He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.
4080	Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.
4081	On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.
4082	He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.
4083	No varicosities.

4089	Assessment and Plan:  
4090	1.
4091	Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.
4092	We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.
4093	We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.
4094	If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.
4095	2.
4096	Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.
4097	3.
4098	Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.
4099	His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.
4100	We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.
4101	4.
4102	Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4103	The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.
4104	I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.
4105	Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.
4106	If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.
4107	Sincerely,

4199	There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations.
4200	No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand.
4201	Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place.
4202	As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.
4203	Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR).

4224	RE:  Gerald, Marion 
4225	MRN: 48967301 
4226	DOV: 05/18/83
4227	Dear Dr. Olive,
4228	Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.
4229	She is 
4230	referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.
4231	The patient states she is 
4232	currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 
4233	developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.
4234	This continued to bother her 
4235	and she eventually was treated with steroids.
4236	I am not sure she had a 
4237	diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.
4238	She then was switched to ibuprofen which 
4239	did not work particularly well.
4240	Over this time, she would have intermittent 
4241	episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 
4242	her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.
4243	She was seen by 
4244	Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 
4245	"she had ""25 shots"" of steroids."
4246	She denies any hot or swollen joints.
4247	She 
4248	has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.
4249	Extensive ROS reveals 
4250	no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.
4251	has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 
4252	well.
4253	She has continued to be concerned about that.
4254	She has had fevers or 
4255	chills but no temperature elevation.
4256	She has intermittent abdominal pain but 
4257	has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.
4258	She has 
4259	morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.
4260	Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.
4261	Mother is 
4262	85.
4263	Two sons alive and well.
4264	Two siblings alive and well except for 
4265	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
4266	Past medical history is pertinent for above.
4267	She has had a partial 
4268	hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.
4269	Medications 
4270	include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 
4271	metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 
4272	q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.
4273	No smoking or drinking history.
4274	No allergies.
4275	No other medical problems.
4276	Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.
4277	She works as a 
4278	midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.
4279	Her husband is 
4280	a Broadcast Technician.
4281	They have traveled quite a bit because of this.
4282	Page 2
4283	Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.
4284	Weight 152.
4285	BP 
4286	120/80.
4287	She had a respiratory rate of 16.
4288	She had full range of motion of 
4289	all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 
4290	cervical and lumbar area.
4291	Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.
4292	No oral ulcerations.
4293	Good salivary pool.
4294	No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 
4295	or axillary adenopathy.
4296	Chest: clear to A&P.
4297	No carotid bruits.
4298	Vascular 
4299	exam: normal.
4300	Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.
4301	Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.
4302	Extremities: without 
4303	edema.
4304	I suspect she has fibromyalgia.
4305	I do not really know the place of steroids 
4306	in this setting.
4307	I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 
4308	CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.
4309	I will see her back in four 
4310	to six weeks.
4311	She will get old records for me to review.
4312	We will talk about 
4313	what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 
4314	have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.
4315	I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.
4316	Sincerely yours,

4333	Dear Dr. Higgins,
4334	Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary
4335	care.
4336	I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.
4337	She
4338	comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.
4339	Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.
4340	She has
4341	been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what
4342	she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had
4343	planned.
4344	However, she has other medical problems which I will
4345	deal with until she sees you.
4346	At her last visit, there was a
4347	"question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not"
4348	given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.
4349	However,
4350	she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,
4351	hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include
4352	metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20
4353	q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.
4354	Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces
4355	her pain.
4356	She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
4357	HEENT
4358	was otherwise unremarkable.
4359	I obtained blood studies which
4360	revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62
4361	and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8
4362	with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of
4363	14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.
4364	A1c
4365	pending.
4366	A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did
4367	not reveal proteinuria or sediment.
4368	HBsAG and HCV are pending as
4369	well.
4370	I will be in touch with her regarding these results.
4371	I was
4372	wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of
4373	these abnormalities outlined.
4374	Thanks for letting me participate
4375	in her care.
4376	Sincerely yours,

4389	(449) 515-0294
4390	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest
4391	pain.
4392	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient
4393	with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,
4394	hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous
4395	doctor, Yesenia Olive.
4396	The following issues addressed:
4397	1.
4398	Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any
4399	symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.
4400	Maintained on Glucophage
4401	1000 mg b.i.d.
4402	Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day
4403	is around 120.
4404	We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.
4405	Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.
4406	2.
4407	Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will
4408	be less than a 100.
4409	She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day
4410	and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256.
4411	We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.
4412	3.
4413	Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is
4414	acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.
4415	4.
4416	Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood
4417	pressure is currently acceptable.
4418	5.
4419	Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation
4420	rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in
4421	the past.
4422	No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a
4423	history of recent chest pain.
4424	6.
4425	Exercise-induced chest pain.
4426	The patient has noted over the
4427	past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest
4428	when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.
4429	This
4430	subsides when she stops and rests for a while.
4431	This has been
4432	reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her
4433	husband.
4434	Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had
4435	thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted
4436	heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.
4437	EKG showed 1 mm ST
4438	depression in leads II and V4 through 6.
4439	The thallium scan
4440	showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior
4441	walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending
4442	artery distribution.
4443	She does not recall having symptoms at that
4444	time.
4445	Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with
4446	chest discomfort.
4447	There are some radiation into both shoulders
4448	and neck.
4449	Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,
4450	diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.
4451	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,
4452	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro
4453	150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d.
4454	and Glucophage 500 mg two
4455	tabs b.i.d.
4456	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
4457	SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.
4458	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel
4459	habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.
4460	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.
4461	Temperature
4462	of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.
4463	Pupils are equal,
4464	round and reactive.
4465	Conjunctivae clear.
4466	Sclerae anicteric.
4467	Oropharynx benign.
4468	Neck is supple.
4469	No neck vein distention.
4470	Thyroid is not palpable.
4471	Chest is clear to percussion and
4472	auscultation.
4473	Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,
4474	thrill or gallop.
4475	Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds
4476	and no organomegaly.
4477	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or
4478	edema.
4479	Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
4480	No
4481	abnormal complex.
4482	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
4483	Diabetes.
4484	We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she
4485	has had an ophthalmologic follow up.
4486	Maintain Glucophage.
4487	Elevated cholesterol.
4488	Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.
4489	Chest pain.
4490	Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.
4491	I have
4492	contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an
4493	ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.
4494	I prescribed nitroglycerin
4495	1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes.
4496	x 3 for chest
4497	discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.
4498	Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add
4499	beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing
4500	heart block.
4501	Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current
4502	Levoxyl.
4503	The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and
4504	cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

4517	(449) 515-0294
4518	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.
4519	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
4520	1.
4521	The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in
4522	today having just had a stress test.
4523	Stress test showed that she
4524	was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds
4525	achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,
4526	stopped for fatigue.
4527	Immediately after exercise, she did have
4528	some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.
4529	There were no EKG changes.
4530	The patient reports that she has been
4531	walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise
4532	level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had
4533	precipitated the hospitalization initially.
4534	She is looking into
4535	cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.
4536	She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.
4537	She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a
4538	healthy lifestyle.
4539	She has returned to work.
4540	She has follow up
4541	scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.
4542	2.
4543	Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her
4544	Glucophage 2000 mg a day.
4545	She monitors blood sugars but only in
4546	the morning.
4547	Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.
4548	However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically
4549	sweating and abdominal discomfort.
4550	She has never actually
4551	checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to
4552	occur at work.
4553	She has not had any fainting or dizziness.
4554	3.
4555	Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.
4556	4.
4557	Hypertension.
4558	At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose
4559	because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and
4560	currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.

4567	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness
4568	of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
4569	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in
4570	good spirits.
4571	Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is

4584	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

4586	with stenting.
4587	Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.
4588	At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac
4589	rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.
4590	Diabetes, seems as though her control is 
4591	impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.
4592	We will
4593	discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.
4594	Elevated cholesterol.

4826	RADIOLOGY
4827	Chest CT:  4/11/96
4828	"	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to"
4829	"	suggest pulmonary embolism."
4830	There are several mediastinal lymph
4831	"	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size."
4832	However, in the
4833	"	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes"
4834	"	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis."
4835	These could be
4836	"	reactive or neoplastic."
4837	There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
4838	"	node."
4839	In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
4840	"	parenchymal nodule."
4841	This is best demonstrated on image 65.
4842	This
4843	"	could possibly represent a malignancy."
4844	Alternatively this could
4845	"	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node."
4846	This does not appear to
4847	"	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less"
4848	"	likely."
4849	Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
4850	"	right lung base."
4851	There is no pneumothorax.
4852	No significant
4853	"	pleural fluid is noted."
4854	There is no pericardial fluid.
4855	IMPRESSION:
4856	"	No pulmonary embolism or DVT."
4857	There are multiple mediastinal
4858	"	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe."
4859	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
4860	A follow-up chest CT may be further
4861	"	value."
4862	These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time
4863	"	of dictation."
4864	EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.
4865	A/P:
4866	Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.
4867	This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.
4868	I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.
4869	Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4870	CV:
4871	--Rate:  well controlled without medication.
4872	--Rhythm:  normal sinus
4873	--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.
4874	--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.
4875	Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.
4876	Will obtain stress test in AM.
4877	PULM:  
4878	--plant PPD
4879	--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.
4880	--send ANCA
4881	--follow up CT for nodule
4882	--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing
4883	ENDO:

4893	PATIENT NAME:  MEYER, OSCAR;    MRN:  2771447
4894	Dictated on:  02/06/2095 by VICTOR M. ZUBIA, M.D.
4895	Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:
4896	DATE OF CONSULTATION:
4897	DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
4898	HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.
4899	His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.
4900	Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.
4901	He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.
4902	He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.
4903	The erections are still an important issue with him.
4904	Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.
4905	He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.
4906	In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.
4907	Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.
4908	Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.
4909	Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.
4910	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
4911	1.
4912	Diabetes.
4913	2.
4914	Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.
4915	3.
4916	Tonsillectomy.
4917	4.
4918	Right inguinal hernia repair.
4919	5.
4920	Inflammatory bowel disease.
4921	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.
4922	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.
4923	SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.
4924	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.
4925	He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.
4926	He has no children.
4927	He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.
4928	PHYSICAL EXAM:
4929	No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
4930	No gynecomastia
4931	Respiration comfortable
4932	No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs
4933	No skeletal deformity or tenderness
4934	Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
4935	Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
4936	No hernias.
4937	Normal penis, scrotum, and testes.
4938	Rectum: no mural lesion.
4939	Stool guaiac negative
4940	Prostate is small.
4941	The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.
4942	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.
4943	I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.
4944	Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.
4945	His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.
4946	On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.
4947	While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.
4948	We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.
4949	Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.
4950	Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

5105	   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:
5106	64 y.o.
5107	male with known CAD.
5108	He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
5109	At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
5110	He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
5111	He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
5112	He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA.
5113	His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
5114	He was referred for surgery.
5115	He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.
5116	He now presents with recurrent chest burning.
5117	He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG.
5118	His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest.
5119	He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis.
5120	During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test.
5121	Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds.
5122	He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved.
5123	MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility.
5124	There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct.
5125	His ejection fraction is 46%.
5126	He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.
5127	Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod.
5128	ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%.

5442	CLINIC NOTE 
5443	Victor Lujan
5444	SMH#:  018-92-33
5445	March 25, 2073
5446	DIAGNOSIS:
5447	Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.
5448	SUBJECTIVE:
5449	The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.
5450	The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.
5451	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
5452	Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.
5453	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
5454	Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.
5455	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
5456	Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.
5457	Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.
5458	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
5459	On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.
5460	Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.
5461	The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.
5462	There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.
5463	Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.
5464	However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.
5465	Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.
5466	IMPRESSION:
5467	As above.
5468	PLAN:
5469	My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.
5470	In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.
5471	It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

5489	Discharged on heart failure regimen.
5490	Developed chest pain last night, pleuritic, different than previous CP.
5491	No ECG changes noted in EW, went to Alina Medical where symptoms changed abruptly to 8/10 SSC pressure that was similar to pain experienced at VHOC admission.ECG showed biphasic TWI in anterior precordium V1-V3, and    saddle-shaped    T waves, ST elevations in II/III/aVF.
5492	Troponin mildly elevated at 0.2.
5493	Patient moved to cath lab for urgent re-look.
5494	In the cath lab, found a widely patent LAD stent with post-stend 40% eccentric plaque.
5495	D1 ostial pinch from stent.

5902	EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18
5903	Impression: 
5904	55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity.
5905	His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits.
5906	The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy.
5907	He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.
5908	Recommendations: 
5909	-   check UA, NH3
5910	-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g.
5911	with Labetalol.
5912	-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.
5913	-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity
5914	-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy
5915	This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 
5916	Thank you for this interesting consult.

5971	HPI
5972	50 yo RHM  presents after episode of L hand tingling and slurred speech.
5973	He was in his usual state of health when he woke up at 8 am.
5974	At around 10 am he told his son that he was not feeling well and went to bed.
5975	He reports that his speech was normal at that time.
5976	At 11:30 his wife called him and his speech was slurred.
5977	He was able to say real words but they were slurred and almost unintelligible.
5978	He also had L hand tingling.
5979	The slurred speech and tingling resolved at 12:15 pm.
5980	He denies weakness, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, headache, vertigo, chest pain, palpitations.
5981	One week ago, while he was on vacation in Chincoteague, he had a transient episode of slurred speech.

6376	4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
6377	other side.
6378	There was an increase in the size on the toe
6379	ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.
6380	Scant amount of
6381	drainage was noted from the toe areas.
6382	Mr. Nicholas Xavier
6383	is vigilant with his foot care and has been so.
6384	This is
6385	definite worsening of his symptoms.

6414	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
6415	returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
6416	left foot ulceration.
6417	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d.
6418	and Actos 30 mg
6419	q.d.
6420	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
6421	changed, but there are no new signs of infection.
6422	He has been
6423	taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d.
6424	for the last seven days.
6425	He denies
6426	fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
6427	little bit.
6428	His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.
6429	He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.
6430	I have
6431	asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
6432	appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
6433	vascular status.
6434	I have also reviewed with him that he may need
6435	to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.
6436	Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
6437	until the end of this month.
6438	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
6439	after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.
6440	In the meantime, he will
6441	continue with all his medications.
6442	I have given him a
6443	prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d.
6444	since the pharmacy could not
6445	give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

6458	RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594
6459	Dear Dr. Vanpelt,
6460	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 
6461	recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
6462	I followed him in the hospital 
6463	when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.
6464	As you know, he is a 77 
6465	year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 
6466	hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 
6467	lower extremity bypasses in the past.
6468	He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 
6469	for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.
6470	His preoperative evaluation 
6471	included 
6472	a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 
6473	induced 
6474	hypokinesis in the inferior wall.
6475	Since this was a small area, it was felt 
6476	he 
6477	could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.
6478	He 
6479	underwent 
6480	left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 
6481	with 
6482	no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
6483	However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
6484	35 and a troponin of 19.5.
6485	As a result of his large troponin leak, he 
6486	underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 
6487	main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 
6488	artery, 
6489	100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 
6490	posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 
6491	PDA.
6492	Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 
6493	45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.
6494	Due to 
6495	his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 
6496	on 
6497	Apr 20, 2091.
6498	He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 
6499	graft to his obtuse marginal artery.
6500	He did not have a graft to his 
6501	posterior 
6502	descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary 
6503	Nicholas-Xaviar, Fred
6504	MR #65856594
6505	Page Two
6506	to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.
6507	Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 
6508	April 
6509	27, 2091.
6510	His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 
6511	Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 
6512	morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
6513	and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.
6514	Since that time, he has done quite well.
6515	He has been progressing at 
6516	rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 
6517	per 
6518	day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 
6519	his house.
6520	He denies any chest pain with walking.
6521	He has no shortness of 
6522	breath or dyspnea on exertion.
6523	He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 
6524	long 
6525	time and this is unchanged.
6526	He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 
6527	claudication symptoms with walking at this time.
6528	He does complain of some 
6529	pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation.
6530	has 
6531	plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.
6532	On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 
6533	60.
6534	His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 
6535	without carotid bruits.
6536	His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 
6537	bilaterally.
6538	His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 
6539	rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.
6540	His 
6541	chest 
6542	incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well.
6543	has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 
6544	well.
6545	There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 
6546	does not appear to be cellulitic.
6547	His feet are warm.
6548	His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 
6549	in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 
6550	unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.
6551	In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 
6552	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 
6553	disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 
6554	three 
6555	weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.
6556	will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 
6557	time.
6558	I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 
6559	and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.
6560	I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 
6561	his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.
6562	I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 
6563	regimen so I have changed his 
6564	Page Three
6565	Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d.
6566	and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o.
6567	q.d..
6568	He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 
6569	develops 
6570	any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 
6571	concerns.
6572	He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.
6573	Thank you for 
6574	allowing me to participate in his care.
6575	Sincerely,

7157	His renal function at that time was
7158	normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.
7159	His potassium at
7160	that time was 4.6.
7161	Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.
7162	He has
7163	lost about 40 lb.
7164	He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary
7165	counseling.

7203	LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD
7204	DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD
7205	HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD
7206	however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:

7208	HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 
7209	When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month.
7210	He feels well.
7211	He says he's lost 10 lbs.
7212	since his last visit (262 lbs.
7213	on 2/26 - 263 lbs.

7236	For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.
7237	2. also poor BP control for a diabetic.
7238	Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD.
7239	It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

7241	MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

7253	Dear Dr. Truong:
7254	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
7255	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
7256	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
7257	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
7258	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
7259	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
7260	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
7261	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
7262	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
7263	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
7264	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
7265	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
7266	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
7267	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
7268	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
7269	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
7270	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
7271	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
7272	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
7273	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.

7346	Dear Bethany: 
7347	I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.
7348	Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.
7349	Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.
7350	Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.
7351	She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.
7352	She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.
7353	After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.
7354	At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.
7355	When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.
7356	She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.
7357	She has not had palpitations.
7358	She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.
7359	She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits.
7360	She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.
7361	She has not had any peripheral numbness.
7362	The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.
7363	The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner.
7364	On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.
7365	The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.
7366	Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.
7367	She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.
7368	The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.
7369	She is fully alert.
7370	The neck veins are not elevated.
7371	The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.
7372	There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.
7373	The lungs are clear.
7374	The PMI is not displaced.
7375	There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.
7376	The abdomen is benign.
7377	There is no renal artery bruit.
7378	The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.
7379	There is no tenderness of her skin.
7380	The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening.
7381	Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.
7382	The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.
7383	However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.
7384	Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.
7385	I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.
7386	Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.
7387	I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.
7388	We are pleased with the present regimen.
7389	We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.
7390	We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.
7391	I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.
7392	Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.
7393	I know that you will continue to follow her closely.
7394	I told her that I would see her again in nine months.
7395	Sincerely,
7396	______________________________

7539	CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
7540	TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.
7541	A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.
7542	Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.
7543	It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.
7544	However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.
7545	Ischemic event is less likely in this man.
7546	EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.
7547	Other possible causes include:
7548	"  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently."
7549	However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.
7550	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.
7551	Plan:
7552	"1)	Continue hydration overnight."
7553	2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.

7587	Date of Admission: 10/10/92
7588	"Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula"
7589	PCP: Estep, Willa
7590	Code status: Full
7591	CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis
7592	HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.
7593	He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.
7594	He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.
7595	He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.
7596	He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.
7597	He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.
7598	When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.
7599	One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.
7600	Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.
7601	As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.
7602	According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.
7603	He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.
7604	He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.
7605	Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.
7606	At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.
7607	In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.
7608	He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.
7609	He has had no other symptoms.
7610	Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.
7611	He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.
7612	Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.
7613	"PMH: 	- DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only."

7720	_____________________________________________________________________________________
7721	Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.
7722	Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.
7723	No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.
7724	No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.
7725	Stable Hct.
7726	Likely etiologies include:
7727	1.
7728	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.
7729	EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.
7730	Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.
7731	Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.
7732	2.
7733	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.
7734	Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.
7735	3.
7736	Prazosin-induced hypotension.
7737	In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.
7738	4.
7739	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.
7740	Plan:
7741	"Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers"
7742	"		- Telemetry"
7743	"		- 24 hr Holter monitor"
7744	"		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler"
7745	"		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m."
7746	"		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr"
7747	"		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient"
7748	"		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd"
7749	"DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m."
7750	"		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet"
7751	"OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN"
7752	"Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol"
7753	"Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc."

7946	ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     
7947	Chest xray: Clear
7948	Assessment & Plan
7949	83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting.
7950	Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features.
7951	However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain.
7952	Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s.
7953	However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion.
7954	It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.
7955	There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.
7956	Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
7957	Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
7958	Has completed MI r/o
7959	Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
7960	Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
7961	CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
7962	Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
7963	RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
7964	Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.
7965	Afebrile.
7966	Hemodynamically stable.
7967	U/A and chest xray negative
7968	Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
7969	Fen/Renal
7970	Replete Mg
7971	Proph: Lovenox, nexium

7974	Record date: 2078-11-22
7975	PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
7976	History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
7977	seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.
7978	On the last visit he was having 
7979	chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
7980	evaluation.
7981	At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
7982	ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.
7983	The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
7984	the past with a decreased LV function.
7985	However repeat echo within the 
7986	past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
7987	of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
7988	Humbert Hospital against medical advice.
7989	After being evaluated in the 
7990	Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
7991	the Internal Medicine clinic.
7992	Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
7993	Carafate 1 gm.
7994	PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
7995	q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d.
7996	p.r.n.
7997	and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.
7998	His 
7999	insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m.
8000	and 18 units q.p.m.
8001	and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.
8002	On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
8003	pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
8004	discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
8005	Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
8006	of 76.
8007	He is not in any acute distress.
8008	His chest is clear to 
8009	auscultation.
8010	His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
8011	sounds.
8012	His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.
8013	rectal exam is guaiac negative.
8014	His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
8015	pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.
8016	Assessment and Plan:  
8017	1.
8018	Cardiac.
8019	The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
8020	     to rule out ischemia.
8021	2.
8022	Hypertension.
8023	His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
8024	3.
8025	Diabetes.
8026	His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
8027	     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
8028	4.
8029	The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
8030	     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
8031	5.
8032	General.
8033	The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
8034	     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

8040	                                              7-21-79
8041	History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
8042	me.
8043	I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
8044	disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
8045	The patient has had a positive 
8046	exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
8047	that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.
8048	However, patient was 
8049	overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
8050	approximately 50 lb.
8051	at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
8052	catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.
8053	Patient was seen last night 
8054	in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
8055	which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
8056	flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.
8057	On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.
8058	His exam was 
8059	notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.
8060	His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
8061	well.
8062	His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
8063	did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.
8064	An 
8065	abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
8066	presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.
8067	IVP 
8068	was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.
8069	He was given Toradol 
8070	in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
8071	Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.
8072	I was called by 
8073	the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
8074	flank.
8075	On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
8076	brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.
8077	On exam 
8078	he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
8079	pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
8080	abdomen.
8081	Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
8082	peritoneal signs.
8083	Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
8084	pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
8085	musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
8086	feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
8087	undergo this study this afternoon.
8088	I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
8089	with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
8090	rule out pancreatitis.
8091	Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
8092	ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
8093	reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.
8094	He is also 
8095	status post cholecystectomy.
8096	I will review his IVP later today and make 
8097	further therapeutic interventions at that time.

8388	Dear Dr. Short:
8389	I did see Irene Upshur for a followup today.
8390	As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction.
8391	Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300.
8392	She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.
8393	When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it.
8394	On examination today, she otherwise appears well.
8395	Ears are unremarkable.
8396	Her eardrums are intact.
8397	She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.
8398	Her gait is normal.
8399	There is no nystagmus.
8400	An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.
8401	Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.
8402	Assessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.
8403	Plan:  She does take multiple medications.
8404	It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.
8405	I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.

8407	This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.
8408	However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil.

8625	Department of Medicine 
8626	RE: Emery, Donn 
8627	NMH#: 059-57-26 
8628	Dear Dr. Pacheco:  
8629	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently.
8630	Thank you for your kind referral.
8631	I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.
8632	Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.
8633	His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.
8634	This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.
8635	Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left.
8636	At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.
8637	Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.
8638	He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet.
8639	He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.
8640	He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems.
8641	He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.
8642	Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.
8643	Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins.
8644	He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.
8645	He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50.
8646	His glucose control by his history has been very good.
8647	He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.
8648	Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.
8649	He has no known drug allergies.
8650	He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.
8651	His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.
8652	He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.
8653	He has several children, all in good health.
8654	On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.
8655	No carotid bruits could be appreciated.
8656	The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.
8657	He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.
8658	Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.
8659	Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.
8660	The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.
8661	Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.
8662	On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.
8663	There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.
8664	Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.
8665	In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.
8666	Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.
8667	Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.
8668	There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.
8669	Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.
8670	Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.
8671	Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.
8672	There was no jaw jerk.
8673	Toes were downgoing bilaterally.
8674	Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.
8675	Those results were available for me today.
8676	They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.
8677	Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.
8678	There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.
8679	Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.
8680	With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration.
8681	There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual.
8682	In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon.
8683	The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence.
8684	I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.
8685	Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.
8686	We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.
8687	However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him.
8688	Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem.
8689	I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.
8690	If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.
8691	Once again, thank you for your kind referral.
8692	Sincerely,

8700	NMH#:  059-57-26
8701	December 29, 2096
8702	INTERVAL HISTORY:
8703	He has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis.
8704	He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. 
8705	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
8706	General:  Complaint of mild fatigue.
8707	No fevers, chills, or change in appetite.
8708	HEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness.
8709	Pulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing.
8710	Cardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations.
8711	Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.
8712	Urologic:  No dysuria, hematuria.
8713	Lymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
8714	Musculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain.
8715	Hematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting.
8716	Neurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right.
8717	He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.
8718	He has had some moderately severe back pain.
8719	REVIEW OF STUDIES:
8720	Blood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3.
8721	I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing.
8722	A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months.
8723	If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age.
8724	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
8725	Weight:  175 lb.
8726	with shoes.
8727	Blood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine.
8728	He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.
8729	Skin:  Normal.
8730	Lymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
8731	There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.
8732	Lungs:  Clear.
8733	Heart:  Normal.
8734	Abdomen:  No masses or tenderness.
8735	Extremities:  No evidence of DVT.
8736	No edema.
8737	Rectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities.
8738	IMPRESSION:  
8739	He is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone.
8740	His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall.
8741	I will see him next in six months.

8750	Patient presents today for nail care.
8751	It is an initial visit for him with me.
8752	He had seen
8753	Dr. Noah Velazquez back in July of this year.

8785	December 10, 2098  Endocrine/Diabetes
8786	Present Illness:  
8787	Asked to see this 89 year old patient of Drs.
8788	Pina and Keefe, admitted with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis and less attention to diet at the time of his wife's death last week.
8789	He is approaching probable AVR and ?
8790	CABG.
8791	He has had diabetes since age 50.
8792	He was treated with diet initially, then chlorpropamide (100 mg bid at the time of admission) to which metformin (1000 mg bid at the time of admission) was added.
8793	His recent A1c was 6.5 %.
8794	He denies hypoglycemia and does not have hyponatremia.
8795	His creatinine is 1.5.
8796	He has never used insulin until this admission, when his oral agents were stopped and Lantus begun.
8797	"Retinopathy:	Reports that he does have retinopathy, but lost vision OD to macular degeneration."
8798	He is followed by Dr. Valentine and Dr. Wilkes, and reports that he has had laser treatment by Dr. Valentine.
8799	"Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 42/1.5 "
8800	"Neuropathy:	Decreased sensation in feet and hands."
8801	Notes that he has had flat feet all of his life and does not recall any acute painful episode in L foot.
8802	"Cardiac:	above"
8803	"Vascular:	No claudication"
8804	Pre-op evaluation has included colonoscopy and EGD because of guaiac positive stool.
8805	An incidental bladder mass is suspected on the basis of pelvic CT and ?
8806	cystoscopy is also planned.
8807	Past Medical History:  
8808	"Surgery:	Lymphoma - treated with surgery and radiation therapy in 2077 or so"

8819	"Allergies:	??"
8820	Sulfa - he thinks that he has had sulfa since the time he was labeled with an allergy to it but cannot recall details.
8821	Family History:  
8822	MGF had diabetes.
8823	Social History: 
8824	His wife died last week of Alzheimer's Disease, several months following a fall.
8825	He is a Financial Senior Manager.
8826	After the successful treatment of his lymphoma at about age 68, he went back to school to study sociology.
8827	Review of Systems: above
8828	Review of systems is otherwise negative.
8829	"Physical Exam:	"
8830	Delightful elderly man in no distress.

8840	No masses.
8841	No tenderness.
8842	No palpable AAA.
8843	"Extremities:	1+ ankle edema."
8844	Pop 1-2+ R, 1+ L. No pedal pulses.
8845	R foot has small plantar arch, but L has no arch and bony prominence in the location of plantar arch; there is also some deformity of the  L ankle.
8846	"Neurological:	AJ absent."
8847	"Impressions and Plan:	"
8848	"  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes."
8849	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.
8850	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89.
8851	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him.
8852	Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect).
8853	Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper.
8854	I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice.
8855	Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind.
8856	Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.
8857	Thanks.
8858	Will follow.

9038	"	Interval History:"
9039	   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.
9040	The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.
9041	He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.
9042	The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
9043	Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.
9044	The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.
9045	Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).
9046	The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
9047	An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.
9048	The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.
9049	Past medical history:

9225	Assessment and plan:
9226	   ASSESSMENT:
9227	63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).
9228	In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.
9229	The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.
9230	PLAN:
9231	Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).
9232	Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.
9233	No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.
9234	Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.
9235	Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.
9236	Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.
9237	Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.
9238	Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.
9239	Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.
9240	Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.
9241	Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.
9242	Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.
9243	Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

9409	male who presented to Dr Barton's office on 6/18/79  with left foot pain with claudication at approximately 20 feet, L&gt;R, and constant left great toe pain.
9410	He has intermittent b/l buttock.
9411	Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today.
9412	He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which resolves with ambulation.
9413	He does not exercise but is active during the day.
9414	He also c/o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded.
9415	He was resting at the time.
9416	He took sl TNG without any improvement.
9417	This has occured 2-3 times.
9418	He denies sob, n/v, diaphoresis, syncope.
9419	CTA RUN on 6/03/79 showed multilevel disease involving both SFAs.
9420	Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR.
9421	Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal in-stent stenosis within the distal stent.
9422	One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries.
9423	AVF in the right groin.
9424	An Adenosine MIBI was performed on 6/03/79.
9425	"Exercised with arm exercises for  4' 0"", reaching 62% of MPHR."
9426	EKG negative for ischemia.
9427	Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia, EF 46%.
9428	Compared to 10/78 (done w/ exercise as opposed to adenosine) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar 49%.
9429	Today he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath.
9430	Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent.
9431	Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent.
9432	Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a 30% diffuse narrowing.
9433	Bilateral internal iliac arteries have moderately severe stenoses in the distal aspect of main branches.
9434	The left SFA has two areas of tapered stenosis up to 70% one is proximal and the other is midvessel; main popliteal is patent, but focal 75% stenosis present at distal portion prior to trifurcation.
9435	Anterior and posterial tibial vessels occluded and reconstitute at the ankle by collaterals from the peroneal.
9436	The peroneal has calcified 60% diffuse disease in the proximal segment.
9437	He therefore underwent PTA of the proximal SFA, PTA and stent to the mid SFA, DCA and PTA of distal popliteal lesion, fox hollow and PTA of proximal peroneal stenosis.
9438	He is presently being admitted to Cardiology post intervention.
9439	Past medical history:

9811	Dear Dr. Calhoun;
9812	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
9813	As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck.
9814	We.
9815	started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
9816	In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
9817	We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
9818	He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.

9850	In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer.
9851	The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
9852	I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
9853	He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.
9854	We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
9855	Please let me know if you have any questions.
9856	Yours sincerely,

9869	RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE
9870	HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75
9871	REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.
9872	DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173
9873	REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).
9874	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.
9875	He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.
9876	This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.
9877	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.
9878	He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.
9879	While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.
9880	He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.
9881	In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.
9882	On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
9883	On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.
9884	On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.
9885	Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.
9886	On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.
9887	He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69.
9888	Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).
9889	INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
9890	He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
9891	He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
9892	He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat.

10104	He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).
10105	Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.
10106	He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).
10107	He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.
10108	He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.
10109	He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.
10110	To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.
10111	However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.
10112	On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.
10113	Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.
10114	EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).
10115	He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.
10116	For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.
10117	Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.
10118	(He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)
10119	CXR by report was clear.
10120	With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.
10121	Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.
10122	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
10123	Negative in detail except as noted otherwise above.

10213	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
10214	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
10215	He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.
10216	He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.
10217	# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms
10218	- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion
10219	- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol
10220	- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs
10221	- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)
10222	- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures
10223	- Tele, replete lytes
10224	# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist
10225	- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids
10226	- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers
10227	- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 
10228	# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home.
10229	Relatively euvolemic.
10230	- Continue lasix QOD regimen
10231	- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy
10232	- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service
10233	# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house.

10326	REASON FOR ADMISSION
10327	Tailored therapy
10328	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
10329	Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures.
10330	Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.
10331	He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.
10332	He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.
10333	He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.
10334	Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.
10335	He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.
10336	He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.
10337	At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.
10338	He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.
10339	He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.
10340	He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.
10341	He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.
10342	Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.
10343	He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.
10344	He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.
10345	He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.
10346	He denies recent fevers or chills.
10347	He has no complaint of leg swelling.

10700	Head CT/CTA Head and Neck (Today): 
10701	No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, masses or large territorial infarction.
10702	Left M1 segment filling defect likely represent a thrombus which is partially occlusive given the opacification of the distal MCA 
10703	branches.
10704	This finding correlates with patient's given symptoms.
10705	EKG (Today): 
10706	CXR (Today): Large heart
10707	Assessment
10708	: 
10709	There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.
10710	Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.
10711	He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE.
10712	He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.
10713	NIHSS was zero.
10714	CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.
10715	There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.
10716	The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.
10717	He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.
10718	Plan: 
10719	- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
10720	- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
10721	- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
10722	- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
10723	- Neuro checks q4 hours
10724	- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
10725	- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
10726	- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
10727	- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
10728	- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
10729	- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.
10730	- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
10731	- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
10732	- Check blood cultures
10733	- Check chromogenic Factor X level
10734	- PT/OT evaluation
10735	- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130
10736	Thank you for this consult.
10737	Please page 90395 with any questions or concerns.

10755	He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
10756	He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.
10757	He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.
10758	He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
10759	The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
10760	The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.
10761	Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.
10762	He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
10763	He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
10764	His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.
10765	He is in atrial fibrillation.
10766	His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.
10767	His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
10768	His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.
10769	There is no hematoma or bruit.
10770	Extremities are warm and well perfused.
10771	His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.
10772	His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.
10773	His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.
10774	His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.
10775	We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o.
10776	daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
10777	daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.
10778	He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.
10779	He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
10780	daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.

10811	Dear Dr. Dill:
10812	DOB:  10/11/2082
10813	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
10814	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
10815	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
10816	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
10817	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
10818	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
10819	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
10820	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
10821	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
10822	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
10823	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
10824	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
10825	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
10826	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
10827	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
10828	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
10829	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
10830	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
10831	His weight has been stable.
10832	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
10833	His weight has remained stable.
10834	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
10835	Past Medical History:
10836	1.
10837	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
10838	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
10839	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
10840	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
10841	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
10842	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
10843	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
10844	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
10845	2.
10846	Hypertension.
10847	3.
10848	Dyslipidemia.
10849	4.
10850	Diabetes.
10851	5.
10852	Obstructive sleep apnea.
10853	6.
10854	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
10855	7.
10856	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
10857	8.?
10858	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
10859	9.
10860	Atrial fibrillation.
10861	10.
10862	Obesity.
10863	He has no known drug allergies.
10864	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
10865	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
10866	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
10867	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
10868	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
10869	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
10870	His father lived until the age of 88.
10871	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
10872	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
10873	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
10874	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
10875	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
10876	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
10877	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
10878	There is no wheezing.
10879	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
10880	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
10881	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
10882	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
10883	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
10884	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
10885	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
10886	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
10887	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
10888	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
10889	He appears to be functional class III.
10890	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
10891	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
10892	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
10893	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
10894	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
10895	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
10896	We will leave this decision to them.
10897	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
10898	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
10899	We will be in touch following the procedure.
10900	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
10901	Sincerely,

10945	He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
10946	    current symptoms of angina.
10947	He is s/p CABG and most
10948	    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.
10949	CHF.
10950	He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic
10951	    CHF.
10952	His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe
10953	    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with
10954	    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate
10955	    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial
10956	    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. 
10957	    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and
10958	    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for
10959	    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms
10960	    of orthopnea, PND or edema.

10980	    6.
10981	Diabetes mellitus.
10982	He continues on oral agents, watching
10983	    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.
10984	He does not
10985	    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
10986	    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
10987	    of hypoglycemia.
10988	Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
10989	    albumin today.
10990	7.
10991	Cerebral vascular disease.
10992	He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
10993	    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
10994	    has had no new neurologic events.
10995	His most recent carotid
10996	    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
10997	    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
10998	    today.
10999	He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.
11000	8.
11001	Hypercholesterolemia.
11002	His most recent lipid profile is
11003	    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
11004	    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
11005	Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
11006	    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past.
11007	9.
11008	Peripheral vascular disease.
11009	He continues to have bilateral
11010	    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
11011	    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
11012	    of claudication.

11019	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
11020	abdominal pain.
11021	He continues to have a rectal fistula.
11022	Last
11023	year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
11024	sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
11025	presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
11026	bleeds.
11027	He has had no recent edema in his legs.
11028	His left knee is
11029	doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
11030	muscles.
11031	He has nocturia one time per night.
11032	He has stable
11033	impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased

11180	and pain.
11181	He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
11182	Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
11183	and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.

11241	George, Rickey
11242	MRN: 1131414
11243	06/10/92
11244	REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.
11245	PROBLEMS:
11246	1.
11247	Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.
11248	Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.
11249	He was managed by multiple
11250	services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.
11251	His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
11252	with a prolonged course of fluconazole.
11253	Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
11254	effectively with carvedilol.
11255	Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
11256	hospitalization.
11257	He never had any sustained VT or VF.
11258	He was subsequently discharged home
11259	with a Life vest defibrillator.
11260	He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.
11261	He currently has no AICD or
11262	pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
11263	for his arrhythmia issues.
11264	He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.
11265	Currently
11266	his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
11267	regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.
11268	2.
11269	CHF.
11270	Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
11271	directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him.
11272	He had one episode of CHF, which
11273	was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.
11274	At the
11275	present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
11276	night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
11277	He does
11278	continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
11279	3.
11280	Coronary artery disease.
11281	Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
11282	angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
11283	4.
11284	Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.
11285	His left TKR also required removal
11286	due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.
11287	He has had no
11288	recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
11289	issues.
11290	He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
11291	down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.
11292	5.
11293	Diabetes mellitus.
11294	Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
11295	twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
11296	has been gradually decreased.
11297	He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
11298	and he reports that his fasting
11299	sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
11300	range.
11301	He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.
11302	We will check
11303	his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
11304	Page 2
11305	6.
11306	Hyperlipidemia.
11307	He continues on Lipitor.
11308	We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
11309	CPK.
11310	7.
11311	Diabetic nephropathy.
11312	He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
11313	to re-establish baseline.
11314	8.
11315	Status post CVA.
11316	Known moderate right carotid stenosis.
11317	Minimal residual dysarthria
11318	and right-sided weakness.
11319	Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.
11320	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.
11321	Was unable to get sufficient blood
11322	pressure by cuff.
11323	Pulse 60, mostly irregular.
11324	General, thin, but no distress.
11325	Lungs, clear to
11326	auscultation and percussion.
11327	Cor, distant heart sounds.
11328	No S3 appreciated.
11329	Old pacer/AICD site.
11330	No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.
11331	Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.
11332	DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.
11333	ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
11334	both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
11335	At this time, he was
11336	quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
11337	He did deny
11338	abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
11339	At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
11340	send in to me by mail.
11341	I have also sent off a CBC today.
11342	I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
11343	next visit.
11344	If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
11345	more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
11346	aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

11357	                      OFFICE NOTE
11358	  Rickey George
11359	  MR#1131414
11360	  October 05, 2092
11361	  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.
11362	PROBLEMS:
11363	  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe.
11364	Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.
11365	Treated by Dr. Randall.
11366	Underwent extensive
11367	  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
11368	  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
11369	  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
11370	  knee popliteal bypass graft.
11371	With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
11372	  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
11373	He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
11374	  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
11375	  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.
11376	Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
11377	  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
11378	  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
11379	  hospital discharge 9/9.
11380	Will recheck renal function today.
11381	Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
11382	  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.
11383	His blood sugars are now in the normal
11384	  range on no oral agents or insulin.
11385	Will need to monitor closely through rehab.
11386	CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d.
11387	of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.
11388	At the time of
11389	  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d.
11390	and not surprisingly he developed quite
11391	  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.
11392	He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
11393	  up to 60 b.i.d.
11394	but he still has significant edema.
11395	Will go back to 80 b.i.d.
11396	with close
11397	  monitoring.
11398	Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.
11399	Will hold lisinopril
11400	  for now.
11401	Close VNA follow up.
11402	COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.
11403	Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.
11404	Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
11405	  and surgery with blood loss.
11406	His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
11407	  and he was being started on Epogen.
11408	Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
11409	  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a
11410	  Page 2
11411	  week.
11412	For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.
11413	Given his
11414	  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.
11415	Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
11416	  anginal symptoms.
11417	Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.
11418	Generally weak.
11419	Home services
11420	  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
11421	  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.
11422	Social history: wife very involved with his care.
11423	Physical exam: BP 98/60.
11424	Pulse 64.
11425	Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop.
11426	No rub.
11427	Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.
11428	Multiple well healed surgical scars.
11429	Extremities: incisions in the groin.
11430	No erythema.
11431	Right groin several cm question cystic
11432	  structure beneath the incision.
11433	Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.
11434	2-3+ edema in the
11435	  extremities bilaterally.
11436	Dry gangrene left second toe.
11437	Disposition: 1.
11438	Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d.
11439	phone follow up within several days.
11440	2.
11441	Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.
11442	3.
11443	Continue Percocet for toe pain.
11444	4.
11445	Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.
11446	5.
11447	Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.
11448	In the meantime, will
11449	  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.
11450	6.
11451	Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o.
11452	q.d.
11453	Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
11454	  about end of life issues.
11455	Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
11456	  other than his single toe at this point.
11457	"He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a"
11458	  BKA.
11459	He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
11460	  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

11479	- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
11480	- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
11481	- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%
11482	He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.
11483	He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.
11484	He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.
11485	Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.
11486	No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.
11487	Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.
11488	Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.
11489	After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.
11490	Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.
11491	At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.
11492	Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.
11493	Past medical history:
11494	   - CAD - as above

11543	Plan:
11544	- cycle troponins

11559	Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
11560	artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
11561	Since the surgery she has done
11562	quite well.
11563	She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
11564	4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
11565	and also education on dietary modification.
11566	During her hospital
11567	course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
11568	ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
11569	wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
11570	She was
11571	started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
11572	She
11573	also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
11574	Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
11575	She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
11576	renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
11577	Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
11578	diuretics.
11579	Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
11580	with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
11581	She is
11582	not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
11583	of breath.
11584	She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
11585	Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
11586	Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
11587	Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
11588	q.d.,
11589	lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o.
11590	daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o.
11591	Kayexalate 15 p.o.
11592	q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
11593	q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o.
11594	q. day, Nephrocaps
11595	one tablet p.o.
11596	q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
11597	subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o.
11598	q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o.
11599	q. day and
11600	CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
11601	Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
11602	pounds.
11603	Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
11604	150/100, pulse is 80.
11605	Her skin is without any rashes or
11606	ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.
11607	Heart regular rhythm,
11608	distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
11609	Her lungs are clear,
11610	there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
11611	healed.
11612	Her extremities are without any edema.
11613	Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
11614	Diagnosis:
11615	1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
11616	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
11617	Page 2 
11618	3)   Diabetes mellitus.
11619	4)   Anemia of chronic disease.
11620	5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.
11621	6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
11622	7)   Hypertension.
11623	8)   Morbid obesity.
11624	Plan:
11625	1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
11626	She is clinically
11627	     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
11628	     or angina.
11629	Her ejection fraction significantly improved
11630	     postoperatively.
11631	I am concerned about a relatively high blood
11632	     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
11633	     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
11634	I will
11635	     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
11636	     of her potassium.
11637	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
11638	Again we'll check regular labs
11639	     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
11640	Stable.
11641	Her blood pressure have been
11642	     under fairly good control.
11643	She has also lost a significant
11644	     amount of weight over 20 pounds.
11645	Her current weight is 326
11646	     pounds.
11647	We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
11648	We'll also recheck her blood count
11649	     and follow-up.
11650	The patient is using her CPAP
11651	     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
11652	6)   Hyperkalemia.
11653	She will continue with the Kayexalate as
11654	     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
11655	     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
11656	7)   Morbid obesity.
11657	She is making good progress with her weight
11658	     loss.
11659	She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
11660	     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
11661	     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
11662	     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica
11663	Page 3 
11664	She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

11679	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
11680	evaluated by Dr. Wooten.
11681	Please see Dr. Wooten's note.
11682	The 
11683	patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
11684	days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
11685	sputum.

11701	abdomen is obese, soft.
11702	Neurologic exam is non-focal.
11703	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory 
11704	effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.
11705	EKG 
11706	is unchanged.
11707	Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time.
11708	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated.

11715	without success.
11716	The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and 
11717	the neck anatomy is difficult to assess.
11718	We are unable to 
11719	establish a line.
11720	She has a chest x-ray for rule out of 
11721	pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for

11741	MRN: 748-80-38-0
11742	07/28/70
11743	Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
11744	shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.
11745	I had added
11746	Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.
11747	However,
11748	her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
11749	increase in her BUN and creatinine.
11750	Her BUN is in the 80's, and
11751	her creatinine is about 3.4.
11752	She states her breathing has been
11753	excellent, however.
11754	She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
11755	exertion.
11756	She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
11757	having any kind of dry cough.
11758	Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
11759	q.day, Paxil 20 p.o.
11760	q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o.

11767	q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
11768	in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
11769	q.day.
11770	Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
11771	Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
11772	acute distress.
11773	Her weight is 330 pounds.
11774	This is down over 20
11775	pounds over the past month.
11776	Her blood pressure is 122/80.
11777	Her
11778	pulse is 80.
11779	Her lungs are clear.
11780	Her heart reveals distant heart
11781	sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.
11782	Her extremities are notable
11783	for the absence of lower extremity edema.
11784	Her abdomen is also
11785	noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
11786	past.
11787	Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
11788	continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
11789	the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.
11790	There is beefy red
11791	granulation tissue surrounding this.

11810	Plan:
11811	She is doing much better on
11812	higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
11813	since her last visit here about a month ago.
11814	At this point in
11815	time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
11816	given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
11817	to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
11818	and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
11819	and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
11820	telephone conversation in four days.
11821	Should she have an increase
11822	in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
11823	Stable
11824	without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.
11825	Continue current
11826	medication.
11827	She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.
11828	I strongly wanted her to go
11829	on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
11830	her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.
11831	She is
11832	planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.
11833	I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
11834	strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.
11835	Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.
11836	Stable.
11837	regimen.
11838	The plan as above is to
11839	stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days.
11840	Diabetic foot ulcer.
11841	I also gave her a duoderm dressing
11842	to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
11843	podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
11844	appropriate treatment.

12106	RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
12107	SFC#:  553-15-48 
12108	Dear Dr. Kirk:  
12109	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.
12110	He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.
12111	The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
12112	An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
12113	The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.
12114	The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.
12115	Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
12116	There was no critical carotid stenosis.
12117	He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.
12118	He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
12119	His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.
12120	It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.
12121	He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
12122	He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.
12123	Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.
12124	He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
12125	He has no symptoms of aphasia.
12126	He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.
12127	I would agree with him.
12128	He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.
12129	Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.
12130	He has not had any problems with spasms.
12131	His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
12132	He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.
12133	He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.
12134	His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
12135	He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
12136	He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
12137	He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
12138	His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.
12139	b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o.
12140	q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o.
12141	q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o.
12142	q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o.
12143	b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.
12144	He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.
12145	He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
12146	I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.
12147	He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
12148	The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
12149	The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
12150	There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.
12151	On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
12152	His blood pressure was 150/90.
12153	His language was intact.
12154	His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.
12155	He was alert and oriented.
12156	His conversation was appropriate.
12157	The visual fields were full.
12158	The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.
12159	Facial sensation was normal.
12160	There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
12161	The tongue and palate were midline.
12162	The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
12163	There was atrophy of the left biceps.
12164	There was full range of motion of the joints.
12165	The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.
12166	The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
12167	His right side was 5/5.
12168	He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
12169	His right toe was downgoing.
12170	Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
12171	I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
12172	Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
12173	He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.
12174	Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.
12175	He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
12176	I hope that this will be the case.
12177	Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.
12178	I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
12179	His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
12180	I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.
12181	I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
12182	The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
12183	I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
12184	However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.
12185	He should continue on an aspirin a day.
12186	He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
12187	I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.
12188	We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
12189	This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
12190	After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.
12191	I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
12192	I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.
12193	The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.
12194	Sincerely,

12872	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
12873	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
12874	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
12875	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
12876	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
12877	-Telemetry
12878	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
12879	-If positive will start heparin gtt
12880	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
12881	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
12882	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix
12883	-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)
12884	#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs.
12885	The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease.
12886	Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP.
12887	Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct.
12888	-f/u smear
12889	-monitor CBC
12890	#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival
12891	-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)
12892	#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose
12893	-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123
12894	-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM
12895	#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7
12896	-FSBG AC+HS
12897	-RISS AC
12898	#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.
12899	-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70
12900	-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine
12901	-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection
12902	#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response
12903	-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)
12904	#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs
12905	-Urine tox
12906	-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings
12907	-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation
12908	-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624
12909	-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital
12910	-Continue methadone while in house
12911	#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin
12912	-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)
12913	#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
12914	#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax

13034	His current blood sugar readings are fasting 95-131 but 2 hrs after meals in the afternoon and evening have ranges from 159-276. he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate.
13035	I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage.
13036	P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while.
13037	he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes.
13038	I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week.

13333	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
13334	Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.
13335	He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
13336	"While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure""."
13337	He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes.
13338	There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.
13339	"An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG."
13340	Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized.
13341	"On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels."
13342	Stent placement was not attempted.
13343	His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward.
13344	A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 
13345	ASA 81 mg
13346	Plavix 75 mg po qd
13347	Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
13348	Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
13349	Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
13350	Lipitor 40 mg po qd
13351	A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
13352	Metformin 1000 mg po bid
13353	Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital.
13354	He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes.
13355	It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:
13356	Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.
13357	Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.
13358	No chest pain was    reported.
13359	Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.
13360	The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.
13361	See exercise report for full ECG details.
13362	Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.
13363	There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.
13364	Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
13365	Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%.
13366	No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.
13367	Trace mitral regurgitation.4.
13368	Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.
13369	All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.

13443	Dear Gray:
13444	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
13445	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
13446	I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
13447	I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
13448	The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
13449	At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
13450	He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
13451	He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal).
13452	An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
13453	An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
13454	Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
13455	Since then, he has had no further episodes.
13456	ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope.
13457	He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
13458	PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).
13459	Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening.
13460	This is an Equadorian formulation.
13461	SHx:
13462	He does not drink, nor smoke.
13463	FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
13464	Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
13465	On exam, he looks well.
13466	His heart rate is in the 64.
13467	His blood pressure was 115/70.
13468	His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
13469	His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
13470	His chest was clear to auscultation.
13471	His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
13472	His abdomen was soft.
13473	Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
13474	Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
13475	In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease.
13476	He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
13477	I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.
13478	With warm regards,  
13479	Sincerely yours,

13749	Record date: 2129-05-10
13750	Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.
13751	Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.
13752	Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
13753	Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.
13754	When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
13755	Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
13756	Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
13757	Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
13758	Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.
13759	so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
13760	We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
13761	"He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
13762	OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.
13763	Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.
13764	DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.
13765	Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.
13766	UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.
13767	Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.
13768	Optho and podiatry current.
13769	Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.

13774	well controlled.
13775	Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.
13776	Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.
13777	Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.
13778	Insomnia : since service.
13779	NTI helped a little in past, not after a while.
13780	CBT might help if successful.
13781	Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.
13782	Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.
13783	Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

13790	"			Reason for visit:"
13791	   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
13792	Interval History:
13793	   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
13794	A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
13795	An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
13796	The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion.
13797	HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA.
13798	1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
13799	His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.
13800	An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
13801	Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
13802	He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
13803	(BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2.
13804	An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
13805	Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters.
13806	He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
13807	In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief.
13808	He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
13809	An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
13810	He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done.
13811	It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.
13812	Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held.
13813	He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
13814	He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
13815	Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.
13816	(2 liters NP)
13817	Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent.
13818	Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

13930	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 
13931	woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 
13932	episode on the premises.
13933	A code was called when bystanders and 
13934	medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.
13935	The 
13936	patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 
13937	Emergency Department.
13938	The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.
13939	She took her 
13940	medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 
13941	nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.
13942	Her 
13943	other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.
13944	No epigastric 
13945	pain or tenderness and no chest pain.
13946	The patient never had any 
13947	chest pain prior to her event.
13948	She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point.
13949	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 
13950	significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 
13951	migraines.
13952	MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 
13953	Calan slow release and Glucophage.
13954	ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 
13955	Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril.
13956	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.
13957	LUNGS: 
13958	Clear bilaterally.
13959	CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 
13960	murmurs.
13961	ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
13962	EXTREMITIES:  Normal.
13963	GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here.
13964	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 
13965	was 160.
13966	Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 
13967	leads.
13968	No significant ST elevations.
13969	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 
13970	year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 
13971	premises.
13972	A code was called overhead.
13973	Bystanders reported that 
13974	the patient was diaphoretic.
13975	They gave her something to drink.
13976	Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.
13977	The patient has no 
13978	complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
13979	She looks well 
13980	but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 
13981	or gallops on her electrocardiogram.
13982	The patient was made NPO 
13983	because of her cystoscopy procedure.
13984	FINAL DIAGNOSES: 
13985	1.
13986	Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 
13987	diabetes medicine this morning.
13988	2.
13989	PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.
13990	No 
13991	old electrocardiogram to compare.
13992	We need to address the PR 
13993	depressions.
13994	This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.
13995	I 
13996	would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis.
13997	3.
13998	Cardiac ischemia.
13999	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 
14000	need admission and a formal rule out.
14001	She may even need an 
14002	echocardiogram inpatient.
14003	A full work up is pending.
14004	patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 
14005	Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

14019	CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital
14020	HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.
14021	At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.
14022	As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.
14023	Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.
14024	Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.
14025	During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.
14026	At present, pt.
14027	c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.
14028	She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.
14029	Hospital Course: 
14030	MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt.
14031	was started on IV vancomycin.
14032	The bacteremic source remains unclear.
14033	TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.
14034	A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.
14035	Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.
14036	A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
14037	Back pain: Pt.
14038	c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.
14039	Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.
14040	An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.
14041	The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.
14042	No epidural extension was noted.
14043	There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.
14044	Pt.
14045	received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.
14046	As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.
14047	A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.
14048	A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.
14049	A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.
14050	Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.
14051	Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.
14052	A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.
14053	The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.
14054	An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.
14055	A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.
14056	Renal failure:  Pt.
14057	developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.
14058	Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.
14059	Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.
14060	Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.

14063	TIA:  Pt.
14064	has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.
14065	An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.
14066	This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.
14067	A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.
14068	No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.
14069	HTN: Pt.
14070	required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.

14171	Record date: 2102-12-01
14172	ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.
14173	HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.
14174	Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.
14175	Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.
14176	Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.
14177	She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.
14178	In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.
14179	She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.
14180	She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.
14181	Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.
14182	She was transferred to GCH in August.
14183	She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.
14184	She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.
14185	She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.
14186	She was discharged to rehab in mid September.
14187	She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.
14188	She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.
14189	She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.
14190	She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.
14191	The arm swelling quickly resolved.
14192	There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.
14193	She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.

14213	If normalized then will add back Lipitor.
14214	History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.
14215	2)  Hypertension.
14216	Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.
14217	3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.
14218	Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.
14219	With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.
14220	She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.
14221	INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.
14222	4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.
14223	Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.

14231	History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ?
14232	TIA left hemisphere, ?
14233	repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.
14234	On Plavix and coumadin.
14235	Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.
14236	8)  History of elevated LFT's.
14237	May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.
14238	Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

14251	HPI: 
14252	Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.
14253	Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099.
14254	She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures.
14255	She was started on Depakote for this.
14256	Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures.
14257	EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.
14258	In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope.
14259	Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.
14260	Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.
14261	When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.
14262	These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.
14263	Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.
14264	She does not recall the events herself.
14265	The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).
14266	The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.
14267	In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.
14268	She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management.
14269	The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.
14270	Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.
14271	The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.
14272	She denies fevers/chills.
14273	No chest pain, palpitations.
14274	Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.
14275	Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.

14444	EKG: Sinus at 86.
14445	Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.
14446	CXR 7/28: NAD
14447	Chest CT 4/03: 
14448	IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
14449	     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
14450	     apex.
14451	Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
14452	     tiny lung nodules seen.
14453	MRI 9/02
14454	     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
14455	     ischemia.
14456	There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
14457	     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
14458	     hole or craniotomy.
14459	There are chronic appearing, small right
14460	     cerebellar infarcts.
14461	There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
14462	     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
14463	     with small vessel ischemic change.
14464	There is FLAIR hyperintensity
14465	     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
14466	     parietal and left occipital lobes.
14467	No abnormal enhancement is
14468	     seen.
14469	The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
14470	     unremarkable.
14471	The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
14472	There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
14473	There is
14474	     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.
14475	There are
14476	     bilateral lens implants.
14477	The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
14478	     otherwise unremarkable.
14479	MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
14480	     posterior cerbral artery.
14481	There is diffuse irregularity of the
14482	     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.
14483	There is moderate
14484	     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
14485	The
14486	     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.
14487	     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
14488	     the circle of Willis.
14489	Impression:
14490	     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
14491	     predominance as described.
14492	This could represent hemorrhage, high
14493	     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
14494	     injection.
14495	Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
14496	     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.
14497	Diffuse irregularity
14498	     of the left posterior cerebral artery.
14499	These findings could be
14500	     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
14501	     vasculitis is another possibility.
14502	Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
14503	No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
14504	Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
14505	Small vessel ischemic changes.
14506	Carotid US 3/02
14507	IMPRESSIONS:

14510	MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
14511	BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.
14512	Echo    01
14513	Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
14514	    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.
14515	Left ventricular
14516	    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.
14517	There is no flattening of the
14518	    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
14519	    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
14520	    arterial pressure.
14521	There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
14522	    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
14523	There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
14524	    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
14525	There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
14526	    represent atherosclerotic change.
14527	The aortic valve is trileaflet.
14528	Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
14529	    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
14530	    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
14531	    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.
14532	There is no evident aortic stenosis
14533	    or aortic insufficiency.
14534	Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.
14535	Otherwise,
14536	    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.
14537	Normal appearing tricuspid
14538	    and pulmonary leaflets.
14539	There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
14540	    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
14541	Flow velocity could not be optimally
14542	    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
14543	    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
14544	There is no evident pericardial effusion.
14545	ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
14546	1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.
14547	History from family sounds much more like seizure.
14548	Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.
14549	Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.
14550	Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.
14551	Continue MI rule-out
14552	Repeat echo
14553	Continue telemetry
14554	EEG
14555	F/u TSH
14556	F/U UA / Ucx
14557	F/U guiac
14558	F/U neuro recs
14559	2) Hx of clot- continue coumadin

14569	Dear Dr. Mcfarland:
14570	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.
14571	As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture.
14572	Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies.
14573	She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.
14574	Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.
14575	She has had a negative cardiac stress test.
14576	PMH as above
14577	Meds: synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa
14578	Allergies: PCN, cephalosporins, vancomysin, shellfish
14579	SH: no tobacco ever.
14580	She is a professional tool maker.
14581	She has a dog

14596	PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal.
14597	There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator.
14598	The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit.
14599	Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated.
14600	Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.
14601	IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial.
14602	It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed.
14603	In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab.
14604	Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture.
14605	There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either.
14606	I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her.
14607	I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma.
14608	We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.

14685	During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.
14686	In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.
14687	He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.
14688	He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.

14690	After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.
14691	A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.
14692	After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.
14693	He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.

15377	Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg
15378	HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.
15379	He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.
15380	He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot.
15381	There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78.
15382	He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well.
15383	The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.
15384	No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.
15385	During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.
15386	The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.
15387	The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.
15388	He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.
15389	Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

15449	Physical Examination:  
15450	General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
15451	Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.
15452	On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.
15453	It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.
15454	The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.
15455	The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.
15456	No odor.
15457	There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.
15458	Distal pulses palpable.
15459	Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.
15460	There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.
15461	The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.
15462	Relevant Laboratory Values:
15463	Pending
15464	Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.
15465	This may be amenable to local flap coverage.
15466	Recommendations: 
15467	-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
15468	-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
15469	-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
15470	-Continue daily dressing changes for now.
15471	The patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.

15478	Medical Record: 8913196
15479	Attending:  Snyder
15480	History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.
15481	Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.
15482	The wound was overlying the BPG.
15483	He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.
15484	He has been followed in clinic.
15485	Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.
15486	In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.

16371	65 y/o F with colon cancer (known, surgery/GI refuse to proceduralize), ESRD on HD (M/W/F), CVA c/b severe residual speech/cognitive deficits, HTN, recurrent GIB who presents with hypotension.
16372	She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation.
16373	Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done.
16374	No report of recent GI bleeding.
16375	In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s.
16376	Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%.
16377	Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given.
16378	Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.)
16379	Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection.
16380	CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis.
16381	After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus.
16382	Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7.
16383	Patient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions.
16384	Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.
16385	When daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care.
16386	She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics.

16590	RE:  Shilpa Pickett
16591	     MR #129-53-47-3
16592	Dear Philip:
16593	I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
16594	Clinic today.
16595	Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
16596	she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
16597	chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain.
16598	She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
16599	is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
16600	position.
16601	As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
16602	of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.
16603	Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
16604	po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.
16605	Of note, she was
16606	taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.
16607	Labetalol 200
16608	mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
16609	mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
16610	On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
16611	seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12.
16612	There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.
16613	Carotids are free
16614	of bruits.
16615	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
16616	Cardiac
16617	exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.
16618	Abdomen
16619	is soft and nontender.
16620	The extremities are free of edema.
16621	Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
16622	block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
16623	In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
16624	factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
16625	increase in weight.
16626	We will be rechecking her lipid profile today.
16627	She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
16628	she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.
16629	She
16630	notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression.
16631	She has had no change in her hair or skin.
16632	For the 
16633	Pickett, Shilpa
16634	MR #129-53-47-3               -2-            October 13, 2061
16635	moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
16636	dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
16637	hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.
16638	It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
16639	Pickett' care.
16640	Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
16641	can be of help with.
16642	Sincerely,

16655	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Syncope.
16656	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Seventy-year-old female with 
16657	diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease complaining about 
16658	syncopal episode today.
16659	The patient states that over the last 
16660	couple of weeks she has had increased chest palpitations and two 
16661	weeks ago was given an event monitor which he has intermittently 
16662	worn saying it is difficult to wear during the heat wave.
16663	This 
16664	a.m. the patient had a syncopal episode while watching a 
16665	disagreement between her two grandchildren.
16666	The patient states had 
16667	no chest pain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.
16668	The patient fell to 
16669	the floor and awoke, denies incontinence or tongue biting.
16670	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery 
16671	disease, CVA.
16672	MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lasix, Lopressor, Isordil, insulin, 
16673	lisinopril, Colace, nitroglycerin sublingual, Cisapride, Prilosec.
16674	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
16675	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished female with a 
16676	Glasgow Coma Scale of 15.
16677	HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.
16678	Neck 
16679	supple without spinal tenderness.
16680	Heart regular rate and rhythm, 
16681	positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
16682	Chest is clear.
16683	Abdomen is 
16684	soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
16685	Extremities without 
16686	clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
16687	Neuro alert and oriented times three, 
16688	good motor strength throughout, sensory intact, no focality.
16689	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Syncopal episode most likely cardiac in origin.
16690	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Will admit to 
16691	monitor and rule out for MI.
16692	The patient was admitted in stable 
16693	condition.

16705	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
16706	numerous complaints.
16707	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
16708	since her upper respiratory tract infection.
16709	She had the flu in January 
16710	and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
16711	weeks ago.
16712	She states that this has severely debilitated her.
16713	She is 
16714	complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
16715	occasional dull headache.
16716	However, her main concern is her stomach and 
16717	her back.
16718	Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
16719	in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.
16720	This is different than her 
16721	reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
16722	Prilosec-Propulsid combination.
16723	She is describing some anorexia, although 
16724	she has not lost any weight.
16725	She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
16726	movements.
16727	She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.
16728	She wonders 
16729	whether this could be in gallbladder.
16730	In addition, she is continuing to 
16731	have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
16732	distribution.
16733	She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
16734	back.
16735	Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.
16736	She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.
16737	Her sugars 
16738	have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.
16739	Her blood 
16740	pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.
16741	She is saturating well.
16742	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.
16743	There was no JVD.
16744	Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ?
16745	S3 
16746	with no significant murmur.
16747	Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
16748	mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.
16749	Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.
16750	Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.
16751	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
16752	issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
16753	and cerebrovascular disease.
16754	She came in today for discussion of her 
16755	ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
16756	With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
16757	codeine, which has helped in the past.
16758	I gave her a prescription.
16759	I 
16760	warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.
16761	She should 
16762	contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
16763	steroid injection.
16764	With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
16765	postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
16766	disease.
16767	Unclear contribution from her reflux.
16768	Dr. Mario Robison 
16769	recommended elective cholecystectomy.
16770	Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
16771	being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to 
16772	page 2 
16773	consider her for the surgery.
16774	I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
16775	make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
16776	make an informed decision about the surgery.
16777	She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
16778	a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.
16779	She would probably do better 
16780	with lower blood pressure.
16781	We could consider increasing her Imdur.
16782	I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

16796	REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.
16797	Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.
16798	She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
16799	She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.
16800	She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.
16801	She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
16802	There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.
16803	She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.
16804	She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
16805	There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
16806	The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.
16807	The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
16808	She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.
16809	She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
16810	Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.
16811	She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
16812	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
16813	and atenolol 50 mg q.d.
16814	She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
16815	Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
16816	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
16817	She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
16818	Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
16819	On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.
16820	Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.
16821	Head and neck were unremarkable.
16822	Chest is clear.
16823	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
16824	PMI is normal.
16825	S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.
16826	There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
16827	There is no S3.
16828	Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
16829	Bowel sounds are normal.
16830	Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
16831	Calf site is clean without bruits.
16832	Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
16833	Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
16834	Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.
16835	Liver function tests are normal.
16836	A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.
16837	Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
16838	She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.
16839	At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.
16840	We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.
16841	She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
16842	At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

17409	"	Interval History:"
17410	   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.
17411	Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.
17412	First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.
17413	She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.
17414	She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.
17415	It gets better when she rests.
17416	She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.
17417	Her sugars are out of control.
17418	Her weight is down, nonetheless.
17419	Physical examination:
17420	-Pulse:   80
17421	-BP: 130/85  
17422	-weight:   206 lbs.
17423	-General:   Overweight.
17424	Well appearing.
17425	-Skin:   No rashes.
17426	Anicteric.
17427	-Heent:   Unremarkable.
17428	-Neck:   JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally.
17429	Carotids without bruits.
17430	-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
17431	-Cardiac:   Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete.
17432	Regular rate and rhythm.
17433	Normal S1 and split S2.
17434	Soft S4 gallop.
17435	-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta.
17436	-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
17437	Procedures:
17438	Electrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.
17439	In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
17440	Compared there is no important change.
17441	Impression:
17442	   1.
17443	Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.
17444	Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.
17445	I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.
17446	I will continue on the current medication program.
17447	2.
17448	Hypertension.
17449	Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.
17450	Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.
17451	Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.
17452	3.
17453	Lipids will be checked.
17454	I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.
17455	Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg/dL.

17562	RE:  Jennifer Vance
17563	     MR #542-66-00-3
17564	Dear Vester:
17565	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
17566	evaluation.
17567	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
17568	briefly for our records.
17569	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
17570	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
17571	significant coronary artery disease.
17572	In 2061, after a four to five
17573	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
17574	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
17575	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
17576	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
17577	inadequate results.
17578	She therefore was taken electively for
17579	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
17580	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
17581	She subsequently continued to
17582	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
17583	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
17584	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
17585	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
17586	The catheterization
17587	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
17588	artery graft.
17589	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
17590	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
17591	She recently has undergone an
17592	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
17593	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
17594	Trials
17595	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
17596	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
17597	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
17598	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
17599	She had no
17600	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
17601	Over the past two weeks
17602	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
17603	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
17604	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
17605	The pain is not
17606	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
17607	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
17608	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a
17609	cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.
17610	Vance, Jennifer
17611	MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069
17612	Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin
17613	dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's
17614	contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.
17615	Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,
17616	NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.
17617	Allergies:  None.
17618	Cigarettes - none.
17619	Ethanol - social.
17620	Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,
17621	mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one
17622	brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother
17623	dying from melanoma age 36.
17624	The rest of her siblings and children
17625	have not heart disease.
17626	Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.
17627	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,
17628	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.
17629	The neck is
17630	supple.
17631	JVP flat.
17632	Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
17633	greater than left bruits.
17634	Chest is clear.
17635	Cardiac exam shows a
17636	normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection
17637	murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant
17638	diastolic murmur.
17639	The abdomen is benign.
17640	Extremities reveal no
17641	appreciable edema.
17642	Peripheral pulses are intact.
17643	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
17644	PR interval
17645	of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.
17646	There are minor
17647	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
17648	Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
17649	variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and
17650	dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
17651	She has had a
17652	retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
17653	most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
17654	significant provokable ischemia.
17655	Nonetheless, I am concerned that
17656	her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
17657	I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
17658	I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
17659	studies.
17660	In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
17661	dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive
17662	antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
17663	Unless her variegata porphyria
17664	precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po
17665	q.d.
17666	I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
17667	In
17668	addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d.
17669	and
17670	I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
17671	porphyria does not 
17672	MR #542-66-00-3                    -3-            July 18, 2069
17673	preclude this.
17674	She understands that if she has evidence for
17675	significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
17676	to undergo repeat coronary angiography.
17677	Thank you very much for
17678	allowing me to assist in her care.

17848	College Station, NC 22169
17849	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
17850	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
17851	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
17852	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
17853	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
17854	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
17855	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
17856	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
17857	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
17858	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
17859	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
17860	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
17861	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
17862	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.
17863	Past medical history:
17864	   Hypertension.
17865	Hyperlipidemia.
17866	CAD.

17889	-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress
17890	-Heent:   Benign
17891	-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits
17892	-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs
17893	-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
17894	S1 and S2.
17895	There is no murmur, rub, or gallop
17896	-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.
17897	There are no masses or bruits appreciated
17898	-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.
17899	Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.
17900	Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration
17901	-BP: 145/80    on the right
17902	"	Other Data:"
17903	   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.
17904	Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.
17905	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
17906	Assessment and plan:
17907	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
17908	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
17909	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
17910	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
17911	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
17912	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
17913	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
17914	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
17915	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
17916	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
17917	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
17918	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
17919	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
17920	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
17921	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
17922	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

18058	RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.
18059	Dear Dr. Cooper:
18060	  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes.
18061	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
18062	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
18063	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
18064	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
18065	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
18066	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
18067	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
18068	He returns today for review.
18069	He remains in reasonable health.
18070	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
18071	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
18072	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
18073	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
18074	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.
18075	Past medical history:
18076	   CAD

18174	I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS.
18175	I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.
18176	I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.
18177	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.
18178	Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG.
18179	He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors.
18180	but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.

18426	      Assessment and plan:
18427	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
18428	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
18429	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
18430	Problems:
18431	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
18432	Takes it about once/month.
18433	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
18434	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
18435	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
18436	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
18437	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
18438	Continue her present dose of statin.
18439	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
18440	Continue her current regimen.

18461	Chief Complaint
18462	Dyspnea and exertional chest discomfort 
18463	History of Present Illness
18464	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
18465	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
18466	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
18467	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
18468	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
18469	He presents now for cath and surgery.

18563	Assessment
18564	58-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM, HTN  and ESRF on dialysis.
18565	In addition he has ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by severe mitral regurgitation.
18566	He has been reluctant to consider surgery in the past but in the face of worsening symptoms has now agreed to proceed.
18567	Plan
18568	1.
18569	Admit for right and left heart cath with cors.

18574	Record date: 2067-08-02
18575	60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.
18576	It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.
18577	He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.
18578	He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.
18579	In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.
18580	Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.
18581	He was discharged without clear follow-up.
18582	The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.
18583	He has been ambulating on the wound.
18584	He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.
18585	He reports no pain.
18586	Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.
18587	Review of systems is otherwise negative.

18726	Case discussed in detail .
18727	This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia.
18728	Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA.
18729	He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up.
18730	At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance.
18731	At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.
18732	The patient's wound has currently not been closed.
18733	He has a vac dressing in place.
18734	He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology.

18796	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
18797	Assessment/Plan
18798	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
18799	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
18800	S/P Rt TMA.
18801	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
18802	By issue:
18803	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
18804	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
18805	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
18806	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
18807	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
18808	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
18809	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
18810	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
18811	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
18812	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
18813	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
18814	Might hold ranitidine as well.
18815	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
18816	Currently on olanzapine.
18817	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
18818	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
18819	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
18820	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
18821	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
18822	Would seek ID input to the end.
18823	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
18824	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
18825	Recs per nephrology
18826	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
18827	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
18828	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
18829	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
18830	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
18831	Thanks,

19043	Dear Dr. Huerta:
19044	Reason for visit:
19045	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
19046	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
19047	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
19048	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
19049	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
19050	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
19051	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
19052	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
19053	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
19054	The patient has been managed medically since then.
19055	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
19056	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
19057	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
19058	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
19059	His weight has been up and down.
19060	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
19061	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
19062	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
19063	Past medical history:
19064	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
19065	Current Medications:
19066	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
19067	 Glucophage 1 g BID
19068	 glyburide 10 mg BID

19075	 Avandia 8 mg QD
19076	Allergies:
19077	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
19078	Family history:
19079	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
19080	Social history:
19081	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
19082	Review of systems:
19083	   As above, otherwise negative.
19084	Physical examination:
19085	-Pulse:   60
19086	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
19087	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
19088	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
19089	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
19090	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
19091	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
19092	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
19093	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
19094	Selected recent labs:
19095	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
19096	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
19097	Assessment and plan:
19098	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
19099	He is doing well.
19100	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
19101	He is currently not anticoagulated.
19102	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
19103	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
19104	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
19105	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
19106	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
19107	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
19108	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
19109	Changes to Medications this visit

19269	CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation.
19270	HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter.
19271	Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR.
19272	Pt did well post cardioversion.
19273	He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis.
19274	Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically.
19275	Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology.
19276	He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter.
19277	Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73.
19278	The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm.
19279	He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

19452	NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly
19453	MRN:      3299811 
19454	INITIAL VISIT 
19455	This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit.
19456	The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
19457	recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
19458	syndrome and back/chest pain.
19459	Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
19460	She was found to have a blood
19461	pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
19462	headaches.
19463	She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
19464	found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
19465	She was transferred to the
19466	Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic
19467	convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam.
19468	She also suffered a urinary tract
19469	infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.
19470	She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,
19471	at which time she was awake but unable to give a history.
19472	On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of
19473	127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.
19474	She had a myxedematous face and
19475	was obese.
19476	She was cardiovascularly stable.
19477	Neurologically, she was able to move
19478	all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.
19479	Cranial nerves
19480	intact.
19481	Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to
19482	elevated blood pressure.
19483	Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy.
19484	Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar
19485	puncture, both of which were negative.
19486	Electroencephalogram was  performed and
19487	showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
19488	The patient's
19489	alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.
19490	She had
19491	an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral
19492	leads.
19493	Acute cardiac event was ruled out.
19494	The patient underwent a course of
19495	physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
19496	A
19497	specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
19498	this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
19499	use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
19500	threshold for seizure activity.
19501	Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.
19502	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,
19503	panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone

19580	HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days.
19581	Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission.
19582	As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days.
19583	They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused.
19584	The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day.
19585	On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night.
19586	She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.
19587	The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.
19588	The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.
19589	She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.

19597	Angina pectoris - negative stress 
19598	Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH.
19599	Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.
19600	Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis
19601	Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT

19948	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
19949	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
19950	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.
19951	Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

20351	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
20352	gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
20353	post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
20354	1.
20355	He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.
20356	These are 
20357	improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
20358	128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
20359	ranging from 150 to 190.
20360	He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
20361	units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
20362	at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.
20363	He has not had any 
20364	further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
20365	seems to be sticking more to the diet.
20366	He has however gained some 
20367	weight, which is a little disconcerting.
20368	He does attend a podiatrist 
20369	and is doing well from that perspective.
20370	He is to return to the 
20371	ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.
20372	He 
20373	missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
20374	follow-up with nutrition at this time.
20375	2.
20376	Cardiovascular.
20377	He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
20378	atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.
20379	Further question regarding his stroke back 
20380	in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
20381	unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
20382	to have a hole in his heart at that time.
20383	He was eventually stopped off 
20384	Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
20385	put on Coumadin for life at that point.
20386	He had an aborted myocardial 
20387	infarction in 2067.
20388	He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
20389	exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
20390	yards before getting very short of breath.
20391	He has no orthopnea or PND.
20392	He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
20393	3.
20394	Health maintenance.
20395	We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
20396	flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.
20397	has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
20398	his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
20399	checked on the day prior to the test.
20400	This will be scheduled by our 
20401	secretary.
20402	He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
20403	standard dose and titrate up slowly.
20404	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
20405	Lipitor.
20406	Page 2
20407	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.
20408	He is tachycardic 
20409	at 98 beats per minute.
20410	Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
20411	sided cataract.
20412	Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.
20413	The 
20414	abdominal examination is also normal.
20415	His injection sites were clean 
20416	and without erythema.
20417	There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
20418	his feet appeared well.
20419	We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
20420	including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.
20421	PLAN:
20422	Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
20423	including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
20424	and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
20425	I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
20426	left the other doses as is.
20427	I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
20428	and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
20429	4.
20430	We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
20431	5.
20432	I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
20433	above for colorectal cancer screening.
20434	6.
20435	Return to see in a week's time, understands.
20436	He can discuss any 
20437	management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

21291	  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.
21292	History of present illness
21293	  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.
21294	Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.
21295	He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.
21296	At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.
21297	He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.
21298	He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.
21299	He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.
21300	He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.
21301	He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.
21302	He is here for a followup.
21303	Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.
21304	His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

21398	Assessment and plan
21399	  The patient's multiple issues were reviewed with the patient in detail.
21400	His weight has remained fairly stable on the lower dose of diuretics, and a repeat BUN and creatinine were sent today.
21401	He was volume depleted at his last visit.
21402	Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.
21403	His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.
21404	His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.
21405	His weight control has been a problem.
21406	He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.
21407	He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

21605	Reactions to Medicines: None
21606	Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness
21607	History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.
21608	He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
21609	In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
21610	He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
21611	On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.
21612	He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.
21613	He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.
21614	ROS:Const.-Negative
21615	Eyes -Negative
21616	ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss
21617	CV: See above
21618	Respiratory: Sleep apnea
21619	GI -.
21620	Recent constipation  
21621	GU -Impotence.
21622	Urgency and incontinence  
21623	MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.
21624	Considering knee replacement
21625	Skin - Negative
21626	Neuro -CVA in past.
21627	Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.
21628	Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa
21629	Endocrine -  Diabetes
21630	Heme-No blood problems
21631	Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye
21632	Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
21633	He has no other major illnesses.
21634	He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.
21635	Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.
21636	Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
21637	Two sisters are living without diabetes.
21638	Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.
21639	He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.
21640	His significant other works as an optician.
21641	She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.
21642	Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
21643	BP 100 50/65.
21644	His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.
21645	He has no rales.
21646	He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.
21647	He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
21648	EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA
21649	Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
21650	He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
21651	In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
21652	I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
21653	I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
21654	Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
21655	I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
21656	Of course the catheterization will determine that.
21657	He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

21809	 MANAMANA nfectious Disease Consultation Note
21810	Patient: Vincent Ware (71417347     2Y)
21811	Student:  Casey Best, MS-4
21812	ID Fellow: Tina Isaiah-Villagomez MD
21813	ID Attending: Alexander Y Xian MD
21814	Referring Physician: Webster MD
21815	Date of Consult: September 20, 2073
21816	Reason for consult:  cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant
21817	HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.
21818	He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.
21819	He was free of disease since then until May 2073.
21820	He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).
21821	His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.
21822	He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.
21823	His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.
21824	It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.
21825	And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.
21826	He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).
21827	In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.
21828	In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.
21829	On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.
21830	CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.
21831	Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.
21832	He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.
21833	He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.
21834	He denies SOB (unless he   s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain.

21896	      IMPRESSION: Chest PA and lateral views are compared to prior  done on 9/18/2073.
21897	Paramediastinal opacification is changed.
21898	Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable.
21899	Nodular opacity in the  left perihilar region appears less apparent.
21900	No new consolidations are seen.
21901	There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC.
21902	No pneumothorax is seen .
21903	Impression:
21904	66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.
21905	The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.
21906	Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.
21907	However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.
21908	Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.
21909	While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.
21910	I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.
21911	My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.
21912	An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).
21913	Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.
21914	We recommend the following work-up:
21915	-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
21916	-Induced sputum for
21917	-PCP
21918	-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
21919	-Fungal stain and culture
21920	-Urine histo antigen
21921	-Serum cryptococcal antigen
21922	-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
21923	-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture
21924	If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.
21925	It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).
21926	Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.
21927	Thank you for this consult.
21928	Our team will follow with you

22138	He has not yet had documented fevers in the hospital, but his rhinorrhea after sick contact during this season is suggestive of a viral syndrome.
22139	He has chronically mildly elevated LFTs which are stable.
22140	He has a new mild eospinophila of unclear etiology.
22141	-nasopharyngeal swab AND pertussis IgM/IgG for pertussis given persistent cough and low grade temps
22142	-f/u respiratory viral panel
22143	-given mild eosinophilia, can check strongyloides antibody and stool for ova and parasites though no clear exposure history, would also check urinary histo Ag and cocciodes IgM/IgG (given old granulomatous disease on chest CT)
22144	-would consider AM cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficiency 
22145	-would repeat hepatitis serologies (HepB sAG, cAB, sAB, HepA AB, HepC Ab) given persistent mildly elevated LFTs

22206	The patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on
22207	08/15/2087.
22208	The patient was seen by Dr. Kaminski.
22209	I have discussed
22210	the management with her.
22211	I have also seen the patient personally
22212	and reviewed the medical record.
22213	This is an addendum to the
22214	medical record.
22215	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female who is
22216	sent in by her primary doctor after having had EKG changes today.
22217	Her history, which I personally obtained and in review of the
22218	record, she has a history of sarcoidosis, recently has had
22219	increased cough and some shortness of breath, given albuterol
22220	with symptomatic improvement yesterday and returned today with
22221	some persistent pain, which she says is generally related to
22222	cough.
22223	She has had no fevers, chills, or shortness of breath.

22272	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
22273	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Heart is racing.
22274	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female
22275	with history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and sarcoid, who
22276	presents with onset one hour prior to admission of left arm
22277	pressure and heart racing.
22278	The patient denies shortness of

22283	Tonight, they
22284	lasted for approximately 30 minutes prior to calling EMS.
22285	En
22286	route EMS took 12-lead ECG showing a rate of 150, suspected a
22287	flutter and was given 20 mg diltiazem by EMS with no response.
22288	She describes feeling in her left arm as dull pain, it is 3/10,
22289	and it has not made better or worse by anything.
22290	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.

22296	FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.
22297	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged African-American woman,
22298	awake, alert, and in mild distress.
22299	Exam limited by obesity.
22300	Exam is significant for neck; normal to inspection, supple,
22301	nontender, and unable to appreciate JVP.
22302	Respiratory:  No
22303	distress.

22306	ejection murmur, no gallop, and no friction rub.
22307	Abdomen:  Soft,
22308	nontender, no organomegaly, and no masses, otherwise, as
22309	documented on the paper chart.
22310	IMAGING STUDIES:  ECG shows a flutter at 150 beats per minute in
22311	ECG #1.
22312	ECG final shows a sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats
22313	per minute with no signs of ischemia.
22314	IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history
22315	of occasional brief palpitations now with one hour of continuous
22316	palpitations and ECG consistent with atrial flutter.
22317	She was
22318	given 20 mg of diltiazem IV by EMS.
22319	In the Emergency Department,
22320	she was given 20 mg without significant response, followed by 40
22321	mg ID and was achieved a good response.
22322	As the patient required
22323	a significant amount of diltiazem to slow her rate and convert
22324	her and she is also feeling somewhat nervous, we will keep her in
22325	the Observation Unit overnight.
22326	She should get an oral dose of
22327	diltiazem overnight.
22328	She should get cardiac monitoring in the
22329	morning.
22330	PLAN:  To discuss with KEKELA Cardiology and obtain consultation as
22331	to possible discharge on beta-blockers versus calcium channel
22332	blockers.
22333	If the patient does not have a new symptoms she would
22334	be stable for discharge in the morning.
22335	PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular
22336	response.
22337	SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left arm pain.

22348	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female
22349	with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and
22350	atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of
22351	sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.
22352	She
22353	said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.
22354	She also
22355	said it felt like a burning.
22356	She had mild shortness of breath
22357	and left arm achiness.
22358	She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers
22359	or chills.
22360	She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no
22361	syncope.
22362	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,
22363	and atrial fibrillation.
22364	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.
22365	SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.
22366	FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.
22367	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.
22368	MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,
22369	aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.
22370	ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.
22371	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,
22372	respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters.
22373	The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,
22374	talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.
22375	ENT: 
22376	Atraumatic, normal to inspection.
22377	Eyes are normal.
22378	Neck: 
22379	Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.
22380	Respiratory:  Clear
22381	to auscultation bilaterally.
22382	Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
22383	rhythm.
22384	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
22385	GI:  Abdomen is soft and
22386	nontender.
22387	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
22388	Back is nontender.
22389	Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema.
22390	Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.
22391	Mood and affect is normal.
22392	Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.
22393	No motor or
22394	sensory deficits.
22395	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about
22396	150, unclear.
22397	It seemed that there was T waves in V3.
22398	There is
22399	no evidence of ST elevation MI.
22400	We thought this could be an SVT.
22401	It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.
22402	Our
22403	plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement.
22404	Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal
22405	sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was
22406	clear that there was T waves.
22407	At this point, we decided to give
22408	her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.
22409	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium
22410	3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,
22411	glucose 268.
22412	ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,
22413	total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,
22414	calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.
22415	White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit
22416	42.7, and platelets 438, 000.
22417	INR is 1.
22418	UA is negative for
22419	infection with trace blood present.
22420	PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient
22421	had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.
22422	If both of
22423	those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home
22424	from the ED Observation Unit.
22425	It is unclear the etiology of her
22426	arrhythmia.
22427	It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke
22428	spontaneously.
22429	The patient is to follow up with her primary
22430	doctor.
22431	DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.
22432	CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.
22433	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,
22434	reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,
22435	discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the
22436	patient.

22444	Record date: 2062-10-30
22445	54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.
22446	Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.
22447	He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.
22448	Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.
22449	He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.
22450	He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.
22451	So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.
22452	"After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions."
22453	Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.
22454	This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.
22455	He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.
22456	He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.
22457	He walks with a walker.
22458	He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.
22459	He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.
22460	He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.
22461	He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.
22462	He reports good glycemic control.

22499	Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.
22500	Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.
22501	Plan:
22502	1) continue posaconazole
22503	2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection
22504	3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.
22505	Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.
22506	Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.
22507	He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.
22508	Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.
22509	On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.
22510	ECG without QTc prolongation.
22511	Abdomen is bening.
22512	Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

22522	The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse.
22523	Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill.
22524	The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment.
22525	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit.
22526	The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.
22527	Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand.
22528	He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight.

22783	Chief Complaint: fistula clot
22784	History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.
22785	The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.
22786	"The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that ""the access had collapsed."""
22787	On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.
22788	At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.
22789	Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.
22790	Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.
22791	"ROS: No fever/chills, HA, SOB, CP, N/V/D (though states that stomach sometimes ""sensitive"")."

22912	She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.
22913	Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.
22914	Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U/A.
22915	She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064.
22916	An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.
22917	She is currently well with no complaints.
22918	She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.
22919	She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.
22920	When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.
22921	She's not had this recently.
22922	She also does not check her BP at home.
22923	She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.
22924	She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.

23180	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.
23181	In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.
23182	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.
23183	She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.
23184	She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.
23185	Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.
23186	At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.
23187	She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.
23188	She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.
23189	She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.
23190	Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.
23191	An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.
23192	She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.
23193	The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.
23194	Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.
23195	Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.
23196	She denies dysuria.
23197	The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.
23198	At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.
23199	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.
23200	Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.
23201	Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
23202	Random fingerstick glucose is 202.
23203	Extraocular movements are full.
23204	The thyroid is not enlarged.
23205	The neck veins are flat.
23206	The chest is clear to auscultation.
23207	The breasts are free of masses.
23208	There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
23209	The heart sounds are regular.
23210	There are no rubs or gallops.
23211	There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.
23212	There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.
23213	No other masses are palpable.
23214	The lower extremities are free of edema.
23215	I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.
23216	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
23217	She has not been compliant with her medications.
23218	She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.
23219	She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.
23220	She continues to consume three or four beers a day.
23221	The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.
23222	Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.
23223	Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.
23224	I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.
23225	I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
23226	q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
23227	q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.
23228	q.d.
23229	She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.
23230	I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.
23231	I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.
23232	She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.
23233	An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

23431	MRI/MRA head and neck:
23432	Not yet completed.
23433	Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:
23434	The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are
23435	"	intact."
23436	Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at
23437	"	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere."
23438	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.
23439	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.
23440	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not
23441	"	associated with significant stenosis."
23442	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum
23443	"	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the"
23444	"	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen."
23445	There is narrowing
23446	"	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of"
23447	"	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as"
23448	"	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence."
23449	Old CT brain 6/16/89:
23450	Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are
23451	"	not uncommon for a patient of this age."
23452	There are no regions of
23453	"	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction."
23454	Basal
23455	"	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar"

23459	_______________________________________________________________
23460	IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.
23461	She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).
23462	She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.
23463	Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.
23464	While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.
23465	She had persistent nausea and vomiting.
23466	Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.
23467	She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.
23468	Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.
23469	She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.
23470	She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.
23471	She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.
23472	While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.
23473	Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.
23474	RECOMMENDATIONS:
23475	1.
23476	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms
23477	2.
23478	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).
23479	3.
23480	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.
23481	Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.
23482	4.
23483	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen
23484	5.
23485	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s
23486	6.
23487	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).
23488	7.
23489	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.
23490	This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

23502	Milbank, MN 49757   
23503	Dear Dr. Pearson: 
23504	I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning.
23505	Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis.
23506	She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent.
23507	Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.
23508	Interval History
23509	Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago.
23510	She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair.
23511	She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties.
23512	Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy.
23513	According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year.
23514	Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96.
23515	Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months.
23516	A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma.
23517	This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent.
23518	"She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters."
23519	Her other children have not maintained close contact.
23520	Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time.
23521	Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094.
23522	Past Medical History
23523	type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
23524	h/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding 
23525	hyperlipidemia 
23526	peripheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left
23527	left internal carotid artery stenosis
23528	Medications (confirmed)
23529	Baclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID 
23530	Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 
23531	Gabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS 
23532	Metoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC 
23533	Mirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS 
23534	Multivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days
23535	Novolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS 
23536	Omeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD 
23537	Toprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD 
23538	Allergies
23539	NKA 
23540	Social History
23541	Mrs. Trent is originally from Suriname.
23542	She is widowed, with six living children.
23543	A son died at age 42 in August, 2095.
23544	Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking.
23545	She does not consume alcohol.
23546	She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.
23547	Review of Systems
23548	Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination.
23549	Positive for frequent nighttime awakening.
23550	"Appetite has been ""o.k."""
23551	Exam
23552	Blood Pressure 128/58     Heart Rate 76
23553	Neck: no carotid bruits
23554	Lungs: CTA bilaterally
23555	Heart: regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur
23556	ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present
23557	EXT: no edema
23558	MS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact.
23559	Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect.
23560	"Oriented to ""LCC"" in ""Galena,"" ""March 2095."""
23561	Speech fluent in Dutch.
23562	Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand.
23563	Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail.
23564	CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm.
23565	EOMI.
23566	Mild right UMN facial weakness.
23567	Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
23568	MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg.
23569	Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension).
23570	5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg.
23571	SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left.
23572	DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left.
23573	Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally.
23574	Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.
23575	CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger.
23576	MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 
23577	CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.
23578	CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel
23579	Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.
23580	Impression
23581	Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094.
23582	Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque.
23583	She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now.
23584	Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression.
23585	Plan
23586	1.
23587	We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
23588	2.
23589	We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control.
23590	Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
23591	3.
23592	Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy.
23593	Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl.
23594	I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time.
23595	4.
23596	I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep.
23597	After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
23598	5.
23599	Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.
23600	It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you.
23601	Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues.
23602	Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.
23603	Sincerely,

23917	RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
23918	MR #863-35-65-5
23919	Dear Dr. Faust: 
23920	Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
23921	Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
23922	Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
23923	it now for our records.
23924	Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
23925	at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
23926	health until the past year.
23927	He denies any prior history of
23928	hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
23929	childhood illnesses or malignancy.
23930	He describes his usual baseline
23931	health as excellent.
23932	He is a religious walker, walking multiple
23933	times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast.
23934	Dr.
23935	Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
23936	was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia.
23937	This was treated with
23938	Metformin.
23939	Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
23940	apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
23941	he has been diagnosed with hypertension).
23942	He subsequently developed
23943	diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
23944	subsequently reduced in dose.
23945	In June of the past year the patient
23946	was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
23947	Hydrochlorothiazide.
23948	At that time he also was found to have lower
23949	extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
23950	The patient states in September of 2119 he
23951	traveled to trinidad and tobago.
23952	While in trinidad and tobago he had a
23953	marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
23954	found it difficult to ambulate.
23955	He denied any difficulty with chest
23956	pains or shortness of breath.
23957	He had no hemoptysis and no focal
23958	unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
23959	during the trip.
23960	He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
23961	ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
23962	significantly.
23963	However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
23964	medication and it was stopped.
23965	Subsequently his lower extremity has
23966	once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
23967	Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn.
23968	At the present
23969	time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath.
23970	He
23971	still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any 
23972	Page 2
23973	limitation.
23974	He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
23975	in his lower extremities.
23976	He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
23977	sputum production, no hemoptysis.
23978	He has no fevers or chills.
23979	believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
23980	months.
23981	He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation.
23982	denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
23983	that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
23984	often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him.
23985	denies any history of snoring.
23986	He has noted no new joint complaints
23987	although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
23988	his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm.
23989	This has been
23990	present for approximately two or three months.
23991	Other than that he
23992	believes his bowel and bladder function is normal.
23993	Review of
23994	systems is otherwise unremarkable.
23995	His past medical history is significant for:
23996	     1.
23997	Type II diabetes as above.

24009	compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently.
24010	Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
24011	Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus.
24012	Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
24013	immigrant from trinidad and tobago.
24014	He has been living in Haleyville
24015	since the early 2059's.
24016	He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo.

24036	This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
24037	increase in his heart rate to 100.
24038	HEENT exam is significant for a
24039	clear oropharynx.
24040	Sclera are white.
24041	Conjunctiva are minimally pale.
24042	Page 3
24043	The thyroid gland is normal.
24044	Jugular venous distention to
24045	approximately 10 cm.
24046	was noted.
24047	Neck was supple.
24048	Examination of the
24049	chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
24050	at both bases.
24051	There was no egophony and no wheezes.
24052	Otherwise the
24053	lungs were clear.
24054	Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
24055	normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated.
24056	No RV heave
24057	or lift was appreciated.
24058	No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
24059	The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced.
24060	No appreciable
24061	murmurs were detected.
24062	The point of maximum impulse was in the
24063	anterior axillary line.
24064	Examination of the abdomen revealed a
24065	nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
24066	below the right costal margin.
24067	This was nontender and smooth.
24068	Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well.
24069	Normal bowel
24070	sounds were present.
24071	Examination of the extremities reveal three
24072	plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
24073	extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
24074	extremities.
24075	No clubbing was noted.
24076	There were no skin changes
24077	consistent with collagen vascular disease.
24078	Multiple follicular
24079	lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
24080	well as on the left arm.
24081	Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.
24082	Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
24083	white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
24084	Differential was not remarkable.
24085	LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
24086	most recently 22.
24087	A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
24088	protein.
24089	No reportive cast was made.
24090	A CEA was notable for a level
24091	of 2.4 on 1/05/20.
24092	An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
24093	demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
24094	LV function.
24095	The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
24096	hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function.
24097	There was trace
24098	MR with moderate TR.
24099	A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
24100	right atrial pressure was noted.
24101	In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
24102	pulmonary hypertension.
24103	The etiology of this is not clear at the
24104	moment.
24105	Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
24106	disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
24107	sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease.
24108	In addition some
24109	patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
24110	setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
24111	ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
24112	exclusion.
24113	The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
24114	with increasing his diuretic regimen.
24115	I'm embarking on a course of
24116	evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.
24117	In specific he will
24118	be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
24119	disease this afternoon.
24120	This has already been arranged by Dr.
24121	Faust.
24122	In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
24123	antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70.
24124	I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
24125	Page 4
24126	to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.
24127	will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
24128	pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
24129	arterial blood gas drawn.
24130	If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
24131	he may require more invasive diagnostics.
24132	I've already consulted
24133	formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
24134	experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
24135	be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
24136	workup is nondiagnostic.
24137	Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
24138	I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
24139	his diagnostic tests have been performed.
24140	Please do not hesitate to
24141	call me with any further questions or concerns.
24142	Sincerely,

24458	Dear Hicks,
24459	I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
24460	She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.
24461	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
24462	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
24463	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
24464	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
24465	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
24466	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
24467	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
24468	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
24469	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
24470	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
24471	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
24472	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
24473	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
24474	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
24475	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
24476	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
24477	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
24478	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
24479	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
24480	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
24481	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
24482	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
24483	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
24484	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
24485	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
24486	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
24487	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
24488	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
24489	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
24490	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
24491	Her abdomen is benign.
24492	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
24493	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
24494	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
24495	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
24496	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
24497	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
24498	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
24499	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
24500	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
24501	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
24502	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
24503	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
24504	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
24505	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
24506	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
24507	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
24508	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
24509	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
24510	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
24511	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
24512	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
24513	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
24514	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
24515	Sincerely,

24532	Dear Dr. Schmidt:
24533	Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.
24534	As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.
24535	She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.
24536	She has done well since the procedure.
24537	She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.
24538	She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.
24539	She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.
24540	On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.
24541	She is alert and oriented x3.
24542	She appears grossly neurologically intact.
24543	Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.
24544	Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.
24545	This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.
24546	It remains superficial.
24547	She has no other ischemic skin changes noted.
24548	I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.
24549	She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.
24550	She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.
24551	I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.
24552	She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.
24553	She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen.
24554	If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.

24640	52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.
24641	On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.
24642	In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.
24643	The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.
24644	- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin
24645	- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan
24646	- NPO from midnight, pepcid
24647	- check chem7, CBC, coags
24648	- has an insulin pump
24649	- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

24735	of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.
24736	Given the
24737	erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this
24738	vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of
24739	vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed
24740	outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting
24741	her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.
24742	The patient's
24743	erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be
24744	extremely atypical for a DVT.
24745	We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is
24746	followed closely by Surgery and this notification was
24747	made at 8:30 p.m.
24748	Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point
24749	we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she
24750	does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she
24751	needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on
24752	maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the
24753	hospital.
24754	DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.
24755	CONDITION:  Stable.
24756	DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

24815	Please see the written documentation undertaken by Dr. Caldwell,
24816	the resident who saw the patient primarily.
24817	I have seen and
24818	examined the patient personally, reviewed the written
24819	documentation and agree with the assessment and plan.
24820	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Wilkerson is a 68-year-old
24821	gentleman without significant past medical history, who is
24822	actually being seen here by his primary care physician who
24823	happens to be a resident rotating ____ normally sees him in MIMAIMA
24824	Clinic.
24825	According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does
24826	not have very much past medical history, but when he gets
24827	infected, he gets confused.
24828	He presents today with confusion.
24829	His visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness
24830	and fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as
24831	he has been when he has been ill in the past.
24832	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes
24833	type 2.
24834	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker.
24835	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise, negative.
24836	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative except as previously
24837	dictated.
24838	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole,
24839	Risperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.
24840	ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
24841	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian
24842	gentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time.
24843	He knows
24844	place and name.
24845	His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,
24846	blood pressure is 121/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room
24847	air, and his temperature is 101.5.
24848	He had left lower lobe
24849	crackles in his lung exam.
24850	The remainder of his physical exam
24851	was otherwise normal.
24852	Mucus membranes were moist.
24853	Abdomen was
24854	soft.
24855	Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

24860	creatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8.
24861	His chest x-ray showed no acute process.
24862	IMPRESSION:  My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis
24863	by virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his
24864	creatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the
24865	Emergency Department as a bolus.
24866	Given that pneumonia and
24867	urinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to
24868	treat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.
24869	He will be admitted to
24870	the Medical Service.

24979	We will start her on 
24980	Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d.

24984	or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication.

24986	she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
24987	eating.
24988	I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry.

24990	requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with

25111	Abdomen soft, nontender, no mass, organomegaly, no guarding, no rebound.
25112	Extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.
25113	Sensation is intact to microfilament testing bilaterally on her feet.
25114	Pedal pulses are present.
25115	Feet are warm.
25116	There is no rash, maceration, or lesion on her feet.
25117	LABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin A1c from October was 7.2.
25118	LDL from last May was 164.
25119	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
25120	1.
25121	Diabetes.
25122	Her diabetes has been near goal.
25123	We will recheck glucose, hemoglobin A1c, UA, and microalbuminuria and see how she is doing today.
25124	2.
25125	Elevated cholesterol.
25126	Her cholesterol was nowhere near our target of 100.
25127	She is on an increased Lipitor.
25128	We will check cholesterol, see how she is doing at this point, and an OT, PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication.
25129	3.
25130	Hypertension.
25131	All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension.
25132	I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication.
25133	She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does.
25134	She has to take her medication every day.
25135	I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now, go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that.
25136	I also asked her to return next week so we can recheck her blood pressure and make sure it is controlled.
25137	4.
25138	Health maintenance.
25139	I will schedule her for a mammogram.
25140	5.
25141	Colonic adenoma from 11/2076.
25142	She will need follow-up colonoscopy every three years per GI.

25220	HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.
25221	She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.
25222	This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.
25223	She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.
25224	The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.
25225	The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.
25226	She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.

25374	PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.
25375	ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
25376	KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions.
25377	Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
25378	PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place.
25379	There is a fibroid uterus.
25380	PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.
25381	There is trace free fluid.
25382	LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.

25386	There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.
25387	There has been a prior  a prior colostomy.
25388	There is diverticulosis.
25389	BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
25390	IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.
25391	Alternately, this could reflect ileus.
25392	Close clinical follow up advised.
25393	EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL
25394	ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
25395	Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  
25396	SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.
25397	Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.
25398	Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.
25399	Appreciate surgery input
25400	NGT to low wall suction
25401	NPO except meds for bowel rest
25402	Serial abdominal exams
25403	Check colostomy output guaiac
25404	Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.
25405	With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.
25406	Continue IVF while NPO
25407	Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
25408	Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.
25409	She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
25410	She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.
25411	Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.
25412	Transfuse 1U PRBCs
25413	Check colostomy guaiac
25414	Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
25415	Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.
25416	She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.
25417	She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.
25418	Hold Coumadin for now
25419	Follow up INR, goal 2-3
25420	HOCM/HTN: 
25421	Continue lopressor, verapamil
25422	Sarcoid:
25423	Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
25424	PAF
25425	Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio
25426	F/E/N:  NPO
25427	PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen

25438	Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23).
25439	She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli.
25440	She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX.
25441	Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection.
25442	Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility.
25443	Patient has no complaints.
25444	Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills.
25445	However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED.

25534	Abd CT (7/18/98): Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection.
25535	Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.
25536	Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.
25537	This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage.
25538	Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size.

25541	A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks.
25542	1.
25543	Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear.
25544	It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection.
25545	At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI.
25546	Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
25547	In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression.
25548	- F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures
25549	                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 
25550	                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)
25551	- Culture if spikes
25552	                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 
25553	                 improve
25554	2.
25555	Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past.
25556	During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy.
25557	GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy.
25558	It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive.
25559	- Type and screen
25560	                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement
25561	                - Check post-transfusion Hct 
25562	3.
25563	HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents
25564	                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB
25565	                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)
25566	4.
25567	Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR.
25568	Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding.
25569	As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her.
25570	- Monitor daily INRs
25571	                - Hold warfarin overnight
25572	5.
25573	Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2).

25590	EDVISIT^32612454^Barr, Nicky^01/13/93^IP, CARRIE
25591	I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Xue.
25592	I confirm
25593	that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the
25594	resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed
25595	the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
25596	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 57-year-old with back pain.
25597	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a young woman with a
25598	complicated past medical history, presents with a chronic history
25599	of low back pain, worse over the last week.
25600	She states that 3
25601	years ago, she had a motor vehicle accident.
25602	Since that time,
25603	has had chronic low back pain.
25604	She has been able to ambulate at
25605	home.
25606	Denies any fevers, rashes, history of urinary
25607	incontinence, weakness, or numbness.
25608	She went to EDUCARE-FARGO earlier
25609	this week and was prescribed Percocet, comes here now because the
25610	patient's family and the patient would like to change her care to
25611	Lansing Dover Clinic.
25612	Denies any numbness or weakness.
25613	States that she is no longer taking her pills at home.
25614	Denies
25615	any suicidal or homicidal ideation, has a flat affect.
25616	any depression.
25617	Her son, however, with whom she lives disagrees
25618	and is very concerned that she may be depressed.
25619	He is also very
25620	concerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is
25621	not caring for herself well at home.
25622	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and
25623	a prior stroke.
25624	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has also had knee surgery.
25625	SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per
25626	the written note.
25627	The patient was counseled regarding smoking
25628	cessation.
25629	MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.
25630	ALLERGIES:  None.
25631	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute
25632	distress.
25633	Vital signs are within normal limits as documented.
25634	For full physical exam findings, please see the resident's
25635	written note.
25636	Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,
25637	rectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as
25638	documented.
25639	Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in
25640	the groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to
25641	obesity.
25642	Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.
25643	Range
25644	of motion is full.
25645	Strength and tone is normal.
25646	The patient
25647	does have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing
25648	her back pain.
25649	Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but
25650	is oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic
25651	deficit in either motor or sensory distribution.
25652	She does,
25653	however, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.
25654	LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.
25655	BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,
25656	respectively.
25657	Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.
25658	Urinalysis is
25659	positive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and
25660	2+ bacteria.
25661	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient
25662	is her inability to care for self at home.
25663	It is apparent that
25664	her son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient
25665	on physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am
25666	concerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying
25667	neurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from
25668	thriving at home.
25669	Psychiatry initially was consulted.
25670	Their
25671	impression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem
25672	that needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a
25673	specific providers within the next 2 weeks.
25674	The patient was
25675	treated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.
25676	Care
25677	coordinator and social services were consulted.
25678	The patient will
25679	have a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary
25680	care services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and
25681	will likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication
25682	compliance and other ADLs.

26194	Patient Name:      Leon
26195	MRN:                      43634211
26196	Date:                      0021
26197	Consult reason:  
26198	?abnormal gait
26199	HPI:  53RHM who going to bed Wednesday was in usoh, but Thursday 2:30AM awoke w/ terrible HA, so came to ED; got CT head and LP, both negative for blood.
26200	However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s.
26201	I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged.
26202	Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight.
26203	He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone.
26204	However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait.
26205	An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI.
26206	Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx.
26207	Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints.
26208	He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone.
26209	VS in ED tonight: BP 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA
26210	Blood glucose not measured tonight.
26211	ROS: 
26212	Negative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait.
26213	General review of systems negative for:  fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).
26214	MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)
26215	ALL: nkda
26216	PMH: 
26217	-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night
26218	-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)

26264	A/P:  53RHM w/ HTN urgency yesterday, newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in 300-400s yesterday, who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative w/u for SAH, now back again for same HA, which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP (current BP 150s) and w/ medications.
26265	Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems.
26266	Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education.
26267	In any case, I find no acute neurological issues.
26268	Recs: 
26269	-BP management
26270	-DM management.
26271	Thanks for this interesting consult.

26275	Neurology resident PGY3
26276	Addendum: 
26277	He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 
26278	A note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.
26279	He is doing much better today.
26280	He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;

26354	The initial concerns were for a focal seizure 
26355	versus a TIA.
26356	The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, 
26357	therefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control 
26358	and the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's 
26359	care.
26360	The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group 
26361	weakness at this time, nor sensation changes.
26362	The patient will 
26363	require admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of 
26364	her seizure versus TIA.
26365	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.
26366	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
26367	admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

26385	Reason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees
26386	HPI:
26387	77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.
26388	At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.
26389	This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.
26390	In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.
26391	Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.
26392	Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.
26393	She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).
26394	Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.
26395	A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.
26396	In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.
26397	Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.
26398	She has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.
26399	Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.
26400	She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.
26401	ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).
26402	She denies fever/chills/sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough/rhinorrhea/sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria/polydipsia.

26484	Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.
26485	However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.
26486	Recs:
26487	- Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV, prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12-day outpatient taper (40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 3 days)
26488	- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks
26489	- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
26490	- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)
26491	Procedure: R knee aspiration
26492	Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent.
26493	The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach.
26494	1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella.
26495	A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn.
26496	A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.
26497	Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.
26498	Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

26834	Reason for Visit
26835	Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.
26836	We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.
26837	He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.
26838	He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.
26839	Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.
26840	He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.
26841	His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.
26842	I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.
26843	He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.
26844	He is worried about his remaining vision.
26845	He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.
26846	She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.
26847	He also is having trouble sleeping.
26848	He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.
26849	He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.
26850	He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

27056	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs
27057	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).
27058	Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.
27059	A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.
27060	Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

27167	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
27168	including subacute weight loss.
27169	IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
27170	75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.
27171	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
27172	severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.
27173	She
27174	has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation.
27175	Past right carotid endarterectomy.
27176	In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
27177	cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
27178	pneumonia.
27179	She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
27180	artery and left common carotid artery.
27181	She had subsequent
27182	episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
27183	with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.
27184	She is followed closely by
27185	Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
27186	interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.
27187	During her most recent hospitalization she had some
27188	confusion which was attributed to low sodium.
27189	This was
27190	felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
27191	SIADH.
27192	This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
27193	boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
27194	Lasix.
27195	No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
27196	Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
27197	Baseline weight 170 pounds.
27198	Weight in early September, 167
27199	pounds.
27200	Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.
27201	"Weight <PHI TYPE=""DATE"">November "
27202	28th</PHI>, 141 pounds.
27203	Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.
27204	She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
27205	revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.
27206	The
27207	G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
27208	never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
27209	Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
27210	with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
27211	swallow.
27212	Her caloric p.o.
27213	intake sounds as if it has been
27214	quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
27215	foods here and there.
27216	She is drinking two or three can of
27217	booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
27218	needs.
27219	Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
27220	(phone number 507.741.8042).
27221	Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
27222	potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
27223	1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.
27224	The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
27225	her weight has decreased.
27226	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
27227	blood per rectum within the last week.
27228	The patient's
27229	daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
27230	early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.
27231	patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
27232	visit.
27233	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
27234	1.
27235	Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above.
27236	2.
27237	Throat cancer in early 2060s.
27238	Status post XRT to the
27239	neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
27240	vertebral disease).
27241	3.
27242	Breast cancer.
27243	Details unknown.
27244	Will review at next

27260	Glaucoma.
27261	9.
27262	Anxiety.

27309	20.
27310	Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
27311	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
27312	SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.
27313	Her
27314	daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.
27315	Another daughter is staying with the
27316	patient full-time.
27317	Visiting nurse is involved.
27318	Previous to
27319	the last few months, the patient was fairly independent.
27320	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
27321	GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
27322	on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
27323	and carefully.
27324	Has a cane, but does not always use it.
27325	VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
27326	and 171/74 on repeat.
27327	Pulse 80.
27328	Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
27329	clothed.
27330	ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.
27331	Soft, nontender and
27332	nondistended.
27333	No hepatosplenomegaly.
27334	No masses.
27335	G-tube is
27336	flushed with water, and flushes easily.
27337	G-tube site itself
27338	is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.
27339	LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
27340	HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
27341	No murmurs.
27342	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
27343	Weight loss.
27344	Probably due to poor caloric intake.
27345	This
27346	is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
27347	progressively cachectic and weak.
27348	This is probably
27349	attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia.
27350	She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
27351	Tuesday.
27352	I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
27353	that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
27354	of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate.
27355	She should continue to take p.o.
27356	foods as tolerated, but she
27357	needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
27358	since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.
27359	Will try Glucerna
27360	because of her diabetes history.
27361	The patient's daughter and
27362	the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
27363	Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
27364	Nutrition Clinic in two days.
27365	Cerebrovascular disease.
27366	Followed closely by Neurology.
27367	No acute change in neuro status today.
27368	Will continue
27369	Coumadin.
27370	Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
27371	this.
27372	Recent INR 1.4.
27373	Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
27374	IM nurse.
27375	I need to review these records more closely, and
27376	try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.
27377	In
27378	the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently.
27379	Diabetes.
27380	Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
27381	to 350 range.
27382	Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
27383	range over the past few days.
27384	Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
27385	Finger-sticks three to four times daily.
27386	Further
27387	adjustments PRN.
27388	Our current goal is simply to maintain her
27389	sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.
27390	Once her
27391	dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
27392	tighter control.
27393	Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
27394	troubles with p.o.
27395	intake.
27396	Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.
27397	Daughter
27398	will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
27399	take it from there.
27400	Constipation.
27401	Continue Colace.
27402	Add Dulcolax PRN.
27403	Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.
27404	If she does
27405	have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
27406	her ability to eat successfully.
27407	Currently in reasonable control.
27408	Goal BP
27409	140 to 170, systolic.
27410	Initial severe hypertension this
27411	visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
27412	for her.
27413	Follow-up at next visit.
27414	Followed by Psychiatry.
27415	Extensive reassurance
27416	given today to the patient.
27417	She is very concerned about her
27418	weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
27419	take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion.
27420	Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd
27421	watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
27422	Multiple other issues.
27423	To be addressed at further
27424	visits.
27425	Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
27426	her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
27427	Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

27441	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
27442	reevaluate Coumadin.
27443	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
27444	77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
27445	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.
27446	Last
27447	week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
27448	It was a very very windy day.
27449	Afterwards she was outside and a
27450	huge gust of wind knocked her over.
27451	Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
27452	her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
27453	the wind blew.
27454	There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
27455	of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode.
27456	She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
27457	left eyebrow.
27458	She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
27459	CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
27460	lateral edge of her left eyebrow.
27461	She had films of her wrist and
27462	hips both of which were fine.
27463	She has bruising in these areas.
27464	Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
27465	back to normal.
27466	She had marked hypertension up to 250.
27467	She was treated with
27468	hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
27469	some hematuria.
27470	Her blood pressure at home since then has been
27471	180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.
27472	She
27473	is not on a beta-blocker currently.
27474	She has not had any episodes
27475	of chest pain.
27476	She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.
27477	MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o.
27478	b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
27479	q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
27480	lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
27481	p.r.n., levothyroxine
27482	100 mg p.o.
27483	q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.
27484	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas.
27485	She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.
27486	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
27487	weight 148 pounds.
27488	GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
27489	HEENT: PERRL.
27490	Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
27491	eyebrow is easily removed.
27492	No evidence of any infection.
27493	Her
27494	left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
27495	shoulder.
27496	Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
27497	bony step-offs.
27498	She walks well with no pain in her left hip.
27499	There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
27500	bursa.
27501	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
27502	bruising but no more serious complications.
27503	Fortunately she did
27504	not have intracranial bleeding.
27505	I am not sure why her blood
27506	pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
27507	falls verses independent causes.
27508	Given that the high blood
27509	pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o.
27510	q.d.,
27511	and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
27512	see how well this is working.
27513	Goal BP 140-160 systolic.
27514	urine was checked today.
27515	Hematuria has resolved.
27516	She has 2+
27517	proteinuria.
27518	I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
27519	her hypertension.
27520	We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
27521	and benefits of Coumadin therapy.
27522	Although she is at risk for
27523	falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
27524	Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke.
27525	She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
27526	that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke.
27527	I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
27528	hemorrhage and its consequences.
27529	I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
27530	month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
27531	working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
27532	increased risk for falls.
27533	It seems to me that she is in a gray
27534	area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
27535	for Coumadin for her.
27536	She feels very strongly that she wishes to
27537	continue.
27538	This was discussed in detail with her and her
27539	daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.
27540	I
27541	encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
27542	strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall.
27543	More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
27544	counseling and education.

27616	"  	  	  	  	  	"
27617	Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.
27618	She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.
27619	Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.
27620	Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.
27621	Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.
27622	This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.
27623	Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.
27624	Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.
27625	She is unable to tandem gait.
27626	Impression:
27627	Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
27628	She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.
27629	Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.
27630	My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.
27631	I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.
27632	I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.
27633	I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.
27634	I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.
27635	I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.
27636	Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.
27637	I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.
27638	This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.
27639	While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

27801	DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
27802	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
27803	The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
27804	In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.
27805	There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
27806	This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.
27807	The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
27808	She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.
27809	The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
27810	She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
27811	The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
27812	Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
27813	Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.
27814	There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
27815	On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.
27816	MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
27817	The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
27818	MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
27819	Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
27820	Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.
27821	It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
27822	Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
27823	Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
27824	There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
27825	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
27826	The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
27827	There are no medication allergies reported.
27828	PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.
27829	MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.
27830	Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.
27831	She uses alcohol occasionally.
27832	She has a 12th grade education.
27833	She lives alone and is a widow.
27834	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.
27835	The patient is overweight.
27836	Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
27837	Weight is 217 pounds.
27838	Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.
27839	Poor neck posture is noted.
27840	Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
27841	Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.
27842	Temporal arteries are normal.
27843	Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.
27844	Romberg is negative.
27845	Tandem gait is normal.
27846	The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.
27847	There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
27848	This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
27849	There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
27850	NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.
27851	Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.
27852	Extraocular movements are full.
27853	Visual fields are intact.
27854	There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.
27855	Hearing is intact.
27856	Oropharynx is normal.
27857	Palate elevates well.
27858	Tongue is midline.
27859	Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
27860	Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
27861	There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
27862	Coordination testing today seemed intact.
27863	Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
27864	Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.
27865	Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.
27866	IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.
27867	Comment.
27868	I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
27869	I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
27870	Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
27871	In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.
27872	It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
27873	PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.
27874	She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
27875	We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
27876	We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
27877	It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.
27878	For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.
27879	I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
27880	She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
27881	We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

29044	78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.
29045	Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.
29046	Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.
29047	ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis

29871	&#183;         This is only an initial set of guidelines.
29872	The doses will have to be adjusted based on experience, diet, exercise, and illness.
29873	&#183;         Goal is to have blood sugars before meals in the 90-130 range and blood sugars at bedtime in the 110-140 range.
29874	&#183;         Check blood sugars initially before meals and at bedtime each day.
29875	Record the times, blood sugars, insulin doses and all food on the sheets provided and bring these sheets to your medical appointments.
29876	&#183;         Call Dr. Xenakis&#8217;s office for any blood sugars under 70, or any symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).
29877	&#183;         Also call if blood sugars are often over 180.

29977	RE:  Xavier Olive
29978	Dear Michael,
29979	Mr. Xavier Olive presents for evaluation, thanks for your
29980	referral.
29981	As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is
29982	status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
29983	lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
29984	popliteal artery on the left.
29985	The patient presents now for
29986	"further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms""."
29987	The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
29988	there are about equivalent in nature.
29989	He has very minimal low
29990	back pain.
29991	He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
29992	be associated with some abnormal gait.
29993	He states on a bad day
29994	its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
29995	high as 8-9/10.
29996	The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
29997	by things like walking.
29998	He can walk less than one block at which
29999	point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
30000	shuffling and occasionally falling.
30001	When he is having severe
30002	symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.
30003	He denies any bowel or
30004	bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
30005	UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
30006	He has very
30007	little back pain associated with his symptomatology.
30008	He has had
30009	no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.
30010	He
30011	describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
30012	states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
30013	Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.
30014	His weight is
30015	steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.
30016	doesn't smoke and drinks socially.
30017	Quit smoking 33 years ago.
30018	He does not think he will ever be pain free.
30019	Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
30020	and he has been for the past couple of years.
30021	He has difficulty
30022	with sleep.
30023	He has a balance problem and also has benign
30024	prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
30025	for this he takes Cardura.
30026	He has a history of high blood
30027	pressure.
30028	Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.
30029	No
30030	respiratory malfunction.
30031	"He has had surgery for something ""in"
30032	"his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery."
30033	He is on Plavix and
30034	aspirin.
30035	Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
30036	appearing male.
30037	He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
30038	side his T band seems to be slightly weak.
30039	Single toe raises
30040	show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.
30041	He has no
30042	tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.
30043	He has
30044	negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.
30045	Forward flexion allows him
30046	to get to the patella.
30047	Extension is pain free and passive
30048	hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.
30049	Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.
30050	Sensory is
30051	symmetric.
30052	He has negative straight leg raises.
30053	palpable pulses.
30054	He is hairless in his lower extremities.
30055	had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
30056	"that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality""."
30057	He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
30058	and for his gastroesophageal reflux.
30059	Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
30060	with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
30061	his iliac artery on the right.
30062	CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
30063	hypertrophy.
30064	At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
30065	disk disease.
30066	I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
30067	see me after that.
30068	Thanks for the referral.

30166	"			Reason for visit:"
30167	   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.
30168	Interval History:
30169	   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
30170	His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.
30171	Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.
30172	He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.
30173	Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.
30174	He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.
30175	The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.
30176	The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.
30177	Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.
30178	The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.
30179	His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.
30180	It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.
30181	At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.
30182	Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.
30183	The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.
30184	Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.
30185	Past medical history:
30186	   Diabetes, onset in 2135.
30187	Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.
30188	The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.
30189	MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.
30190	Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.
30191	Neuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI.
30192	Cervical spondylosis.
30193	Tracheal tumor resection in 2128 performed via a suprasternal incision.
30194	Hypertension.
30195	Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2153 during one of his peripheral angiograms.
30196	Current Medications:
30197	  lisinopril 2.5 mg QD
30198	 glyburide 2.5 mg QD
30199	 cilostazol 100 mg BID

30216	Social history:
30217	   He is retried Motor Vehicle Body Repairer.
30218	He used to work at GM.
30219	He lives with his wife, who comes in today with him.
30220	He has three children.
30221	Nondrinker.
30222	He smoked until 30 years ago.
30223	Review of systems:
30224	   Detailed review of systems was carried out.
30225	It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.
30226	He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.
30227	He has nocturia.
30228	He wears dentures.
30229	No significant weight loss or anorexia.
30230	No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.
30231	He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.
30232	Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.
30233	Physical examination:
30234	-Pulse:   68 and regular.
30235	Afebrile
30236	-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.
30237	Equal bilaterally
30238	-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.
30239	Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance
30240	-Skin:   Without rashes
30241	-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils
30242	-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.
30243	No JVD
30244	-Chest:   Clear
30245	-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs
30246	-Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender.
30247	Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta.
30248	May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation
30249	-Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides.
30250	Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.
30251	Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.
30252	Good capillary refill
30253	-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.
30254	His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.
30255	He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.
30256	Otherwise, no focal deficits
30257	Procedures:
30258	Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.
30259	92 and 1.03, respectively.
30260	The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.
30261	I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.
30262	EKG:
30263	    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.
30264	There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.
30265	Other Data:
30266	   DOB: 11/25/2083.
30267	Assessment and plan:
30268	   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.
30269	Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.
30270	Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.
30271	On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.
30272	His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.
30273	I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.
30274	1.
30275	As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.
30276	Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.
30277	2.
30278	Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.
30279	PLAN: 
30280	Formal exercise ABIs.
30281	Obtain angiographic studies from AC.

30375	Assessment:  
30376	  1.
30377	Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
30378	It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
30379	pressure.
30380	I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH.
30381	In addition Dr
30382	Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his
30383	blood pressure with out changing his motor ability.

30599	In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.
30600	After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.
30601	Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.
30602	Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.
30603	He received 21 days of flagyl.
30604	After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.
30605	Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.

30769	Quick
30770	"ATCH: 		655-75-45"
30771	Dear Harry and Yair:
30772	My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
30773	As you know, she is just 52 years of age.
30774	Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.
30775	She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
30776	She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
30777	She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
30778	On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.
30779	This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.
30780	In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
30781	There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
30782	She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
30783	By last spring, i.e.
30784	a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
30785	She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
30786	Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
30787	Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.
30788	Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???
30789	length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
30790	Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
30791	She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
30792	She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
30793	On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.
30794	Pulse was 70 and regular.
30795	Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
30796	She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.
30797	There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
30798	She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
30799	This is of course a very unhappy situation.
30800	Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
30801	However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
30802	I would suggest the following.
30803	Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.
30804	Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
30805	She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
30806	If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
30807	I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
30808	My thanks once again.
30809	With every best wish.
30810	Sincerely,
30811	Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

30995	cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg
30996	HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.
30997	Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.
30998	Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.
30999	She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.
31000	She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.
31001	She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.
31002	Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.
31003	She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.
31004	She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).
31005	She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).
31006	She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

31173	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.
31174	The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.
31175	There was no obvious leg buckling.
31176	She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.
31177	Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.
31178	MEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d.
31179	without significant effect on her low back pain.
31180	Ultram q.i.d.
31181	was beneficial.
31182	Neurontin 300 q.i.d.
31183	which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.
31184	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.
31185	She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.
31186	She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.
31187	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.
31188	She has had left knee arthroscopy.
31189	She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.
31190	She has had a ten year history of diabetes.
31191	She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.
31192	MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.
31193	ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
31194	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.
31195	No history of tobacco or alcohol.
31196	FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.

31198	Her mental state examination is normal.
31199	Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
31200	Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.
31201	Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.
31202	DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.
31203	Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.
31204	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.
31205	We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.
31206	For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.
31207	We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.
31208	The patient will return to clinic after these studies.

31218	MR#  0942207
31219	Date of Admission:  8/26/66
31220	Attending: Yoel Pollard
31221	PCP:  Susan Ullom
31222	CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status
31223	HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)
31224	Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.
31225	She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66.
31226	Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.
31227	She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.
31228	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed.
31229	However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.
31230	8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear.
31231	U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin.
31232	There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.
31233	Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.
31234	Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days.
31235	She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.
31236	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus.
31237	She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.
31238	PMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)
31239	1.

31345	No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.
31346	No change in ventricle size.
31347	No acute infarct; although, this is
31348	"	better assessed with MR with diffusion."
31349	Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale
31350	"	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due"
31351	"	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup."
31352	"EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals."
31353	Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam.
31354	No evidence of acute ischemia.
31355	Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.
31356	Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source.
31357	Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66.
31358	Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.
31359	-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures
31360	-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism
31361	UTI
31362	-likely UTI- tx
31363	-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source
31364	-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic
31365	-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data
31366	-change foley now
31367	-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics
31368	Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status
31369	-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
31370	If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection
31371	-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm.
31372	If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic.
31373	If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.
31374	DM
31375	-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements
31376	Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH
31377	GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary
31378	HTN-continue home medications

31500	Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine
31501	693-31-18-1
31502	I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.
31503	The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.
31504	He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.
31505	In August he suffered a stroke.
31506	He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.
31507	He recalls no problem with his vision.
31508	He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.
31509	He does no know the extent of the evaluation.
31510	He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.
31511	He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.
31512	His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.
31513	He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.
31514	He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.
31515	The dizziness is worst in the morning.
31516	He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.
31517	He has DM and HTN.
31518	He is a nonsmoker.
31519	I don't have cholesterol information.
31520	There is no history of cardiac disease.
31521	There is no history of alcohol abuse.
31522	He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.
31523	He has no known allergies.
31524	He is aware of no significant family history.
31525	He is married.
31526	He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.
31527	He came to america from Honduras in 2073.
31528	He worked nights in construction until his stroke.
31529	Pulse 66, regular.
31530	BP 186/110.
31531	There are no cranial bruits.
31532	The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.
31533	The lungs are clear.
31534	The heart is regular with no murmur.
31535	The abdomen is benign.
31536	The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.
31537	He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.
31538	His fluency in his native language is probably normal.
31539	Cranial nerves are intact.
31540	There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.
31541	(He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)
31542	Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.
31543	The tone is only mildly increased.
31544	Sensation is intact.
31545	Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).
31546	The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.
31547	Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.
31548	He wears a right AFO.
31549	He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.
31550	His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.
31551	This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.
31552	He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.
31553	Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.
31554	To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.
31555	I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.
31556	He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.
31557	He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.
31558	I asked him to return here in a month to review this.
31559	Sincerely,
31560	Patrick Winn, M.D.

31924	CXR: clear
31925	CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts
31926	"CTA: pending	"
31927	"MRI/MRA:	pending"
31928	Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms.
31929	Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait.
31930	Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits.
31931	However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.
31932	Plan:   
31933	-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis
31934	Check MRI brain stroke protocol
31935	Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180
31936	Control hyperglycemia
31937	If stroke present, admit to Neurology.
31938	R/O MI
31939	Discussed with Dr. Costello.

31948	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.
31949	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
31950	woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
31951	hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
31952	06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.
31953	She
31954	presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
31955	normal.
31956	Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.
31957	She was admitted to
31958	the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.
31959	Her imaging studies
31960	showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
31961	of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
31962	in addition to a left ICA occlusion.
31963	She was taken to angiogram
31964	for interventional neuroradiology.
31965	She had an angiogram.
31966	Radiology felt they were unable to access the
31967	cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
31968	admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
31969	hypertensive therapy.
31970	She remained stable anti-coagulated on
31971	heparin.
31972	During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
31973	to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
31974	be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
31975	remain anti-coagulated.
31976	She was discharged to rehab and
31977	subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.
31978	At home, she
31979	had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
31980	feeling O.K.
31981	VNA sees her once a week.
31982	At rehab, for unclear
31983	reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
31984	discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
31985	done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
31986	unaware of any such problems.
31987	She continues to get PT and
31988	occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
31989	remains poor.
31990	According to the family member and her daughter
31991	who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
31992	to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
31993	decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
31994	to communicate well with her.
31995	Since her discharge, she has not
31996	had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
31997	changes.
31998	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
31999	chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
32000	claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
32001	heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
32002	diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
32003	rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
32004	or bleeding problems.
32005	Review of neurological systems as above.

32013	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
32014	rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.
32015	General:  Pleasant woman in
32016	no acute distress.
32017	HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
32018	anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.
32019	There is no thyromegaly.
32020	Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.
32021	Heart:  Regular rate
32022	and rhythm.
32023	Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
32024	Abdomen:  Has good
32025	bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
32026	Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
32027	Skin:  No rashes
32028	or ulcers.
32029	Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
32030	interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.
32031	She is attentive.
32032	is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.
32033	She has
32034	decreased naming and decreased comprehension.
32035	She does not have
32036	any neglect or apraxia.
32037	Registration is 3/4.
32038	Short-term memory
32039	is 0/4 in 5 minutes.
32040	Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
32041	Fundi are normal.
32042	Extraocular movements are intact with
32043	nystagmus.
32044	Visual fields are full to confrontation.
32045	She has a
32046	right facial droop.
32047	Facial sensation is intact.
32048	Hearing is
32049	Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
32050	arm and leg.
32051	She has strength on the left is normal.
32052	On the
32053	right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
32054	left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.
32055	reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm.
32056	There is no ataxia on the left.
32057	Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
32058	and so conducts the right leg.
32059	Her reflexes are brisker on the
32060	right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.
32061	IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
32062	acute stroke or hemorrhage.
32063	On the CT, there was a question of a
32064	left MI cutoff.
32065	CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
32066	stenosis with minimal distal interflow.
32067	MRI of the brain showed
32068	a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
32069	the caudate basal ganglia.
32070	She has had mild to moderate chronic
32071	small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.
32072	Echo showed a normal
32073	EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.
32074	IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
32075	vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
32076	with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
32077	infarct.
32078	On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
32079	comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.
32080	It
32081	is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
32082	stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
32083	during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
32084	anti-coagulation therapy.
32085	I have asked her to get a follow up
32086	PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
32087	any contraindications to anti-coagulation.
32088	If there are no such
32089	contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.
32090	In addition,
32091	her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
32092	her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d.
32093	and to maintain a
32094	blood pressure diary.
32095	RECOMMENDATIONS:
32096	1.
32097	Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
32098	t.i.d.
32099	2.
32100	Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
32101	3.
32102	Continue risk factor modification with the management of
32103	blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
32104	4.
32105	PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
32106	stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
32107	per the PCP.
32108	5.
32109	Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
32110	training and language rehab.
32111	6.
32112	Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
32113	problems.
32114	More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
32115	and counseling.

32208	72 year-old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow-up.
32209	She has had a significant recovery.
32210	Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.
32211	Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them.
32212	She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well.
32213	She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this.
32214	RTC as needed.
32215	Call with questions.
32216	More than 50% of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling.

32303	I saw this patient with Dr. Rosalia West.
32304	I confirm that I have
32305	interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's
32306	documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the
32307	evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
32308	Please see the resident's note for further details.
32309	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.
32310	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female
32311	with history of prior strokes, hypertension, diabetes, and
32312	paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental
32313	status.
32314	As per report, the patient has not been acting like
32315	herself and not communicating or speaking like herself.
32316	The
32317	patient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago
32318	where she started to develop a cough as well as some chills.
32319	patient's family members state that the patient has not been out
32320	of bed and has been unwilling to eat.
32321	The patient's family
32322	members state that the patient is not acting like her usual self.
32323	The patient's family members deny noting the patient complaining
32324	of any nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.
32325	patient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the
32326	patient was starting to speak less.
32327	The patient was seen clinic
32328	and was thought to be depressed.
32329	The patient has a known history
32330	of a facial droop.
32331	The patient was incontinent of urine today.
32332	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs reveal the
32333	following:  Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per
32334	minute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144/110, and
32335	oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
32336	The patient's oxygen
32337	saturation was interpreted as borderline low.
32338	General:  No acute
32339	distress, multiple family members at bedside.
32340	HEENT:  The
32341	patient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp
32342	hematomas.
32343	Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
32344	Mucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no
32345	drooling.
32346	Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits appreciated.
32347	There was no meningismus.
32348	Respiratory:  Poor cooperation with
32349	exam.
32350	Fair aeration, no focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes, no
32351	increased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was
32352	noted.
32353	Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, tachycardic,
32354	unable to appreciate any gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
32355	GI: 
32356	Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, prior well-healed prior
32357	G-tube scar noted.
32358	Rectal exam deferred.
32359	GU exam:  The patient
32360	was incontinent of urine.
32361	Skin:  Warm and dry.
32362	No rash or
32363	lesions were noted.
32364	Back:  The patient did not have any
32365	costovertebral angle tenderness.
32366	There is no midline thoracic,
32367	lumbar, or sacral spine tenderness to palpation.
32368	Extremities: 
32369	Warm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or asymmetrical
32370	lower extremity edema was noted.
32371	There were no palpable cords.
32372	Neuro:  The patient was alert, the patient was a verbal.
32373	patient grossly moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.
32374	patient responded to touch appropriately.
32375	The patient was unable
32376	to cooperate with cranial nerve examination.
32377	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 76-year-old female
32378	with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
32379	status and urinary incontinence.
32380	Differential diagnosis at this
32381	time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.
32382	patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and
32383	as per review of prior notes.
32384	Repeat stroke is certainly on the
32385	differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a
32386	metabolic or infectious etiology.
32387	The patient will need to have
32388	a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley
32389	catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT
32390	scan.
32391	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency
32392	Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed.
32393	The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
32394	ventricular response.
32395	The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate
32396	of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid
32397	ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the
32398	lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.
32399	No definite
32400	ST segment abnormalities were noted.
32401	The patient then had a
32402	portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable
32403	chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or
32404	findings.
32405	The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and
32406	the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some
32407	right-sided edema.
32408	The patient will have this followed up with
32409	an MRI of the brain.
32410	The patient's laboratory studies were
32411	notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.
32412	The patient's
32413	lactic acid was 1.7.
32414	The patient's white blood cell count was
32415	not elevated.
32416	The patient was not anemic.
32417	urinalysis was consistent with infection.
32418	The patient's first
32419	set of cardiac markers were negative.
32420	The patient's coagulation
32421	studies were normal.
32422	The patient was treated with ceftriaxone
32423	for her urinary tract infection.
32424	The patient could possibly have
32425	urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.
32426	Urine sepsis is my
32427	leading diagnosis at this time.
32428	The patient's right-sided edema
32429	is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient
32430	will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.
32431	The patient
32432	will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.
32433	will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.
32434	The patient's blood
32435	pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient
32436	needs an intensive care unit bed.
32437	In terms the patient's atrial
32438	fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was
32439	given metoprolol IV.
32440	The patient was not given any oral
32441	medications secondary to her possible stroke.
32442	The patient was
32443	given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her
32444	elevated potassium at 5.2.
32445	PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
32446	1.
32447	Urosepsis.
32448	2.
32449	Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
32450	3.
32451	Hyponatremia.
32452	4.
32453	Hyperkalemia.
32454	DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a
32455	monitor bed.
32456	CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.

32585	PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE.GCC Team A Infectious Disease Consultation
32586	Patient: Mack, Rose C (06129040, 63I)
32587	ID Fellow: Amanda Qualls
32588	ID Attending: Craig Faulkner
32589	Referring Physician: Dr. Kevin Katz
32590	Date of Consult: 10/26/2092
32591	Reason for Consult: DM, chronic R and L. foot ulcerations; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, pain
32592	HPI: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer.
32593	She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM.
32594	She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals.
32595	She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics.
32596	She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa.
32597	In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting.
32598	In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA.
32599	She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening).
32600	She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge.
32601	Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting.
32602	In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely.
32603	During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations.
32604	She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically.
32605	These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92.
32606	She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds.
32607	On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively.
32608	She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft.
32609	She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously.
32610	Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past.
32611	Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot.
32612	She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement.
32613	She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias.
32614	She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.
32615	PMH:
32616	poorly controlled type I DM since age 12&#8212;complicated by diabetic retinopathy s/p bilateral vitrectomies for retinal hemorrhage, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic nephropathy (gastroparesis)&#8212;on an insulin pump

32618	2083: R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, poor union, subsequent fracture of the remainder of her R. metarsals
32619	chronic ulcerated callus over R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis, no improvement despite multiple courses of antibiotics
32620	12/89: I+D of R. foot ulceration&#8212;cultures grew P. aeruginosa
32621	3/90: debridement of chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting
32622	6/90: deep debridement of her 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;cultures grew MSSA
32623	2/92: calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening for equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot
32624	4/92: subsequent development of R. heel ulceration, s/p debridement of her ulceration, removal of a screw, vacuum sponge placement
32625	4/92: R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting
32626	7/92: debridement of her R. heel wound and full thickness skin graft (12 x 5cm)
32627	9/92: development of L. heel and forefoot ulcerations at rehabilitation, with debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer on 9/10&#8212;found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her eschar

32790	Assessment 
32791	T1DM - Uncontrolled.
32792	Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital.
32793	Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use.
32794	Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today.
32795	While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed.
32796	Recommendations
32797	1.
32798	Continue with insulin pump.
32799	Instructed pt that she must:
32800	       a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the 
32801	       flow sheet.
32802	b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter.
32803	c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump.
32804	RN should page HO and/or diabetes dept 
32805	       immediately for orders for SC insulin.
32806	d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff.
32807	Pt agrees to all of the above.
32808	2.
32809	Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime.
32810	Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request.
32811	Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet.
32812	3.
32813	For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140.
32814	If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes.
32815	Treat BG less than 80 with 1/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above.
32816	Do not remove insulin pump.
32817	Page 5-8112 with any concerns during the procedure.
32818	Diabetes dept will continue to monitor.
32819	Please page 5-8112 with any questions or concerns.
32820	Thank you.

33010	Lung Transplant Attending Note:
33011	I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.
33012	Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.
33013	The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.
33014	The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.
33015	Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.
33016	Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.
33017	Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.
33018	DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.
33019	Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.
33020	We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.
33021	Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.
33022	Continue maintenance medications for CF.

33391	North Andover, KY  41454
33392	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.
33393	The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.
33394	In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.
33395	The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.
33396	There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.
33397	The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.
33398	Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.
33399	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.
33400	She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.
33401	MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
33402	She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.
33403	SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.
33404	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.
33405	Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.
33406	The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
33407	Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.
33408	There is no murmur.
33409	The abdomen is soft and nontender.
33410	The liver is not palpably enlarged.
33411	The extremities are warm without edema.
33412	Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.
33413	There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
33414	There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.
33415	Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.
33416	Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.
33417	In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.
33418	Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.
33419	We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.
33420	There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.
33421	Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.
33422	Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.
33423	Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

33619	Patient Name: Moss, Derek
33620	MR: 89659991
33621	Reason for consult: assistance with management of possible persistent L shoulder septic arthritis in patient pre-op for planned hip replacement 
33622	Source: patient, MR
33623	Counsult requested by: Dr. Everett Pace
33624	Date of consult: 1/20
33625	Location: 4E-66
33626	__________________________________________________________________
33627	HPI: Mr. Moss is a 77 yo M with PmHx significant for DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, s/p multiple knee surgeries who, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.
33628	Mr. Moss has experienced multiple falls recently, and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last September.
33629	Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.
33630	After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.
33631	He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.
33632	After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.
33633	MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.
33634	Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.
33635	L shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN).
33636	Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.
33637	He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.
33638	He was started on cefazolin.
33639	Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).
33640	Blood cultures were negative.
33641	He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.
33642	Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.
33643	A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.
33644	He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.
33645	Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.
33646	Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head.
33647	Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.
33648	Mr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.
33649	He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.
33650	No drainage.
33651	Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.
33652	Blood glucoses had been well controlled.
33653	His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.

33735	Micro Data: 
33736	None recently
33737	Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)
33738	Imaging:
33739	Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.
33740	The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear.
33741	The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease.
33742	There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.
33743	AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.
33744	Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.
33745	With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.
33746	Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.
33747	The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.
33748	He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).
33749	Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.
33750	However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.
33751	As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.
33752	The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.
33753	However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.
33754	This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.
33755	Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).
33756	Recommendations:
33757	-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data
33758	-Aspirate shoulder.
33759	Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures
33760	-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement
33761	-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection
33762	-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement
33763	-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo
33764	Thank you for this interesting consultation.
33765	We will continue to follow with you.

34230	BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD

34242	Recommended to repeat it soon.
34243	Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2.

34652	He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.
34653	He has improved with heart rate control.
34654	Exam
34655	VS - as noted
34656	General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.
34657	Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.
34658	CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
34659	Lungs - clear
34660	Abdomen - obese
34661	Extremities - minimal edema
34662	Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.
34663	Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.
34664	Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.
34665	Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.
34666	"I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission."
34667	Recommendations:  
34668	Increase metoprolol dose.
34669	May need Toprol XL 100 BID.
34670	Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.
34671	Filter all IVs (PFO)
34672	PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
34673	Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

34863	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xian is 75 years of age.
34864	She has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required
34865	treatment with insulin.
34866	She has been managed with oral
34867	hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections.
34868	She also has a history of CVA.
34869	I last saw her in August of last year.
34870	She was seen by Ms.
34871	Vann, our nurse practitioner in early May.
34872	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and
34873	two in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o.
34874	q.d., and Avandia
34875	2 mg one p.o.
34876	q.a.m.
34877	According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr
34878	29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg
34879	one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was
34880	prescribed back in 2072.
34881	The patient and her son today are
34882	not sure that she is taking this medication.
34883	In fact, they
34884	believe that she is not.
34885	There has been moderate polyuria
34886	and polydipsia.
34887	Control of diabetes has been erratic.
34888	Hemoglobin A1c has been elevated.
34889	On Apr 29, 2073, blood
34890	glucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes
34891	within normal limits as was calcium.
34892	Cholesterol was 315.
34893	Hemoglobin A1c 10.6.
34894	The patient has not experienced chest
34895	pain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath
34896	when climbing stairs.
34897	There has been no orthopnea and no
34898	PND.
34899	She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced
34900	near syncope.
34901	She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
34902	constipation.
34903	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination today, she
34904	appears well.
34905	Blood pressure 122/66.
34906	The heart rate is 90
34907	and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds
34908	less than last year.
34909	Random blood glucose was 224.
34910	The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071.
34911	She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms
34912	suggestive of TIA.
34913	The patient has a past history of
34914	hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.
34915	She has
34916	not been hypothyroid since then.
34917	In fact, the last TSH
34918	level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her
34919	departure to Ghana.
34920	She denies heat intolerance as well
34921	as palpitations.
34922	On physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute
34923	distress.
34924	The neck veins are flat.
34925	The extraocular
34926	movements are full.
34927	There are no symptoms of
34928	hyperthyroidism.
34929	The chest is clear to auscultation.
34930	The
34931	heart sounds are regular.
34932	There are no rubs or gallops.
34933	The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are
34934	free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require
34935	attention.
34936	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
34937	history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131
34938	with good results who, last year before she left the
34939	country, had a subnormal TSH.
34940	She does not have obvious
34941	symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
34942	repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.
34943	Diabetes continues to be a problem.
34944	Glycemic control
34945	continues to be difficult to achieve.
34946	Today, I have
34947	reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o.
34948	q.d.
34949	The son is going
34950	to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
34951	is not taking this medicine at this point.
34952	The other
34953	medications were continued.
34954	It is indeed possible that she
34955	will need insulin in the near future.
34956	I plan close followup
34957	and will see her again in six weeks' time.
34958	If she is
34959	hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in
34960	achieving glycemic control.
34961	Against this is the high
34962	cholesterol.
34963	She used to be on Lipitor, which was
34964	discontinued during her trip to Ghana.
34965	I have
34966	reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o.
34967	I have also
34968	added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o.
34969	to protect
34970	her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

35321	Chief Complaint: shortness of breath
35322	History of Present Illness: Mr. Pearson is a an 87 year old gentleman with COPD on home oxygen, CVA, DM, and history of lung cancer s/p resection without chemotherapy who presented to the ED with acute shortness of breath.
35323	Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago.
35324	He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping.
35325	But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion.
35326	Not made worse with lying down.
35327	He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes.
35328	EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.
35329	He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.
35330	An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.
35331	His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.
35332	He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.
35333	He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.
35334	He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.
35335	He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.

35406	     Right upper lobe and right middle lobe opacity, new since
35407	     5/27/2132, suspicious for pneumonia.
35408	Lines and tubes as described above, without evidence of
35409	     pneumothorax following left IJ placement.
35410	EKG: sinus tachycardia at 134bpm; right ventricular hypertrophy; 0.5mm ST depression V6
35411	Assessment and Plan
35412	Mr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.
35413	He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
35414	He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.
35415	His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
35416	Sepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12
35417	a. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12
35418	b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)
35419	c. monitor urine output
35420	d. measure central venous oxygen saturation
35421	e. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am
35422	f.  f/u all culture data
35423	g. continue advair 250/50
35424	h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED
35425	i.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension
35426	ARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration
35427	Ppx: ranitidine and heparin
