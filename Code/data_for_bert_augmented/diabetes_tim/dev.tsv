6	0	a	Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis
7	0	a	HPI:
8	0	a	27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.
9	3	a	This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.
10	0	a	At the time, blood sugar was >500.
11	0	a	Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.
12	0	a	The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.
13	0	a	At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.
14	0	a	LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
15	0	a	He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.
16	0	a	Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
17	0	a	He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
18	0	a	Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.
19	0	a	The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
20	0	a	HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
21	0	a	He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
22	0	a	Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.
23	0	a	Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
24	0	a	Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
25	0	a	Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.
26	0	a	He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
27	0	a	But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
28	0	a	A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
29	0	a	As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.
30	0	a	Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.
31	0	a	As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.
32	0	a	As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.
33	0	a	For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
34	0	a	He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.
35	0	a	His energy has been good.
36	0	a	He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.
37	0	a	No bleeding/bruising.
38	0	a	No further swelling in his arms/legs.
39	0	a	He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.

85	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
86	0	a	Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.
87	0	a	He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
88	0	a	Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.
89	0	a	It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
90	0	a	At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.
91	0	a	If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.
92	0	a	At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.
93	0	a	If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.
94	0	a	Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.
95	0	a	In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

109	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
110	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
111	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
112	3	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
113	0	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
114	0	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
115	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
116	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
117	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
118	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
119	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
120	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
121	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

169	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
170	3	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
171	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
172	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
173	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
174	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
175	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
176	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
177	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
178	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
179	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
180	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
181	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
182	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
183	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
184	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
185	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
186	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
187	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

465	0	a	A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.
466	0	a	His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.
467	0	a	He is being managed by ID.
468	0	a	His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.
469	0	a	His abdominal CT is pending.
470	0	a	He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.
471	0	a	As such, we recommend:
472	0	a	--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
473	0	a	--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
474	0	a	Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
475	0	a	Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.
476	0	a	D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.
477	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

807	0	a	Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
808	3	a	diagnosed type II diabetes.
809	0	a	He has been very compliant with his 
810	0	a	medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
811	0	a	and NPH 
812	0	a	insulin subQ q.AM.

814	0	a	check his blood sugar at the time.
815	0	a	He has not had any frank 
816	0	a	palpitations or lightheadedness.
817	0	a	He did have 1 episode where he had the 
818	0	a	sensation of several extra heart beats.

820	0	a	other symptoms including no chest pain.
821	0	a	He has never had a fingerstick 
822	0	a	blood glucose below the mid 150's.
823	0	a	I am looking through his log and see 
824	0	a	that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
825	0	a	dinner they have been between 157-296.
826	0	a	He has already met several times 
827	2	a	with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
828	0	a	therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
829	0	a	diabetic diet.
830	0	a	On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
831	0	a	pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
832	0	a	IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars.
833	0	a	I will increase his 
834	0	a	insulin regimen.
835	0	a	He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
836	0	a	new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
837	0	a	before bedtime.
838	0	a	And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d.
839	0	a	and 
840	0	a	I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
841	0	a	syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.
842	0	a	He is to follow up with me in 
843	0	a	several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.
844	0	a	I have 
845	0	a	advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
846	0	a	his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
847	0	a	symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
848	0	a	at that time as well.

1042	0	a	PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.
1043	0	a	We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.
1044	0	a	Will check ESR today.
1045	0	a	Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.
1046	0	a	Depression:  She seems better.
1047	0	a	Continue Effexor.
1048	0	a	Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.
1049	0	a	Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.
1050	0	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.
1051	0	a	Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.
1052	0	a	Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.
1053	0	a	Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
1054	0	a	Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
1055	0	a	Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
1056	0	a	Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
1057	3	a	DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
1058	0	a	Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
1059	0	a	Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
1060	0	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
1061	0	a	Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.
1062	0	a	11.
1063	0	a	Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

1084	0	a	approximately 26 weeks.
1085	0	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
1086	0	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
1087	3	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
1088	0	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
1089	0	a	Subsequently he 
1090	0	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
1091	0	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
1092	0	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.

1108	0	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July

1110	0	a	infarctions.
1111	0	a	In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
1112	0	a	transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.

1114	0	a	that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
1115	0	a	with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
1116	0	a	degree of symptoms.
1117	0	a	The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
1118	0	a	day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.

1206	0	a	revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
1207	0	a	normal differential.
1208	0	a	Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
1209	0	a	multiple medical problems.
1210	0	a	The one's most pertinent to us currently are 
1211	0	a	007 Lunar Lane                           61248040
1212	0	a	Page 3
1213	0	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
1214	0	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
1215	0	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
1216	0	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
1217	0	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
1218	0	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
1219	0	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
1220	0	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
1221	0	a	patients.
1222	0	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
1223	0	a	this makes sense.
1224	0	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
1225	0	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
1226	0	a	reasons.
1227	0	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
1228	0	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
1229	0	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
1230	0	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
1231	0	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
1232	0	a	We would be a little 
1233	0	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
1234	0	a	without more information about this patient.
1235	3	a	The patient's diabetes 
1236	0	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
1237	0	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
1238	0	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
1239	0	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
1240	0	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
1241	0	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
1242	0	a	situation.
1243	0	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

1247	0	a	be seen.

1664	0	a	RE:  Peter Joshi
1665	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4
1666	0	a	Dear Dr.
1667	0	a	Craft:
1668	0	a	I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.
1669	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint
1670	0	a	of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
1671	0	a	The patient does relate that
1672	0	a	he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly
1673	0	a	worse several years ago.
1674	0	a	However, with the treatment of his
1675	0	a	coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until
1676	0	a	he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
1677	0	a	Since that
1678	0	a	surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time
1679	0	a	during which he has required supplemental oxygen.
1680	0	a	At the same
1681	0	a	time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure
1682	0	a	and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing
1683	0	a	Lasix.
1684	0	a	The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he
1685	0	a	did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician
1686	0	a	did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.
1687	0	a	At the current time,
1688	0	a	Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
1689	0	a	able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several
1690	0	a	months ago.
1691	0	a	In fact, he was told recently that he does not need
1692	0	a	supplemental oxygen.
1693	0	a	He denies a chronic cough, although he does
1694	0	a	occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to
1695	0	a	coughing.
1696	3	a	His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery
1697	0	a	stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent
1698	0	a	placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,
1699	0	a	hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and
1700	0	a	upper GI bleed.
1701	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70
1702	0	a	His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,
1703	0	a	Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,
1704	0	a	potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.
1705	0	a	He has no known drug allergies.
1706	0	a	He discontinued cigarette
1707	0	a	smoking years ago.
1708	0	a	On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.
1709	0	a	His pulse was
1710	0	a	56, afebrile.
1711	0	a	O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when
1712	0	a	I rechecked it, it was 95%.
1713	0	a	His weight was 221 lbs.
1714	0	a	He is in no
1715	0	a	respiratory distress at rest.
1716	0	a	His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
1717	0	a	a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
1718	0	a	His neck had no
1719	0	a	enlarged lymph nodes.
1720	0	a	Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
1721	0	a	left base with crackles.
1722	0	a	His right lung was clear.
1723	0	a	His heart
1724	0	a	was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
1725	0	a	murmur.
1726	0	a	His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.
1727	0	a	His
1728	0	a	extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.
1729	0	a	Pulmonary
1730	0	a	function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
1731	0	a	again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined
1732	0	a	restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
1733	0	a	His current
1734	0	a	vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
1735	0	a	December.
1736	0	a	He has no bronchodilator response.
1737	0	a	I took Mr. Joshi
1738	0	a	for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
1739	0	a	includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
1740	0	a	In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely
1741	0	a	mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
1742	0	a	However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on
1743	0	a	my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred
1744	0	a	him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
1745	0	a	Mr. Joshi had several
1746	0	a	questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
1747	0	a	recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
1748	0	a	I do
1749	0	a	not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
1750	0	a	corticosteroid for this gentleman.
1751	0	a	I do recommend that he get
1752	0	a	daily exercise.
1753	0	a	He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
1754	0	a	I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
1755	0	a	he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
1756	0	a	I have also
1757	0	a	confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
1758	0	a	His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
1759	0	a	defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for
1760	0	a	albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
1761	0	a	to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary 
1762	0	a	     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70
1763	0	a	vascular disease.
1764	0	a	However, we will certainly reassess this after
1765	0	a	his initial work-up.
1766	0	a	Thank you for referring this interesting
1767	0	a	patient.
1768	0	a	If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to
1769	0	a	call.

1939	0	a	Dear Dr. Yancy: 
1940	0	a	  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device.
1941	0	a	Her history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia.
1942	0	a	She is doing well from the cardiac perspective.
1943	0	a	She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years.
1944	0	a	She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago.
1945	0	a	"She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved."

2017	0	a	She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.
2018	0	a	Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain.
2019	0	a	If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan.
2020	0	a	We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
2021	0	a	We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.
2022	0	a	We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

2323	0	a	To Whom It May Concern:
2324	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
2325	3	a	As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.
2326	0	a	He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.
2327	0	a	This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
2328	0	a	Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.
2329	0	a	He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.
2330	0	a	He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
2331	0	a	He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
2332	0	a	He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.
2333	0	a	He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.
2334	3	a	Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.
2335	0	a	He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.
2336	0	a	Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
2337	3	a	Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.
2338	0	a	Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
2339	0	a	daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o.
2340	0	a	daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
2341	0	a	daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o.
2342	0	a	daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
2343	0	a	daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o.
2344	0	a	daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
2345	0	a	daily.
2346	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
2347	0	a	His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.
2348	0	a	He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
2349	0	a	He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
2350	0	a	He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
2351	0	a	On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.
2352	0	a	He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
2353	0	a	His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
2354	0	a	He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
2355	0	a	He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.
2356	0	a	His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.
2357	0	a	His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
2358	0	a	He has good distal pulsations.
2359	0	a	His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
2360	0	a	Laboratory values are not available today.
2361	0	a	ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
2362	0	a	He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
2363	0	a	No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
2364	0	a	He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.
2365	3	a	Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.
2366	0	a	This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.
2367	0	a	Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.
2368	0	a	However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.
2369	3	a	However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.
2370	0	a	As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.
2371	0	a	If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.
2372	0	a	This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.
2373	0	a	With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.
2374	0	a	As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o.
2375	0	a	This medication should be continued through all surgery.
2376	0	a	Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o.
2377	0	a	daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
2378	3	a	Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.
2379	2	a	His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
2380	0	a	I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
2381	0	a	With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.
2382	0	a	Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.
2383	0	a	We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.
2384	0	a	Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
2385	0	a	As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.
2386	0	a	I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
2387	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
2388	0	a	He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
2389	0	a	Thank you.

3903	0	a	Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
3904	0	a	History of Present Illness
3905	0	a	This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
3906	0	a	He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
3907	0	a	Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
3908	0	a	He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
3909	0	a	Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms.
3910	0	a	Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD.
3911	0	a	There was no PCI option available.
3912	0	a	He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted.
3913	0	a	Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
3914	0	a	He now presented for cath.
3915	0	a	Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
3916	0	a	The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
3917	0	a	The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
3918	0	a	LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
3919	0	a	RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
3920	0	a	The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
3921	0	a	The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
3922	0	a	The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
3923	0	a	He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

4025	1	a	HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
4026	0	a	She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.
4027	0	a	She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.
4028	0	a	She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.
4029	0	a	There is no operative report from the procedure.
4030	0	a	Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.
4031	0	a	Tissue appeared fairly healthy.
4032	0	a	She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.
4033	0	a	She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.
4034	0	a	She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.

4093	1	a	Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.
4094	0	a	The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
4095	0	a	If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.
4096	0	a	However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.
4097	0	a	After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.
4098	0	a	Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.
4099	0	a	Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
4100	0	a	We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.
4101	0	a	Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure.
4102	0	a	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results
4103	0	a	Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose
4104	0	a	Please obtain LFTs

4118	0	a	Dear Dr.  Osuna:
4119	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.

4655	2	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
4656	0	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
4657	0	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
4658	0	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
4659	0	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
4660	0	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
4661	0	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
4662	0	a	Slowly these lesions healed.
4663	0	a	Interim Issues:
4664	3	a	The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
4665	0	a	But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis.
4666	0	a	In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
4667	0	a	Recovering from surgery has been slow.
4668	0	a	But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
4669	0	a	She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home.
4670	0	a	She has had no recurrent chest pain.
4671	0	a	She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
4672	0	a	She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se.
4673	0	a	She healed well postoperatively.
4674	0	a	She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
4675	0	a	Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
4676	0	a	In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's.
4677	0	a	She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
4678	0	a	What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
4679	0	a	She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
4680	0	a	She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
4681	0	a	She has had no worsening swallowing.
4682	0	a	She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion.
4683	0	a	She sleeps on two pillows.
4684	0	a	She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
4685	0	a	She continues on omeprazole.

4908	0	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
4909	0	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
4910	0	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
4911	0	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
4912	0	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
4913	0	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
4914	0	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
4915	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
4916	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
4917	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
4918	0	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
4919	0	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
4920	0	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
4921	0	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
4922	0	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
4923	0	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
4924	0	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
4925	0	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
4926	0	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
4927	0	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
4928	0	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
4929	0	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
4930	0	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
4931	0	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
4932	0	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
4933	0	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
4934	0	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
4935	0	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
4936	0	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
4937	0	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
4938	0	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
4939	0	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
4940	0	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
4941	0	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
4942	0	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
4943	0	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
4944	0	a	He is unable to work.
4945	0	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
4946	0	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
4947	0	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
4948	0	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
4949	0	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
4950	0	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
4951	3	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
4952	0	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
4953	0	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
4954	0	a	His hair has now grown back.
4955	0	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
4956	0	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
4957	0	a	Eye contact is good.
4958	0	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
4959	0	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
4960	0	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
4961	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
4962	0	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
4963	0	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
4964	0	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
4965	0	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
4966	0	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
4967	0	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
4968	0	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
4969	0	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
4970	0	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
4971	0	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
4972	0	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
4973	0	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
4974	0	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
4975	0	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
4976	0	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
4977	0	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
4978	0	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
4979	0	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
4980	0	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
4981	0	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
4982	0	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
4983	0	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
4984	0	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
4985	0	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
4986	0	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.
