3486,His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.,Other,131-05.xml

3488,He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.,Other,131-05.xml
3489,"I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.",Other,131-05.xml
3490,He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.,Other,131-05.xml

3492,He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.,Other,131-05.xml
3493,He also has low platelets.,Other,131-05.xml
3494,The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.,Other,131-05.xml
3495,"It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.",Other,131-05.xml
3496,"He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.",Other,131-05.xml

3499,My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.,Other,131-05.xml
3500,He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.,Other,131-05.xml
3501,"I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.",Other,131-05.xml

5128,Dear Dr. Barron:,Other,138-04.xml
5129,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.,Other,138-04.xml
5130,I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.,Other,138-04.xml
5131,Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.,Other,138-04.xml
5132,"Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.",during DCT,138-04.xml
5133,"It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.",Other,138-04.xml
5134,"On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.",Other,138-04.xml
5135,She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.,Other,138-04.xml
5136,I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.,Other,138-04.xml
5137,"Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.",Other,138-04.xml
5138,"Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.",Other,138-04.xml
5139,"Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.",Other,138-04.xml

5152,"Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.",Other,138-04.xml
5153,Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.,Other,138-04.xml

5157,Her weight is 213 pounds.,Other,138-04.xml
5158,Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.,Other,138-04.xml

5160,The carotid upstrokes are full.,Other,138-04.xml
5161,Her lungs are clear to auscultation.,Other,138-04.xml

5164,"The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.",Other,138-04.xml
5165,Her extremities show no edema.,Other,138-04.xml
5166,Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.,Other,138-04.xml

5168,I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.,Other,138-04.xml
5169,"On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.",Other,138-04.xml
5170,She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.,Other,138-04.xml
5171,She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.,Other,138-04.xml
5172,There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.,Other,138-04.xml
5173,She has only mild mitral regurgitation.,Other,138-04.xml
5174,"In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.",Other,138-04.xml
5175,She did receive drug-eluting stents.,Other,138-04.xml
5176,The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.,Other,138-04.xml
5177,"What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.",Other,138-04.xml
5178,"From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.",Other,138-04.xml
5179,"She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.",Other,138-04.xml
5180,I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.,Other,138-04.xml
5181,"To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.",Other,138-04.xml
5182,We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.,Other,138-04.xml
5183,"In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.",Other,138-04.xml

5185,"In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.",Other,138-04.xml
5186,"Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.",Other,138-04.xml
5187,"After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.",Other,138-04.xml
5188,"However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.",Other,138-04.xml
5189,"She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.",Other,138-04.xml
5190,"The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.",Other,138-04.xml
5191,This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.,Other,138-04.xml
5192,"I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.",Other,138-04.xml

11184,Dear Dr. Pacheco:  ,Other,197-01.xml
11185,"I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently.",Other,197-01.xml
11186,Thank you for your kind referral.,Other,197-01.xml
11187,I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.,Other,197-01.xml
11188,Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.,Other,197-01.xml
11189,His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.,Other,197-01.xml
11190,This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.,Other,197-01.xml
11191,"Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left.",Other,197-01.xml
11192,At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.,Other,197-01.xml
11193,Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.,Other,197-01.xml
11194,"He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet.",Other,197-01.xml
11195,He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.,Other,197-01.xml
11196,"He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems.",Other,197-01.xml
11197,He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.,Other,197-01.xml
11198,"Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.",Other,197-01.xml
11199,"Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins.",Other,197-01.xml
11200,He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.,Other,197-01.xml
11201,"He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50.",during DCT,197-01.xml
11202,His glucose control by his history has been very good.,Other,197-01.xml
11203,"He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.",Other,197-01.xml
11204,"Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.",Other,197-01.xml
11205,He has no known drug allergies.,Other,197-01.xml
11206,"He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.",Other,197-01.xml
11207,His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.,Other,197-01.xml
11208,He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.,Other,197-01.xml
11209,"He has several children, all in good health.",Other,197-01.xml
11210,"On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.",Other,197-01.xml
11211,No carotid bruits could be appreciated.,Other,197-01.xml
11212,The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.,Other,197-01.xml
11213,"He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
11214,Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.,Other,197-01.xml
11215,Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.,Other,197-01.xml
11216,"The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
11217,Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.,Other,197-01.xml
11218,"On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.",Other,197-01.xml
11219,"There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
11220,"Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
11221,"In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.",Other,197-01.xml
11222,Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.,Other,197-01.xml
11223,"Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.",Other,197-01.xml
11224,"There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.",Other,197-01.xml
11225,Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.,Other,197-01.xml
11226,Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.,Other,197-01.xml
11227,"Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.",Other,197-01.xml
11228,There was no jaw jerk.,Other,197-01.xml
11229,Toes were downgoing bilaterally.,Other,197-01.xml
11230,Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.,Other,197-01.xml
11231,Those results were available for me today.,Other,197-01.xml
11232,"They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.",Other,197-01.xml
11233,Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.,Other,197-01.xml
11234,"There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.",Other,197-01.xml
11235,"Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.",Other,197-01.xml
11236,"With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration.",Other,197-01.xml
11237,"There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual.",Other,197-01.xml
11238,"In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon.",Other,197-01.xml
11239,"The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence.",Other,197-01.xml
11240,I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.,Other,197-01.xml
11241,"Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.",Other,197-01.xml
11242,"We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.",Other,197-01.xml
11243,"However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him.",Other,197-01.xml
11244,"Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem.",Other,197-01.xml
11245,"I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.",Other,197-01.xml
11246,If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.,Other,197-01.xml
11247,"Once again, thank you for your kind referral.",Other,197-01.xml

11596,"The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.",Other,198-02.xml
11597,"He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.",Other,198-02.xml
11598,The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.,Other,198-02.xml
11599,"Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.",Other,198-02.xml
11600,"The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.",Other,198-02.xml
11601,"Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).",Other,198-02.xml

11604,"The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.",Other,198-02.xml

15031,I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.,Other,209-01.xml
15032,His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.,Other,209-01.xml

15041,We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.,Other,209-01.xml
15042,This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.,Other,209-01.xml
15043,"After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.",Other,209-01.xml

15736,Dear Dr. Ussery:,Other,211-02.xml
15737,I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.,Other,211-02.xml
15738,"As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.",Other,211-02.xml
15739,He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.,Other,211-02.xml
15740,"By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.",Other,211-02.xml
15741,"He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.",Other,211-02.xml
15742,"That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.",Other,211-02.xml
15743,He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.,Other,211-02.xml
15744,"The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.",Other,211-02.xml
15745,Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.,Other,211-02.xml
15746,He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.,Other,211-02.xml
15747,"This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.",Other,211-02.xml
15748,A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.,Other,211-02.xml
15749,He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.,Other,211-02.xml
15750,"A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.",Other,211-02.xml
15751,This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.,Other,211-02.xml
15752,His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.,Other,211-02.xml
15753,"Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.",Other,211-02.xml
15754,He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.,Other,211-02.xml
15755,"Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.",Other,211-02.xml
15756,He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.,Other,211-02.xml

15761,"Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.",Other,211-02.xml
15762,He was evaluated and released.,Other,211-02.xml
15763,He never had any further testing.,Other,211-02.xml
15764,"He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.",Other,211-02.xml
15765,"Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.",during DCT,211-02.xml
15766,"His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.",Other,211-02.xml
15767,He has no known drug allergies.,Other,211-02.xml

15775,He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.,Other,211-02.xml
15776,"On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.",Other,211-02.xml
15777,His heart rate is 60 and regular.,Other,211-02.xml
15778,"In general, he is in no apparent distress.",Other,211-02.xml
15779,His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.,Other,211-02.xml
15780,"His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.",Other,211-02.xml
15781,His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.,Other,211-02.xml
15782,"He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.",Other,211-02.xml
15783,His abdomen is benign.,Other,211-02.xml

15785,"On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.",Other,211-02.xml
15786,"His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.",Other,211-02.xml
15787,His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.,Other,211-02.xml

15791,His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.,Other,211-02.xml
15792,"He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.",Other,211-02.xml
15793,Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.,Other,211-02.xml
15794,"He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.",Other,211-02.xml
15795,His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.,Other,211-02.xml
15796,His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.,Other,211-02.xml
15797,There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.,Other,211-02.xml
15798,His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.,Other,211-02.xml
15799,"In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.",Other,211-02.xml
15800,"Also, his systolic function has improved over time.",Other,211-02.xml
15801,I think there are two processes going on.,Other,211-02.xml
15802,One is coronary artery disease.,Other,211-02.xml
15803,"Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.",Other,211-02.xml
15804,The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.,Other,211-02.xml
15805,"Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.",Other,211-02.xml
15806,"He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.",Other,211-02.xml
15807,I suspect that this is myocarditis.,Other,211-02.xml
15808,"Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.",Other,211-02.xml
15809,It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.,Other,211-02.xml
15810,"From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.",Other,211-02.xml
15811,"He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.",Other,211-02.xml
15812,"For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.",Other,211-02.xml
15813,His LDL goal will be less than 100.,Other,211-02.xml
15814,"He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.",Other,211-02.xml
15815,His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.,Other,211-02.xml
15816,I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.,Other,211-02.xml
15817,I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.,Other,211-02.xml
15818,Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.,Other,211-02.xml
15819,"The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.",Other,211-02.xml

30317,The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.,Other,349-01.xml
30318,"In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.",Other,349-01.xml
30319,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.,Other,349-01.xml
30320,"This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.",Other,349-01.xml
30321,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.,Other,349-01.xml
30322,"She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.",Other,349-01.xml
30323,The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.,Other,349-01.xml
30324,She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.,Other,349-01.xml
30325,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.,Other,349-01.xml
30326,Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.,Other,349-01.xml
30327,"Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.",Other,349-01.xml

30329,"On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.",Other,349-01.xml
30330,MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.,Other,349-01.xml
30331,The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.,Other,349-01.xml

30334,"Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.",Other,349-01.xml
30335,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.,Other,349-01.xml
30336,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.,Other,349-01.xml
30337,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.,Other,349-01.xml
30338,There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.,Other,349-01.xml

30361,There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.,Other,349-01.xml

30382,I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.,Other,349-01.xml
30383,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.,Other,349-01.xml

32338,"Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee, a 51-year-old female patient with the history of seizure disorder, hypertension, borderline diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms, and depressive disorder, who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent polysomnographic abnormalities.",during DCT,374-01.xml
32339,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As you already know, Ms. Mckee describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses, and describes a ""restless sleep"", but only relatively recently (over the last five months, particularly after 12/26 of last year).",Other,374-01.xml
32340,She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.,Other,374-01.xml
32341,"She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves ""sleeping around the clock"" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration.",Other,374-01.xml
32342,The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.,Other,374-01.xml
32343,"She states that she is so tired that she can ""fall asleep right after breakfast"".",Other,374-01.xml
32344,She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.,Other,374-01.xml
32345,"Ms. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy.",Other,374-01.xml
32346,"She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m.",Other,374-01.xml
32347,and three tablets po q.h.s.,Other,374-01.xml
32348,"While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of ""diffuse"" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below).",Other,374-01.xml

33504,Dear Harry and Yair:,Other,377-01.xml
33505,My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.,Other,377-01.xml
33506,"As you know, she is just 52 years of age.",Other,377-01.xml
33507,"Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.",during DCT,377-01.xml
33508,She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.,Other,377-01.xml
33509,She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.,Other,377-01.xml
33510,She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.,Other,377-01.xml
33511,On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.,Other,377-01.xml
33512,"This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.",Other,377-01.xml
33513,In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.,Other,377-01.xml
33514,There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.,Other,377-01.xml
33515,She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.,Other,377-01.xml
33516,"By last spring, i.e.",Other,377-01.xml
33517,a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.,Other,377-01.xml
33518,She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.,Other,377-01.xml
33519,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.,Other,377-01.xml
33520,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.,Other,377-01.xml
33521,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???,Other,377-01.xml
33522,length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.,Other,377-01.xml
33523,Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.,Other,377-01.xml
33524,She has sought an opinion here in this regard.,Other,377-01.xml
33525,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.,Other,377-01.xml
33526,On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.,Other,377-01.xml
33527,Pulse was 70 and regular.,Other,377-01.xml
33528,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.,Other,377-01.xml
33529,"She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.",Other,377-01.xml
33530,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.,Other,377-01.xml
33531,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.,Other,377-01.xml
33532,This is of course a very unhappy situation.,Other,377-01.xml
33533,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.,Other,377-01.xml
33534,However I am not absolutely ruling this out.,Other,377-01.xml
33535,I would suggest the following.,Other,377-01.xml
33536,"Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.",Other,377-01.xml
33537,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.,Other,377-01.xml
33538,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.,Other,377-01.xml
33539,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.,Other,377-01.xml
33540,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.,Other,377-01.xml
33541,My thanks once again.,Other,377-01.xml
