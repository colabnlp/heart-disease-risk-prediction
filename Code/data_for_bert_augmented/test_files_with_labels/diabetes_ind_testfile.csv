2277,His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.,Other,131-05.xml
2278,There are a number of factors involved here.,Other,131-05.xml
2279,He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.,Other,131-05.xml
2280,"I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.",Other,131-05.xml
2281,He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.,Other,131-05.xml

2283,He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.,mention,131-05.xml
2284,He also has low platelets.,Other,131-05.xml
2285,The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.,Other,131-05.xml
2286,"It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.",Other,131-05.xml
2287,"He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.",Other,131-05.xml

2289,He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.,Other,131-05.xml
2290,My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.,Other,131-05.xml
2291,He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.,Other,131-05.xml
2292,"I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.",Other,131-05.xml
2293,"I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.",Other,131-05.xml
2294,Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.,Other,131-05.xml

8628,Dear Dr. Pacheco:  ,Other,197-01.xml
8629,"I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently.",Other,197-01.xml
8630,Thank you for your kind referral.,Other,197-01.xml
8631,I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.,Other,197-01.xml
8632,Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.,Other,197-01.xml
8633,His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.,Other,197-01.xml
8634,This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.,Other,197-01.xml
8635,"Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left.",Other,197-01.xml
8636,At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.,Other,197-01.xml
8637,Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.,Other,197-01.xml
8638,"He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet.",Other,197-01.xml
8639,He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.,Other,197-01.xml
8640,"He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems.",Other,197-01.xml
8641,He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.,Other,197-01.xml
8642,"Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.",Other,197-01.xml
8643,"Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins.",Other,197-01.xml
8644,He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.,Other,197-01.xml
8645,"He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50.",mention,197-01.xml
8646,His glucose control by his history has been very good.,Other,197-01.xml
8647,"He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.",Other,197-01.xml
8648,"Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.",Other,197-01.xml
8649,He has no known drug allergies.,Other,197-01.xml
8650,"He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.",Other,197-01.xml
8651,His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.,Other,197-01.xml
8652,He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.,Other,197-01.xml
8653,"He has several children, all in good health.",Other,197-01.xml
8654,"On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.",Other,197-01.xml
8655,No carotid bruits could be appreciated.,Other,197-01.xml
8656,The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.,Other,197-01.xml
8657,"He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
8658,Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.,Other,197-01.xml
8659,Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.,Other,197-01.xml
8660,"The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
8661,Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.,Other,197-01.xml
8662,"On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.",Other,197-01.xml
8663,"There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
8664,"Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.",Other,197-01.xml
8665,"In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.",Other,197-01.xml
8666,Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.,Other,197-01.xml
8667,"Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.",Other,197-01.xml
8668,"There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.",Other,197-01.xml
8669,Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.,Other,197-01.xml
8670,Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.,Other,197-01.xml
8671,"Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.",Other,197-01.xml
8672,There was no jaw jerk.,Other,197-01.xml
8673,Toes were downgoing bilaterally.,Other,197-01.xml
8674,Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.,Other,197-01.xml
8675,Those results were available for me today.,Other,197-01.xml
8676,"They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.",Other,197-01.xml
8677,Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.,Other,197-01.xml
8678,"There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.",Other,197-01.xml
8679,"Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.",mention,197-01.xml
8680,"With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration.",Other,197-01.xml
8681,"There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual.",Other,197-01.xml
8682,"In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon.",mention,197-01.xml
8683,"The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence.",Other,197-01.xml
8684,I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.,Other,197-01.xml
8685,"Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.",Other,197-01.xml

9040,"The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.",Other,198-02.xml

10892,We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.,Other,202-03.xml
10893,We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.,Other,202-03.xml

17851,"It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.",Other,237-01.xml

17853,"Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.",Other,237-01.xml
17854,"When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.",Other,237-01.xml

17856,"Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.",Other,237-01.xml
17857,Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.,Other,237-01.xml

17908,Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.,Other,237-01.xml
17909,"Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.",Other,237-01.xml
17910,"On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.",Other,237-01.xml
17911,"We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.",mention,237-01.xml

17913,"CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.",Other,237-01.xml
17914,"Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.",Other,237-01.xml
17915,It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.,Other,237-01.xml
17916,"Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.",Other,237-01.xml
17917,We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.,Other,237-01.xml

17919,He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.,Other,237-01.xml

27807,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.,Other,349-01.xml
27808,"She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.",Other,349-01.xml

27821,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.,Other,349-01.xml

27869,I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.,Other,349-01.xml

30167,   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.,Other,375-03.xml
30168,Interval History:,Other,375-03.xml
30169,   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.,Other,375-03.xml
30170,"His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.",Other,375-03.xml
30171,Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.,Other,375-03.xml
30172,"He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.",mention,375-03.xml
30173,"Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.",Other,375-03.xml
30174,"He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.",Other,375-03.xml
30175,"The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.",Other,375-03.xml
30176,"The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.",Other,375-03.xml
30177,"Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.",Other,375-03.xml
30178,"The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.",Other,375-03.xml
30179,"His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.",Other,375-03.xml
30180,It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.,Other,375-03.xml
30181,"At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.",Other,375-03.xml
30182,Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.,Other,375-03.xml
30183,"The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.",Other,375-03.xml
30184,"Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.",Other,375-03.xml

30786,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.,Other,377-01.xml
30787,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.,Other,377-01.xml
30788,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???,Other,377-01.xml
30789,length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.,Other,377-01.xml
30790,Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.,Other,377-01.xml
30791,She has sought an opinion here in this regard.,Other,377-01.xml
30792,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.,Other,377-01.xml
30793,On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.,Other,377-01.xml
30794,Pulse was 70 and regular.,Other,377-01.xml
30795,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.,Other,377-01.xml
30796,"She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.",Other,377-01.xml
30797,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.,Other,377-01.xml
30798,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.,Other,377-01.xml
30799,This is of course a very unhappy situation.,Other,377-01.xml
30800,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.,Other,377-01.xml
30801,However I am not absolutely ruling this out.,Other,377-01.xml
30802,I would suggest the following.,Other,377-01.xml
30803,"Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.",Other,377-01.xml
30804,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.,Other,377-01.xml
30805,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.,Other,377-01.xml
30806,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.,Other,377-01.xml
30807,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.,Other,377-01.xml
