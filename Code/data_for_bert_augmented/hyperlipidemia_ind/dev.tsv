425	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
426	0	a	1.
427	0	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
428	0	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
429	0	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
430	0	a	2.
431	0	a	BPH.
432	0	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
433	0	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
434	0	a	3.
435	0	a	Hypertension.
436	0	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
437	0	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
438	0	a	4.
439	0	a	COPD.
440	0	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
441	0	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
442	0	a	5.
443	0	a	Elevated cholesterol.
444	0	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
445	0	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
446	0	a	6.
447	0	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
448	0	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
449	0	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
450	0	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

644	0	a	PO q.h.s.
645	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
646	0	a	follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
647	0	a	depression.
648	0	a	Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
649	0	a	complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
650	0	a	Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
651	0	a	day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s.
652	0	a	Zantac and scheduled for a 
653	0	a	upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
654	0	a	pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
655	0	a	study.
656	0	a	She is scheduled later this month.
657	0	a	She has no new complaints, 
658	0	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
659	0	a	it over the past two days.
660	0	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
661	0	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
662	0	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
663	0	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
664	0	a	the morning.
665	0	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
666	0	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
667	0	a	that she has been taking them.
668	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
669	0	a	this is true or not.
670	0	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
671	0	a	She says 
672	0	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
673	0	a	She was recently started on 
674	0	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
675	0	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
676	0	a	a month.
677	0	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
678	0	a	She says overall 
679	0	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
680	0	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
681	0	a	We again discussed the 
682	0	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
683	0	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
684	0	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
685	0	a	frequency.
686	0	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
687	0	a	rest.

690	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
691	0	a	Her 
692	0	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
693	0	a	Her weight today is 
694	0	a	249lb.
695	0	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.
696	0	a	Her JVP is not visible at 90 
697	0	a	degrees.
698	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
699	0	a	Her lungs are clear to 
700	0	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
701	0	a	positive S1, S2.
702	0	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
703	0	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
704	0	a	Her finger stick 
705	0	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
706	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
707	0	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
708	0	a	Diabetes.
709	0	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
710	0	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
711	0	a	Finger stick in the 
712	0	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
713	0	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
714	0	a	     over the past couple of months.
715	0	a	In any event, she most likely need 
716	0	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
717	0	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
718	0	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
719	0	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
720	0	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
721	2	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
722	0	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
723	0	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
724	0	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
725	0	a	Coronary disease.
726	0	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
727	0	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
728	0	a	as she did have room to go 
729	0	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
730	0	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
731	0	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
732	0	a	Again, reinforced the 
733	0	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
734	0	a	     again as I have in the past.
735	0	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
736	0	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
737	0	a	I told her she should take the 
738	0	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
739	0	a	Health maintenance.
740	0	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
741	0	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
742	0	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
743	0	a	Additionally, I 
744	0	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
745	0	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
746	0	a	I also stressed the 
747	0	a	06  Colgate Road                             Youngman, Cody
748	0	a	Page 3
749	0	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
750	0	a	She says she is scheduled 
751	0	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
752	0	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

1398	0	a	MRN:     8514931
1399	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian
1400	0	a	female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness.
1401	0	a	Her daughter,
1402	0	a	who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today.
1403	0	a	Apparently, for
1404	0	a	"many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled"""
1405	0	a	when she walks.
1406	0	a	This never occurs when lying down or sitting.
1407	0	a	It is only when she is
1408	0	a	walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or
1409	0	a	backward.
1410	0	a	At times, she does visibly veer when she walks.
1411	0	a	She has had one fall a
1412	0	a	number of months ago when she broke her wrist.
1413	0	a	She has not had any subsequent
1414	0	a	falls.
1415	0	a	There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,
1416	0	a	numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache.
1417	0	a	She actually
1418	0	a	feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it
1419	0	a	was a little more severe.
1420	0	a	Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.
1421	0	a	Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms.
1422	0	a	Review of other systems notable for general fatigue.
1423	0	a	Otherwise unremarkable.
1424	0	a	No
1425	0	a	chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
1426	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

1430	0	a	FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease.
1431	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece.
1432	0	a	She neither drinks nor
1433	0	a	smokes.
1434	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,
1435	0	a	72-year-old female.
1436	0	a	BP 140/84.
1437	0	a	Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,

1439	0	a	On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift.
1440	0	a	Good
1441	0	a	power throughout upper and lower extremities.
1442	0	a	She does, however, seem mildly
1443	0	a	bradykinetic diffusely.
1444	0	a	Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric.
1445	0	a	Amplitude
1446	0	a	is normal for finger tapping.

1448	0	a	Sensory exam with
1449	0	a	mild vibratory loss in the toes.
1450	0	a	Finger-to-nose testing intact.
1451	0	a	Foot-tapping decreased
1452	0	a	bilaterally.
1453	0	a	Romberg sway.
1454	0	a	Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to
1455	0	a	either side.
1456	0	a	She is unable to perform tandem.
1457	0	a	DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+
1458	0	a	ankle jerks.
1459	0	a	Babinski flexor bilaterally.
1460	0	a	DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter
1461	0	a	hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral
1462	0	a	pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right
1463	0	a	internal capsule and bilateral thalami.
1464	0	a	Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the
1465	0	a	anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the
1466	0	a	posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment
1467	0	a	stenosis of the basilar artery.

1470	0	a	bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits.
1471	0	a	LFT's normal except SGOT
1472	0	a	elevated at 46.
1473	0	a	IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and
1474	0	a	hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady.
1475	0	a	She is
1476	0	a	symptomatic only when she walks.
1477	0	a	Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
1478	0	a	toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the
1479	0	a	wide-based, at times veering gait.
1480	0	a	It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are
1481	0	a	multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.
1482	0	a	It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given
1483	0	a	that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she
1484	0	a	is concerned about.
1485	0	a	However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,
1486	0	a	she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she
1487	0	a	became hypotensive.
1488	0	a	As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding
1489	0	a	Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she
1490	0	a	can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine.
1491	0	a	I will see her in follow up in two
1492	0	a	months to see how she is doing.
1493	0	a	May also consider checking CBC, given her
1494	0	a	symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

2132	0	a	Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status.
2133	0	a	Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
2134	0	a	He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
2135	0	a	This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia.
2136	0	a	Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process.
2137	0	a	Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure.
2138	0	a	Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
2139	0	a	Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.
2140	0	a	Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
2141	0	a	amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides.
2142	2	a	Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.
2143	0	a	Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.
2144	0	a	Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
2145	0	a	Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.
2146	0	a	PLAN
2147	0	a	#) Acture Renal Failure
2148	0	a	-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
2149	0	a	-D/c naproxen use.
2150	0	a	-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
2151	0	a	If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
2152	0	a	Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.
2153	0	a	#) DM
2154	0	a	-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

2298	0	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
2299	0	a	was positive.
2300	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
2301	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
2302	0	a	She had 1mm 
2303	0	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
2304	0	a	disease.
2305	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
2306	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
2307	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
2308	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
2309	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
2310	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
2311	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
2312	0	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
2313	0	a	She 
2314	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
2315	0	a	for taking it.
2316	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
2317	0	a	on atenolol.
2318	0	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
2319	0	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
2320	0	a	I will continue to work 
2321	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
2322	0	a	Her other risk 
2323	2	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
2324	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
2325	0	a	Her 
2326	0	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
2327	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
2328	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
2329	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
2330	0	a	hospital.

2345	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
2346	0	a	She has been doing very well.
2347	0	a	She has been exercising and has lost from 
2348	0	a	200 to 170 pounds.
2349	0	a	She is feeling very well.
2350	0	a	Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.
2351	0	a	He did not find the 
2352	0	a	first ETT acceptable.
2353	0	a	The second ETT was grossly positive.
2354	0	a	As a result 
2355	0	a	of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
2356	0	a	atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
2357	0	a	nitrate.
2358	0	a	She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
2359	0	a	pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
2360	2	a	She did have hyperlipidemia.
2361	0	a	We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
2362	0	a	provided some control.
2363	1	a	However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
2364	0	a	is not an excellent ratio.
2365	0	a	Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
2366	0	a	limits.
2367	0	a	She also has right shoulder lipoma.
2368	0	a	This has become apparent since she 
2369	0	a	lost so much weight.
2370	0	a	She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
2371	0	a	recommended Dr. Dawson.
2372	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
2373	0	a	120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.
2374	0	a	Neck is supple.
2375	0	a	There 
2376	0	a	is no lymphadenopathy.
2377	0	a	Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
2378	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
2379	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
2380	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
2381	0	a	Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.
2382	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  None today.
2383	0	a	Page 2
2384	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
2385	0	a	1.
2386	0	a	CAD.
2387	0	a	We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.
2388	0	a	I also 
2389	0	a	gave her nitroglycerine.
2390	0	a	We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
2391	0	a	continue her atenolol.
2392	0	a	She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
2393	0	a	Premarin and Synthroid.
2394	0	a	2.
2395	0	a	Weight loss.
2396	0	a	She will continue to exercise.
2397	0	a	I suspect she is going 
2398	0	a	to lose more weight.
2399	0	a	This is excellent.
2400	0	a	3.
2401	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
2402	0	a	Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
2403	0	a	cardiac catheterization.
2404	0	a	It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
2405	0	a	this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
2406	0	a	She is going to 
2407	0	a	delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
2408	0	a	done on this variety of medical issues.

2961	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
2962	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.

2982	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
2983	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
2984	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
2985	0	a	Briefly:
2986	2	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
2987	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
2988	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
2989	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
2990	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
2991	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
2992	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
2993	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
2994	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

3104	0	a	Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
3105	0	a	I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
3106	0	a	The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.
3107	0	a	The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
3108	0	a	The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
3109	0	a	He has never worn compression stockings.
3110	0	a	He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
3111	0	a	To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
3112	0	a	The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT.
3113	0	a	There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
3114	0	a	He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
3115	0	a	He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.
3116	0	a	The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
3117	0	a	His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.
3118	0	a	The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.
3119	0	a	The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
3120	0	a	He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.
3121	2	a	His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
3122	0	a	On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
3123	0	a	He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
3124	0	a	He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
3125	0	a	He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
3126	0	a	There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
3127	0	a	He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.
3128	0	a	His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
3129	0	a	On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
3130	0	a	He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.
3131	0	a	He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
3132	0	a	He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.
3133	0	a	The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
3134	0	a	The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
3135	0	a	The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
3136	0	a	It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.
3137	0	a	In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.
3138	0	a	In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.
3139	0	a	In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
3140	0	a	Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
3141	0	a	In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.
3142	0	a	Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
3143	0	a	I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
3144	0	a	Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
3145	0	a	This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.
3146	0	a	All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.
3147	0	a	The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
3148	0	a	With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
3149	0	a	Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.
3150	0	a	If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
3151	0	a	I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
3152	0	a	I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
3153	0	a	I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.
3154	0	a	I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
3155	0	a	It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
3156	0	a	If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.
3157	0	a	Sincerely,
3158	0	a	Michael D. Roe, M.D.

3380	0	a	Name:  Xochilt Vuong
3381	0	a	MRN:  6398353
3382	0	a	REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.
3383	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 
3384	0	a	going back more than 10 years.
3385	2	a	She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 
3386	0	a	over approximately the same period of time.
3387	0	a	She has a complicated history 
3388	0	a	including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.
3389	0	a	Her 
3390	0	a	creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 
3391	0	a	1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 
3392	0	a	obtained on July 06, 2064.
3393	0	a	She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.
3394	0	a	Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 
3395	0	a	at 81.
3396	0	a	Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 
3397	0	a	proteinuria since that time.
3398	0	a	Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 
3399	0	a	March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 
3400	0	a	obstruction, stones, or masses.
3401	0	a	She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
3402	0	a	She does 
3403	0	a	not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 
3404	0	a	for any proliferative retinopathy.
3405	0	a	Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 
3406	0	a	almost constant nausea.
3407	0	a	She vomits rarely.
3408	0	a	Her weight has fallen by about 20 
3409	0	a	pounds.
3410	0	a	She is slightly constipated.
3411	0	a	She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.
3412	0	a	She 
3413	0	a	is not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.
3414	0	a	"Her medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, ""statins,"" and a rather "
3415	0	a	large dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.

3436	0	a	Lipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD 
3437	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 
3438	0	a	reasonably comfortable.
3439	0	a	She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 
3440	0	a	which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
3441	0	a	Her blood pressure in 
3442	0	a	the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.
3443	0	a	Her chest has a few basal 
3444	0	a	crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
3445	0	a	JVP fills below the 
3446	0	a	sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 
3447	0	a	sternal border.
3448	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
3449	0	a	There is no renal tenderness.
3450	0	a	Extremities have no edema.
3451	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
3452	0	a	10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
3453	0	a	The 
3454	0	a	proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 
3455	0	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
3456	0	a	It would be useful to know 
3457	0	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
3458	0	a	It is, of course, also 
3459	0	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
3460	0	a	Their symmetry and 
3461	0	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
3462	0	a	The ACE 
3463	0	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
3464	0	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
3465	0	a	Her loss of appetite and 
3466	0	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
3467	0	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
3468	0	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
3469	0	a	hyperlipidemia.
3470	0	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
3471	0	a	It think it 
3472	0	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
3473	0	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
3474	0	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
3475	0	a	If, of course, shortness of 
3476	0	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
3477	0	a	reasonable.
3478	0	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
3479	0	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
3480	0	a	requirement for Lasix.
3481	0	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
3482	0	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
3483	0	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
3484	0	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
3485	0	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
3486	0	a	Aranesp).
3487	0	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
3488	0	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
3489	0	a	If so, the 
3490	0	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
3491	0	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
3492	0	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
3493	0	a	It would 
3494	0	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
3495	0	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
3496	0	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
3497	0	a	a need for it arises.
3498	0	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
3499	0	a	done in the next few months.
3500	0	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
3501	0	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
3502	0	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
3503	0	a	these measures as necessary.
3504	0	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
3505	0	a	Wanda
3506	0	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
3507	0	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
3508	0	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
3509	0	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

3662	0	a	Reason for visit:
3663	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
3664	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
3665	0	a	Interval History:
3666	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
3667	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
3668	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
3669	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
3670	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
3671	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
3672	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
3673	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
3674	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
3675	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
3676	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
3677	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
3678	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
3679	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
3680	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
3681	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
3682	0	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
3683	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
3684	0	a	Lasix 20mg
3685	0	a	Toprol XL 50mg
3686	0	a	ASA 325mg
3687	0	a	Zestril 20mg
3688	0	a	Lantus 10 units hs
3689	0	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
3690	0	a	Multivitamin
3691	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
3692	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
3693	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.
3694	0	a	Past medical history:

3733	0	a	Impression:
3734	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
3735	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
3736	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
3737	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
3738	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
3739	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
3740	0	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
3741	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.
