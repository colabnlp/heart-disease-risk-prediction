84	Sternal pain.
85	History of Present Illness
86	71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80.
87	He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed.
88	The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath.
89	No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem.
90	No variation with food.
91	No change with position (e.g., leaning forward).
92	Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.
93	No radiation to the jaw or arm.
94	The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).
95	ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail.
96	He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

152	Lab Test
153	ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis.
154	IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF.
155	Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.
156	Impression
157	Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago.
158	Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site.
159	No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection.
160	Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause.
161	Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.
162	Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:
163	Plan
164	- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low
165	- check CXR
166	- send ESR, CBC/Diff
167	- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done
168	- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware
169	- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

247	Dear Dr. Gordon:
248	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
249	As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.
250	His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.
251	Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.
252	He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
253	The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.
254	We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.
255	He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.
256	However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.
257	He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.
258	Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
259	The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.
260	The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.
261	The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.
262	The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.
263	In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.
264	However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.
265	I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.
266	In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.
267	Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.
268	Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.
269	I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.
270	I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.
271	If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
272	Sincerely,

286	Dear Dr. Swanson:
287	I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.
288	He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.
289	He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.
290	Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.
291	He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.
292	He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.
293	His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.
294	Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.
295	He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.
296	We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.
297	He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.
298	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
299	Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

310	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.
311	I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.
312	Please see his note for
313	further details.
314	I confirm that I have interviewed and examined
315	the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and
316	discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.
317	History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says
318	yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.
319	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
320	gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.
321	He has indwelling
322	Foley catheter.
323	He was transported from nursing home to ED as he
324	has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.
325	Per EMS, they were
326	told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased
327	POs today.
328	He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.
329	He
330	then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more
331	awake and alert.
332	He is telling the paramedics that he is at his
333	baseline.
334	He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.
335	No chest
336	pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers
337	or chills.
338	He reports that he is able to discern when he has
339	abdominal pain.
340	He has intact sensation.
341	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.
342	In addition, CAD, diabetes,
343	hypertension, CHF.
344	Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.
345	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.
346	He does not drink.
347	He is at
348	a nursing home.
349	He is married.
350	FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.
351	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.
352	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no
353	distress.
354	Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure
355	102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.
356	HEENT exam: 
357	Normocephalic and atraumatic.
358	Neck:  Supple.
359	He has coarse
360	upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.
361	Heart is regular
362	rate and rhythm.
363	His abdomen is slightly distended.
364	He is
365	nontender.
366	He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,
367	no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower
368	extremities.
369	He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.
370	The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his
371	urinary tract infection.
372	His urine and his catheter was cloudy.
373	Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the
374	lab, the patient had his catheter changed.

972	"	Reason for visit:"
973	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up.
974	Interval History:
975	   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.
976	He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.
977	He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.
978	At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.
979	He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.
980	He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.
981	His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.
982	Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.
983	He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.
984	He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.
985	He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.
986	A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.
987	The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.
988	On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.
989	A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.
990	Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.
991	An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.
992	HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.
993	His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit.
994	ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.
995	He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim.
996	He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.
997	With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.
998	His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA.
999	He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder.
1000	He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.
1001	Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well.
1002	He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.
1003	He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.
1004	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope.
1005	He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss.
1006	He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.
1007	He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.
1008	The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.
1009	He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.

1077	   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis.
1078	The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.
1079	At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF.
1080	HE has evidence of severe TR on exam.
1081	From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.
1082	His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.
1083	PLAN:
1084	1.
1085	PVE endocarditis.
1086	He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement.
1087	He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID.
1088	We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today.

1306	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.
1307	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with
1308	end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with
1309	bleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for
1310	dialysis that started today at dialysis.
1311	When the patient pulled
1312	up her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed.
1313	Blood pressure is 112/60.
1314	The bleeding can be controlled with
1315	compression and so she presented to the Emergency Department
1316	where she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.
1317	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic
1318	stenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and
1319	tricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,
1320	foot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,
1321	secondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery
1322	disease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of
1323	35-40%.
1324	PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract
1325	surgery, ovarian cyst removal.
1326	SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.
1327	She
1328	is retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.
1329	FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.
1330	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
1331	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital
1332	signs.
1333	She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest
1334	examination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over
1335	the fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would
1336	not controlled with pressure.
1337	LABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.
1338	Chem-7
1339	is otherwise normal.
1340	Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.
1341	Chest x-ray
1342	shows no acute disease.
1343	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair
1344	her fistula.
1345	She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle
1346	nature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her
1347	dialysis appointment and so she is transferred from here with her
1348	daughter to the EHCC Dialysis Unit to undergo full dialysis.
1349	PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding aVF and end-stage renal disease.
1350	DISPOSITION:  She is discharged in satisfactory condition.

1373	An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.
1374	His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.
1375	A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.
1376	The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.
1377	His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.
1378	The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.

1648	Dear Thomas:
1649	  Thank you very much for referring Mr.
1650	Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
1651	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
1652	Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
1653	The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
1654	After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.
1655	It has been progressive over the last several months.
1656	He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
1657	He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.
1658	He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.
1659	Past medical history:
1660	   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.
1661	Hypertension.

1685	There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.
1686	Social history:
1687	   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.
1688	He does not drink alcohol.
1689	He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
1690	Review of systems:
1691	   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.
1692	He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
1693	He denies hematochezia.
1694	He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.

1697	He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
1698	Physical examination:
1699	-Pulse:   55 and regular
1700	-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
1701	-resp.
1702	rate:   12 and unlabored
1703	-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.
1704	Mucous membranes are moist.

1708	Have a normal upstroke.
1709	JVP is less than 7 cm of water
1710	-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
1711	He does have low dullness in both bases
1712	-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
1713	He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
1714	-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
1715	No organomegaly.
1716	No pulsatile masses
1717	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
1718	He has no pedal edema.
1719	He has no clubbing or cyanosis
1720	Procedures:
1721	Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
1722	His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
1723	Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
1724	He had no chest pain.
1725	Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
1726	The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
1727	EKG:
1728	    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
1729	Selected recent labs:
1730	 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.
1731	Assessment and plan:
1732	   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096.
1733	His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
1734	There are a number of factors involved here.
1735	He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
1736	I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath.
1737	He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
1738	He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
1739	He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
1740	He also has low platelets.
1741	The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
1742	It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.
1743	He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time.
1744	Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
1745	He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
1746	My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
1747	He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
1748	I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization.
1749	I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia.
1750	Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
1751	Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

1775	RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson
1776	     MR#471-90-84-7
1777	Dear Dr. Geiger:
1778	Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a
1779	preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071.
1780	As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
1781	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease.
1782	She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and
1783	brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has
1784	increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and
1785	she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September
1786	of this year.
1787	In terms of her cardiac history, she was well
1788	until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath
1789	and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart
1790	failure.
1791	At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which
1792	revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to
1793	shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a
1794	dilated left ventricle.
1795	In addition, she had an echo in June of
1796	2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral
1797	regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction.
1798	She has never been hospitalized since that time for her
1799	congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good
1800	result.
1801	She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or
1802	claudication.
1803	She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.
1804	In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her
1805	recollection.
1806	She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house
1807	and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs.
1808	She is
1809	able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty
1810	from chest

1813	pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops
1814	secondary to fatigue.
1815	Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
1816	CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule.
1817	She has never had
1818	surgery.
1819	Her family history is significant for a mother who died
1820	of myocardial infarction at the age of 55.
1821	Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for
1822	40 years and quit four years ago.
1823	She denies alcohol, intravenous
1824	drugs or cocaine use.
1825	She lives with her husband and briefly
1826	worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.
1827	She
1828	has no known drug allergies.
1829	Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril
1830	50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po
1831	QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily
1832	and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.
1833	On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in
1834	her left arm and 165/70 in her right.
1835	Her heart rate was 104 when
1836	I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today.
1837	Her JVP was 7
1838	centimeters.
1839	Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid
1840	bruits.
1841	Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles.
1842	Her
1843	heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with
1844	occasional ectopic beats.
1845	She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6
1846	systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without
1847	radiation.
1848	Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds.
1849	extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.
1850	Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.
1851	She has a
1852	diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin
1853	effects.
1854	She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old
1855	anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.
1856	In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,
1857	hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease
1858	with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,
1859	likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial
1860	infarction, although she has never undergone heart
1861	catheterization.
1862	She is currently undergoing evaluation for a
1863	thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.
1864	MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071
1865	Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 
1866	given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
1867	since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with
1868	imaging.
1869	If this is similar to her previous study showing only
1870	fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she
1871	will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative
1872	myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is
1873	well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having
1874	Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection
1875	fraction.
1876	She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection
1877	As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation
1878	and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or
1879	rhythm.
1880	Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days
1881	prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after
1882	surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons
1883	as to how may days she should wait after surgery before
1884	restarting that medication.
1885	She will otherwise remain on her
1886	current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and
1887	primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.
1888	If her stress test
1889	is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for
1890	further evaluation.
1891	Thank you for referring this interesting patient.
1892	She was seen
1893	and examined with Dr. Voss.

1983	speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.
1984	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a
1985	history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
1986	She presents with
1987	episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls.
1988	She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.
1989	She
1990	also had dark stools over the past few weeks.
1991	She denies any
1992	associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any
1993	syncope, any nausea or vomiting.
1994	She does have a bruise on her
1995	chin.
1996	She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.
1997	No
1998	hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.
1999	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial
2000	fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
2001	hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.
2002	SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.
2003	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,
2004	otherwise negative.
2005	MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,
2006	and digoxin.
2007	ALLERGIES:  None.
2008	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory
2009	rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air.
2010	General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm
2011	ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left
2012	shoulder.
2013	Her pupils are reactive.
2014	Neck is supple.
2015	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.
2016	Cardiovascular:  Regular
2017	rate.
2018	Abdomen is soft.
2019	Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive
2020	melena per the resident.
2021	Skin is otherwise with bruises over the
2022	left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears
2023	healing.
2024	Extremities are with good range of motion.
2025	No focal
2026	tenderness.
2027	She is oriented x3.
2028	Mood and affect are normal.
2029	She is moving all extremities equally.
2030	LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal
2031	process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial
2032	abnormalities.
2033	Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit
2034	of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and
2035	platelets of 358.
2036	INR of 2.
2037	Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no
2038	blood.
2039	INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents
2040	with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent
2041	falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process
2042	such as a subdural or stroke.
2043	This has been going on for several
2044	weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past
2045	several weeks and profound anemia for which she required
2046	transfusion in the Emergency Department.
2047	We did order a CT of
2048	the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both
2049	given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.
2050	This
2051	does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.
2052	She is quite
2053	anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.
2054	I suspect this is the
2055	etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and
2056	concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could
2057	represent coronary insufficiency.
2058	She does not have an elevated
2059	troponin at present.
2060	She will need to be further monitored.
2061	was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her
2062	profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained.
2063	Clinically, feels better.
2064	I discussed with the patient's family
2065	because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____
2066	further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as
2067	physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical
2068	issues have been addressed.
2069	She will be admitted to the medical
2070	service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal
2071	bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in
2072	stable condition.

2246	   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
2247	This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI.
2248	This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
2249	Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.
2250	At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
2251	He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
2252	His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6.
2253	An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
2254	He never developed chest pain.
2255	An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
2256	The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
2257	The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
2258	The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
2259	The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
2260	Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result.
2261	His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
2262	An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis.
2263	He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
2264	It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
2265	He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
2266	The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
2267	He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope.
2268	He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain.
2269	He denies any calf pain.

2385	Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.
2386	She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.
2387	She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.
2388	On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.
2389	She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.
2390	"Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..	"
2391	"	EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance."
2392	In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.
2393	She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.
2394	She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.
2395	Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.
2396	She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.
2397	Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.
2398	She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.
2399	She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.
2400	ROS:   No F/C, + NS.

2409	On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head.
2410	No change in MS.
2411	In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds.
2412	On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted.
2413	Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91.
2414	On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning.
2415	On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night.
2416	This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC.
2417	ABG was performed which showed 7.48/52/50.
2418	After speaking to cardiology, decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU for intubation prior to cardiac cath this PM.
2419	A TEE will be performed while patient is intubated.
2420	Patient is currently NPO ready for cath this PM.

2543	Impression:
2544	Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ multiple medical problems including HOCM, s/p MVR and myomectomy as well as COPD who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past four days.
2545	Of note, the patient notes increasing DOE for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.
2546	Her progressive DOE may be related to CHF, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on EKG however, her acute decompensation may be related to COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.
2547	Plan: 
2548	SOB- Unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial
2549	--Treat COPD w/ Atrovent nebs, prednisone, O2, Levaquin
2550	--Patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so Albuterol was DC'ed
2551	--Follow urine output secondary to IV Lasix
2552	--Daily weights, strict Is and Os
2553	--Keep O2 sats 88-90% 
2554	EKG changes- Pt w/o known history of CAD however w/ and ST depressions on EKG that appear rate related
2555	--IV Lopressor to decrease rate
2556	--ASA
2557	--Cardiac monitor
2558	--Cardiac cath per Dr. Janssen with TEE
2559	MVR- On Coumadin
2560	--Follow INR
2561	Trigeminal neuralgia- Improving w/ pain control and Tegretol
2562	--Continue current management
2563	FEN- 
2564	--Encourage Pos
2565	--Replete lytes as needed
2566	Prophylaxis- Nexium, Coumadin

2581	HPI:
2582	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain.
2583	She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.
2584	It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
2585	It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.
2586	It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.
2587	It tapered off over about 20 minutes.
2588	She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.
2589	She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.
2590	She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.
2591	She has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).
2592	She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.
2593	She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.
2594	DCA ED Course:
2595	Initial EKG NSR without ischemic changes
2596	Initial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.
2597	CXR unremarkable.
2598	She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.
2599	She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.
2600	She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment.

2715	This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.
2716	Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.
2717	TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).
2718	DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).
2719	The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.
2720	Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.
2721	She is currently CP free.
2722	1.
2723	Chest pain
2724	-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now
2725	-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.
2726	Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.
2727	-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult
2728	-     TTE in AM
2729	-     Check amylase, lipase 
2730	-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM
2731	-     Smoking cessation consult
2732	2.
2733	Lupus-like condition
2734	-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM
2735	3.
2736	DM
2737	-     Check HbA1c
2738	-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS
2739	4.
2740	Renal
2741	-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate
2742	5.

2754	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.
2755	Chest pain.
2756	The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.
2757	He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.
2758	The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.
2759	He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.
2760	The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.
2761	He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.
2762	The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.
2763	It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.
2764	Left renal lesion.
2765	As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.
2766	The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.
2767	I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.
2768	Diabetes mellitus type 2.
2769	The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.
2770	Obstructive sleep apnea.

2772	Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.
2773	Elevated blood pressure.
2774	The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.
2775	Gastroesophageal reflux.
2776	The patient feels well on Zantac.

2794	The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.
2795	1.
2796	Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
2797	2.
2798	New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.

3071	Dear Dr. Barron:
3072	Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
3073	I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
3074	Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
3075	Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.
3076	It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.
3077	On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.
3078	She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
3079	I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
3080	Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.
3081	Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.
3082	Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.
3083	She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
3084	Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
3085	She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
3086	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.
3087	Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.
3088	She has no known drug allergies.
3089	Social History:  She is married and has three children.
3090	She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
3091	Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
3092	She has never used tobacco.
3093	Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
3094	There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
3095	Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
3096	Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
3097	All others are negative.
3098	On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.
3099	Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
3100	Her weight is 213 pounds.
3101	Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
3102	There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
3103	The carotid upstrokes are full.
3104	Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
3105	The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.
3106	The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
3107	The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.
3108	Her extremities show no edema.
3109	Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
3110	She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
3111	I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
3112	On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.
3113	She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
3114	She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
3115	There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
3116	She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
3117	In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.
3118	She did receive drug-eluting stents.
3119	The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
3120	What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.
3121	From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.
3122	She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.
3123	I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
3124	To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.
3125	We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
3126	In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.
3127	The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
3128	In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.
3129	Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.
3130	After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.
3131	However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.
3132	She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.
3133	The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.
3134	This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
3135	I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.
3136	Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
3137	If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

3152	Dear Dr. Barron:
3153	I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.
3154	As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.
3155	We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.
3156	We utilized the right radial artery for access.
3157	We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.
3158	This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.
3159	We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.
3160	The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.
3161	The final angiographic result was excellent.
3162	The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.
3163	She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.
3164	I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.
3165	If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.
3166	Sincerely,

3222	Patient is here for a follow-up.
3223	Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.
3224	Says
3225	that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people
3226	for transportation.
3227	Still has severe right shoulder pain.
3228	Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is
3229	worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.
3230	Reviewed x-rays, which were
3231	negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in
3232	the TMJ area.
3233	Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this
3234	shoulder pain.
3235	Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she
3236	could not take it with ibuprofen.
3237	I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in
3238	place of the ibuprofen and she understands.
3239	Is not willing to try Flexeril.
3240	Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult
3241	interactions with her children.
3242	Has not asked for more Valium.
3243	Has never been
3244	interested in counseling prior to today.
3245	Did not become tearful like she has in the
3246	past.
3247	Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.
3248	Prescription apparently was given to her
3249	last spring.
3250	Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.
3251	No clear to me what
3252	causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves
3253	her symptoms.
3254	I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain
3255	that is reproducible when she touches her chest.
3256	The patient seems to label her chest
3257	wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.
3258	PROBLEMS: As per LMR.
3259	MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.
3260	ALLERGIES: As per LMR.
3261	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD.

3277	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
3278	(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter
3279	     Mccarthy.
3280	Referral done.
3281	Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.
3282	(2)  Elevated blood pressure.
3283	Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated.
3284	At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.
3285	Think she may need
3286	     this at future visit.
3287	Will also refer back to her cardiologist.
3288	(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year.
3289	Several medications that patient appears
3290	     to be sensitive to side effects.
3291	At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting
3292	     profile.
3293	Positive checkup.
3294	Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.
3295	(4)  Leg cramps.
3296	Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25
3297	     years of leg cramps.
3298	Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction.

3303	(5)  History of sciatica.
3304	Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection
3305	     for her lower back pain, which resolved.
3306	Will simply follow with Vioxx, which
3307	     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.
3308	Also continue with
3309	     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and
3310	     chronic low back pain.
3311	Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks.
3312	ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell
3313	me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

3337	Has lost
3338	significant weight since hospitalization.
3339	Patient did agree that she has been watching
3340	what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight.
3341	Explained to her the
3342	importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.
3343	Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas.
3344	Says that the chest wall
3345	tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in
3346	the past.
3347	Would like some relief for this.
3348	Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful
3349	for the arthritic knee pain.

3362	     at next visit.
3363	Keep appointment with cardiologist.
3364	(2)  Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there
3365	     will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months.
3366	Told her
3367	     to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients.
3368	(3)  Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health.
3369	Not
3370	     suicidal.
3371	Encouraged patient to eat more regularly.
3372	(4)  Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.
3373	This visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient
3374	to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health.
3375	I was unsuccessful in
3376	convincing her to attend a Mental Health session.

3517	According to discharge summary of hospitalization in 7/97, urine was negative for eosinophils.
3518	A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.
3519	The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.
3520	She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms.
3521	I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.
3522	"P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of ""blockage"" means and about prognosis."
3523	I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).
3524	I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID.
3525	I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.
3526	Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.
3527	Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.
3528	Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead.
3529	She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8/27.
3530	Length of visit was 45 minutes.

3616	Studies
3617	EKG-NSR, dynamic t-wave changes anterior, ~1mm ST elevation worse than prior v4-v5
3618	CXR:  Vascular congestion.
3619	Impression and Plan:  58 year old man with PVD, likely CAD but no available ischemic work-up.
3620	Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load.
3621	There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations.
3622	No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand.
3623	Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place.
3624	As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis.
3625	Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR).
3626	Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation.
3627	Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues
3628	Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI.
3629	Follow markers.
3630	Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.
3631	Have request FMC records.
3632	Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath.
3633	Heparin, 
3634	Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP
3635	Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.

3925	(449) 515-0294
3926	REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.
3927	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
3928	1.
3929	The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in
3930	today having just had a stress test.
3931	Stress test showed that she
3932	was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds
3933	achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,
3934	stopped for fatigue.
3935	Immediately after exercise, she did have
3936	some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery.
3937	There were no EKG changes.
3938	The patient reports that she has been
3939	walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise
3940	level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had
3941	precipitated the hospitalization initially.
3942	She is looking into
3943	cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this.
3944	She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen.
3945	She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a
3946	healthy lifestyle.
3947	She has returned to work.
3948	She has follow up
3949	scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.
3950	2.
3951	Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her
3952	Glucophage 2000 mg a day.
3953	She monitors blood sugars but only in
3954	the morning.
3955	Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.
3956	However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically
3957	sweating and abdominal discomfort.
3958	She has never actually
3959	checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to
3960	occur at work.
3961	She has not had any fainting or dizziness.
3962	3.
3963	Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.
3964	4.
3965	Hypertension.
3966	At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose
3967	because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and
3968	currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.
3969	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,
3970	atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,
3971	Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,
3972	Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage
3973	500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.
3974	DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.
3975	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness
3976	of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
3977	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in
3978	good spirits.
3979	Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is
3980	70 and regular.
3981	Conjunctivae are clear.
3982	Sclerae are anicteric.
3983	Neck is supple.
3984	No neck vein distention.
3985	Chest is clear to
3986	percussion and auscultation.
3987	Heart: Regular rhythm.
3988	S1 and S2.
3989	No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.
3990	Extremities are without
3991	clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
3992	IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
3993	Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty
3994	with stenting.
3995	Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer.
3996	At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac
3997	rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.
3998	Diabetes, seems as though her control is 
3999	impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.
4000	We will
4001	discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.
4002	Elevated cholesterol.
4003	We will check on lipid status in four
4004	weeks' time.
4005	On current medications with target of LDL less than
4006	100.
4007	Blood pressure acceptable on current medical
4008	regimen.

4334	RADIOLOGY
4335	Chest CT:  4/11/96
4336	"	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to"
4337	"	suggest pulmonary embolism."
4338	There are several mediastinal lymph
4339	"	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size."
4340	However, in the
4341	"	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes"
4342	"	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis."
4343	These could be
4344	"	reactive or neoplastic."
4345	There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
4346	"	node."
4347	In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
4348	"	parenchymal nodule."
4349	This is best demonstrated on image 65.
4350	This
4351	"	could possibly represent a malignancy."
4352	Alternatively this could
4353	"	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node."
4354	This does not appear to
4355	"	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less"
4356	"	likely."
4357	Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
4358	"	right lung base."
4359	There is no pneumothorax.
4360	No significant
4361	"	pleural fluid is noted."
4362	There is no pericardial fluid.
4363	IMPRESSION:
4364	"	No pulmonary embolism or DVT."
4365	There are multiple mediastinal
4366	"	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe."
4367	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
4368	A follow-up chest CT may be further
4369	"	value."
4370	These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time
4371	"	of dictation."
4372	EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.
4373	A/P:
4374	Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.
4375	This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.
4376	I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.
4377	Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4378	CV:
4379	--Rate:  well controlled without medication.
4380	--Rhythm:  normal sinus
4381	--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.

4383	Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.
4384	Will obtain stress test in AM.
4385	PULM:  
4386	--plant PPD
4387	--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.
4388	--send ANCA
4389	--follow up CT for nodule
4390	--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing

4543	64 y.o.
4544	male with known CAD.
4545	He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
4546	At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
4547	He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
4548	He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
4549	He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA.
4550	His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
4551	He was referred for surgery.
4552	He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1.
4553	He now presents with recurrent chest burning.
4554	He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG.
4555	His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest.
4556	He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis.
4557	During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test.
4558	Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds.
4559	He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved.
4560	MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility.
4561	There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct.
4562	His ejection fraction is 46%.
4563	He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending.
4564	Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod.

4664	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
4665	Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.
4666	The Chief Complaint, History 
4667	of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
4668	Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
4669	by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
4670	the patient.
4671	Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
4672	with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
4673	essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.
4674	She 
4675	has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
4676	and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.
4677	Her 
4678	symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta.
4679	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
4680	noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
4681	systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
4682	border).
4683	LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
4684	changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.
4685	These were 
4686	previously noted in 10/78.
4687	THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
4688	and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
4689	morphine to relieve her pain.
4690	She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
4691	and was given some GI meds.
4692	She eventually became pain-free, 
4693	although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest.
4694	There are no electrocardiographic changes.
4695	IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
4696	pain suspicious for unstable angina.
4697	She has responded well to 
4698	aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
4699	evaluation.
4700	FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.
4701	DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission.
4702	Condition satisfactory.

5085	Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated
5086	   ejection fraction of 42%.
5087	There is severe anterior and anteroseptal
5088	   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.
5089	No left ventricular thombus is
5090	   detected.
5091	Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.
5092	Borderline left atrial enlargement.
5093	Normal right atrial size.

5290	with Labetalol.
5291	-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.
5292	-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity
5293	-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy

5308	Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.
5309	He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance.
5310	Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees.
5311	He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI.
5312	There was global hypokinesis.
5313	Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076).
5314	There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance.
5315	He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss.
5316	His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved.
5317	He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty.
5318	Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB.

5401	RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594
5402	Dear Dr. Vanpelt,
5403	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 
5404	recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
5405	I followed him in the hospital 
5406	when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.
5407	As you know, he is a 77 
5408	year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 
5409	hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 
5410	lower extremity bypasses in the past.
5411	He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 
5412	for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.
5413	His preoperative evaluation 
5414	included 
5415	a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 
5416	induced 
5417	hypokinesis in the inferior wall.
5418	Since this was a small area, it was felt 
5419	he 
5420	could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.
5421	He 
5422	underwent 
5423	left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 
5424	with 
5425	no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
5426	However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
5427	35 and a troponin of 19.5.
5428	As a result of his large troponin leak, he 
5429	underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 
5430	main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 
5431	artery, 
5432	100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 
5433	posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 
5434	PDA.
5435	Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 
5436	45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.
5437	Due to 
5438	his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 
5439	on 
5440	Apr 20, 2091.
5441	He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 
5442	graft to his obtuse marginal artery.
5443	He did not have a graft to his 
5444	posterior 
5445	descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary 
5446	Nicholas-Xaviar, Fred
5447	MR #65856594
5448	Page Two
5449	to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.
5450	Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 
5451	April 
5452	27, 2091.
5453	His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 
5454	Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 
5455	morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.
5456	and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.
5457	Since that time, he has done quite well.
5458	He has been progressing at 
5459	rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 
5460	per 
5461	day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 
5462	his house.
5463	He denies any chest pain with walking.
5464	He has no shortness of 
5465	breath or dyspnea on exertion.
5466	He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 
5467	long 
5468	time and this is unchanged.
5469	He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 
5470	claudication symptoms with walking at this time.
5471	He does complain of some 
5472	pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation.
5473	has 
5474	plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.
5475	On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 
5476	60.
5477	His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 
5478	without carotid bruits.
5479	His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 
5480	bilaterally.
5481	His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 
5482	rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.
5483	His 
5484	chest 
5485	incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well.
5486	has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 
5487	well.
5488	There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 
5489	does not appear to be cellulitic.
5490	His feet are warm.
5491	His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 
5492	in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 
5493	unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.
5494	In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 
5495	hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 
5496	disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 
5497	three 
5498	weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.
5499	will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 
5500	time.
5501	I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 
5502	and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.
5503	I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 
5504	his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.
5505	I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 
5506	regimen so I have changed his 
5507	Page Three
5508	Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d.
5509	and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o.
5510	q.d..

6060	Dear Dr. Truong:
6061	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.
6062	As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.
6063	Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.
6064	He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.
6065	Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.
6066	The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.
6067	Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.
6068	Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.
6069	He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.
6070	On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
6071	Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.
6072	His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.
6073	His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.
6074	His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.
6075	A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.
6076	A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.
6077	We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.
6078	We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.
6079	Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.
6080	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.
6081	Sincerely,

6090	The patient was seen in conjunction with Dr. Dickerson.
6091	I confirm
6092	that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

6097	hypertension and atypical chest pain who comes in with bilateral
6098	chest tightness since 11:00 a.m. and stated that she feels very
6099	lousy after taking her meds and daily has been getting chest
6100	tightness since her discharge recently in which she was admitted
6101	for weakness and hypertensive urgency.
6102	The patient stated that
6103	"she feels like a ""dead mouse."""
6104	She admits to some headache,
6105	dizziness and continued chest discomfort despite medications.

6139	hypertensive medication regime to include lisinopril, Toprol-XL,
6140	hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and apparently had a hard time
6141	with blood pressure control in hospital as well.
6142	I spoke with
6143	PCP coverage.
6144	Given the patient's symptoms and degree of change
6145	of medications, we would admit for further titration of
6146	hypertensive medications in addition, with cycle enzymes.

6346	ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     
6347	Chest xray: Clear
6348	Assessment & Plan
6349	83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting.
6350	Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features.
6351	However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain.
6352	Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s.
6353	However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion.
6354	It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.
6355	There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.
6356	Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
6357	Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
6358	Has completed MI r/o
6359	Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
6360	Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
6361	CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
6362	Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
6363	RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
6364	Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.
6365	Afebrile.
6366	Hemodynamically stable.
6367	U/A and chest xray negative
6368	Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
6369	Fen/Renal
6370	Replete Mg
6371	Proph: Lovenox, nexium

6379	   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.
6380	His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension.
6381	In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective.
6382	He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication.
6383	He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home.
6384	He did not require transfusion.
6385	The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred.
6386	Otherwise, his health is unchanged.
6387	He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.

6886	Sulfa - he thinks that he has had sulfa since the time he was labeled with an allergy to it but cannot recall details.
6887	Family History:  
6888	MGF had diabetes.
6889	Social History: 
6890	His wife died last week of Alzheimer's Disease, several months following a fall.
6891	He is a Financial Senior Manager.
6892	After the successful treatment of his lymphoma at about age 68, he went back to school to study sociology.
6893	Review of Systems: above

6913	"Impressions and Plan:	"
6914	"  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes."
6915	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.
6916	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89.
6917	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him.
6918	Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect).
6919	Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper.
6920	I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice.
6921	Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind.
6922	Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.
6923	Thanks.
6924	Will follow.

7037	"	Interval History:"
7038	   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.
7039	The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.
7040	He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.
7041	The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
7042	Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.
7043	The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.
7044	Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).
7045	The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
7046	An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.
7047	The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future.

7217	Depressed resting ABI in the RLE (0.70).
7218	Overall normal resting ABI in the LLE (1.00).
7219	Significant decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the RLE (0.24).
7220	Mild-to-moderate decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the LLE (0.50).
7221	Duplex U/S of the previously-stented distal L SFA revealed mild-to-moderately elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal portion of the stent (PSV 178 cm/sec), with normal velocities at the distal end of the stent (PSV 73 cm/sec).
7222	Duplex U/S also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal L PFA (PSV 306 cm/sec), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal-to-mid L SFA (PSV 191 cm/sec).
7223	Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.
7224	Assessment and plan:
7225	   ASSESSMENT:
7226	63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).
7227	In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.
7228	The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.
7229	PLAN:
7230	Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).
7231	Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.
7232	No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.
7233	Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.
7234	Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.
7235	Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.
7236	Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.
7237	Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.
7238	Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.
7239	Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.
7240	Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.
7241	Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.
7242	Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

7289	Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief.
7290	In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain.
7291	He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise.
7292	A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds.
7293	"He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because "" his legs gave out""."
7294	Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK.
7295	Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped.

7611	Dear Kenneth: 
7612	Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention.
7613	He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.
7614	At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.
7615	He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.
7616	He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.
7617	MEDICATIONS:
7618	1.
7619	Aspirin 325 mg daily.
7620	2.
7621	Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
7622	3.
7623	Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
7624	4.
7625	Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
7626	5.
7627	Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
7628	6.
7629	Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.
7630	INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:
7631	Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.
7632	Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.
7633	On examination, he is comfortable at rest.
7634	The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.
7635	The jugular venous pressure is 5.
7636	The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.
7637	The chest is clear.
7638	Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.
7639	The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.
7640	There is no peripheral pitting edema.
7641	The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.
7642	In summary, Mr. Lara has:
7643	History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.
7644	Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.
7645	Hypertension, not controlled.
7646	His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.
7647	We spoke about the options.
7648	As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.
7649	He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.
7650	To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.
7651	"A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly."
7652	Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.
7653	[Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms.
7654	Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines.
7655	He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.
7656	He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]
7657	Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.
7658	When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.
7659	A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.
7660	Mild mitral regurgitation.
7661	It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.
7662	With kind regards, sincerely yours,

7916	RE: HEATH, QUINTEN M
7917	      MRN: 8059475
7918	      DOB: 08/02/2095
7919	Dear Dr. Calhoun;
7920	We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
7921	As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck.
7922	We.
7923	started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
7924	In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels.
7925	We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
7926	He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.
7927	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
7928	1.
7929	Osteoporosis.
7930	2.
7931	Hypogonadism.
7932	3.
7933	History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
7934	4.
7935	Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7936	5.
7937	Hypertension.
7938	6.
7939	Diabetes type 2.
7940	7.
7941	Carotid artery disease, left.
7942	8.
7943	Hypercholesterolemia.
7944	9.
7945	Status post AAA repair in 2165.
7946	10.
7947	Coronary artery disease with status post stent.
7948	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.
7949	MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day.
7950	ALLERGIES: Tape.
7951	SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.
7952	Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds.
7953	Height 5 feet 4 inches.
7954	LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171.
7955	His hematocrit is 39.
7956	It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000.
7957	White count 4.8.
7958	In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer.
7959	The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
7960	I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
7961	He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid.
7962	We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
7963	Please let me know if you have any questions.
7964	Yours sincerely,

7978	HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75
7979	REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.
7980	DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173
7981	REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).
7982	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.
7983	He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.
7984	This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.
7985	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.
7986	He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.
7987	While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.
7988	He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.
7989	In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.
7990	On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
7991	On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.
7992	On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.
7993	Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.
7994	On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.
7995	He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69.
7996	Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).
7997	INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
7998	He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
7999	He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
8000	He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat.

8209	CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness
8210	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
8211	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
8212	He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).
8213	Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.
8214	He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).
8215	He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.
8216	He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.
8217	He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.
8218	To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.
8219	However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.
8220	On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.
8221	Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.
8222	EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).
8223	He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.
8224	For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.
8225	Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.
8226	(He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)
8227	CXR by report was clear.
8228	With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.
8229	Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.

8321	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
8322	Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.
8323	He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.
8324	He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.
8325	# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms
8326	- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion
8327	- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol
8328	- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs
8329	- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)
8330	- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures
8331	- Tele, replete lytes
8332	# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist
8333	- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids
8334	- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers
8335	- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 
8336	# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home.
8337	Relatively euvolemic.
8338	- Continue lasix QOD regimen
8339	- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy
8340	- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service
8341	# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house.

8434	REASON FOR ADMISSION
8435	Tailored therapy
8436	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
8437	Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures.
8438	Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.
8439	He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.
8440	He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.
8441	He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.
8442	Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.
8443	He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.
8444	He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.
8445	At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.
8446	He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.
8447	He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.
8448	He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.
8449	He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.
8450	Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.
8451	He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.
8452	He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.
8453	He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.
8454	He denies recent fevers or chills.
8455	He has no complaint of leg swelling.

8817	There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.
8818	Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.
8819	He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE.
8820	He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.
8821	NIHSS was zero.
8822	CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.
8823	There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.
8824	The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.
8825	He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.
8826	Plan: 
8827	- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
8828	- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
8829	- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
8830	- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
8831	- Neuro checks q4 hours
8832	- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
8833	- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
8834	- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
8835	- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
8836	- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
8837	- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.
8838	- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
8839	- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
8840	- Check blood cultures
8841	- Check chromogenic Factor X level
8842	- PT/OT evaluation
8843	- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130
8844	Thank you for this consult.

8859	Dear Dr. Ponce:
8860	I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.
8861	He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.
8862	Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.
8863	The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.
8864	He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.
8865	His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.
8866	Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.
8867	He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.
8868	He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.
8869	He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.
8870	Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.
8871	Please call if you have questions.

8884	Dear Dr. Berg:
8885	We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.
8886	As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.
8887	He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
8888	He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.
8889	He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.
8890	He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.
8891	The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
8892	The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.
8893	Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.
8894	He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.

8943	Dear Dr. Dill:
8944	DOB:  10/11/2082
8945	Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
8946	As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.
8947	Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.
8948	In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
8949	In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.
8950	He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
8951	On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.
8952	He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
8953	He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
8954	He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.
8955	Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.
8956	He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
8957	Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.
8958	A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
8959	Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.
8960	He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
8961	He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.
8962	He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.
8963	His weight has been stable.
8964	On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
8965	His weight has remained stable.
8966	He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
8967	Past Medical History:
8968	1.
8969	CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.
8970	He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.
8971	He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.
8972	He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
8973	A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.
8974	Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
8975	He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.
8976	An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.
8977	2.
8978	Hypertension.
8979	3.
8980	Dyslipidemia.
8981	4.
8982	Diabetes.
8983	5.
8984	Obstructive sleep apnea.
8985	6.
8986	COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.
8987	7.
8988	Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.
8989	8.?
8990	History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.
8991	9.
8992	Atrial fibrillation.
8993	10.
8994	Obesity.
8995	He has no known drug allergies.
8996	His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.
8997	His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.
8998	He was formally employed in buidling construction.
8999	He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.
9000	He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.
9001	His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.
9002	His father lived until the age of 88.
9003	His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.
9004	He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.
9005	Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.
9006	In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.
9007	Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.
9008	Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.
9009	Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.
9010	There is no wheezing.
9011	Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.
9012	There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.
9013	Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.
9014	Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
9015	There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
9016	Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.
9017	EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
9018	There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.
9019	There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.
9020	Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.
9021	He appears to be functional class III.
9022	He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.
9023	Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.
9024	We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
9025	We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
9026	However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.
9027	Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.
9028	We will leave this decision to them.
9029	Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.
9030	Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
9031	We will be in touch following the procedure.
9032	As always, feel free to call with any questions.
9033	Sincerely,

9047	"Reason for Visit	"
9048	Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.
9049	"Problems	  "
9050	"Congestive heart failure	      "
9051	He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.
9052	He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.
9053	He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.
9054	Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.
9055	Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.
9056	Moderate LV margin.
9057	Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).
9058	Dilated aortic loop.
9059	Normal RV size and function.
9060	Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.
9061	He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.
9062	He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.
9063	"coronary artery disease	      "
9064	After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.
9065	Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.
9066	10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.
9067	Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.
9068	The L main had no significant lesions.
9069	The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.
9070	He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.
9071	He was discharged the following day without complications.
9072	Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.
9073	"pacemaker	      "
9074	S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.
9075	Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.
9076	"S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      "
9077	12/76.
9078	10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT.
9079	CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD.
9080	AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST.
9081	FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT.
9082	TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.
9083	[04-Nov-2078]
9084	He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  
9085	"hypertension	      "
9086	BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.
9087	If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol
9088	"diabetes mellitus	      "
9089	He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
9090	He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.
9091	Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.
9092	"hypercholesterolemia	      "
9093	He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.
9094	We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.
9095	"nephropathy	      "
9096	S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
9097	As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.
9098	He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.
9099	[02-Jun-2087]
9100	Recheck BUN and creatinine today.
9101	"peripheral vascular disease	      "
9102	He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.
9103	"RECTAL FISTULA	      "
9104	SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE.
9105	SIG.
9106	HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA.
9107	HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.
9108	PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.
9109	CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.
9110	"OSTEOARTHRITIS	      "
9111	He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.
9112	"It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs."
9113	Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.
9114	Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.
9115	"Carotid stenosis	      "
9116	According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.
9117	Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.
9118	He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.
9119	"Review of Systems	"
9120	Small lesion on his R ear.
9121	Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.
9122	Nocturia X1.

9124	No neurologic symptoms.
9125	Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.
9126	Denies peripheral edema.
9127	No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.
9128	He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.
9129	No melena.

9281	    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
9282	Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
9283	    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past.
9284	9.
9285	Peripheral vascular disease.
9286	He continues to have bilateral
9287	    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
9288	    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
9289	    of claudication.
9290	10.
9291	Osteoarthritis.
9292	He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
9293	    and is now doing quite well.
9294	Notably, he would require
9295	    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.
9296	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
9297	abdominal pain.
9298	He continues to have a rectal fistula.
9299	Last
9300	year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
9301	sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
9302	presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
9303	bleeds.
9304	He has had no recent edema in his legs.
9305	His left knee is
9306	doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
9307	muscles.
9308	He has nocturia one time per night.
9309	He has stable
9310	impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased
9311	ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial
9312	erection.
9313	Generalized decreased energy level.
9314	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular.
9315	Weight: 181.
9316	General: amazingly well appearing.
9317	Skin: no

9396	He had an episode of shortness of breath leading
9397	to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.
9398	Unfortunately, I
9399	do not have records but there was some question of whether this
9400	was related to asthma, allergies or CHF.

9456	West Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling
9457	and pain.
9458	He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
9459	Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
9460	and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.

9518	George, Rickey
9519	MRN: 1131414
9520	06/10/92
9521	REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.
9522	PROBLEMS:
9523	1.
9524	Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.
9525	Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.
9526	He was managed by multiple
9527	services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.
9528	His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
9529	with a prolonged course of fluconazole.
9530	Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
9531	effectively with carvedilol.
9532	Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
9533	hospitalization.
9534	He never had any sustained VT or VF.
9535	He was subsequently discharged home
9536	with a Life vest defibrillator.
9537	He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.
9538	He currently has no AICD or
9539	pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
9540	for his arrhythmia issues.
9541	He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.
9542	Currently
9543	his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
9544	regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.
9545	2.
9546	CHF.
9547	Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
9548	directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him.
9549	He had one episode of CHF, which
9550	was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.
9551	At the
9552	present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
9553	night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
9554	He does
9555	continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
9556	3.
9557	Coronary artery disease.
9558	Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
9559	angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
9560	4.
9561	Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.
9562	His left TKR also required removal
9563	due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.
9564	He has had no
9565	recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
9566	issues.
9567	He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
9568	down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.
9569	5.
9570	Diabetes mellitus.
9571	Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
9572	twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
9573	has been gradually decreased.
9574	He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
9575	and he reports that his fasting
9576	sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
9577	range.
9578	He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.
9579	We will check
9580	his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
9581	Page 2
9582	6.
9583	Hyperlipidemia.
9584	He continues on Lipitor.
9585	We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
9586	CPK.
9587	7.
9588	Diabetic nephropathy.
9589	He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
9590	to re-establish baseline.
9591	8.
9592	Status post CVA.
9593	Known moderate right carotid stenosis.
9594	Minimal residual dysarthria
9595	and right-sided weakness.
9596	Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.
9597	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.
9598	Was unable to get sufficient blood
9599	pressure by cuff.
9600	Pulse 60, mostly irregular.
9601	General, thin, but no distress.
9602	Lungs, clear to
9603	auscultation and percussion.
9604	Cor, distant heart sounds.
9605	No S3 appreciated.
9606	Old pacer/AICD site.
9607	No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.
9608	Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.
9609	DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.
9610	ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
9611	both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
9612	At this time, he was
9613	quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
9614	He did deny
9615	abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
9616	At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
9617	send in to me by mail.
9618	I have also sent off a CBC today.
9619	I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
9620	next visit.
9621	If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
9622	more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
9623	aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

9635	  Rickey George
9636	  MR#1131414
9637	  October 05, 2092
9638	  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.
9639	PROBLEMS:
9640	  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe.
9641	Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.
9642	Treated by Dr. Randall.
9643	Underwent extensive
9644	  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
9645	  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
9646	  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
9647	  knee popliteal bypass graft.
9648	With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
9649	  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
9650	He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
9651	  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
9652	  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.
9653	Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
9654	  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
9655	  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
9656	  hospital discharge 9/9.
9657	Will recheck renal function today.
9658	Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
9659	  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.
9660	His blood sugars are now in the normal
9661	  range on no oral agents or insulin.
9662	Will need to monitor closely through rehab.
9663	CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d.
9664	of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.
9665	At the time of
9666	  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d.
9667	and not surprisingly he developed quite
9668	  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.
9669	He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
9670	  up to 60 b.i.d.
9671	but he still has significant edema.
9672	Will go back to 80 b.i.d.
9673	with close
9674	  monitoring.
9675	Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.
9676	Will hold lisinopril
9677	  for now.
9678	Close VNA follow up.
9679	COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.
9680	Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.
9681	Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
9682	  and surgery with blood loss.
9683	His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
9684	  and he was being started on Epogen.
9685	Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
9686	  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a
9687	  Page 2
9688	  week.
9689	For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.
9690	Given his
9691	  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.
9692	Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
9693	  anginal symptoms.
9694	Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.
9695	Generally weak.
9696	Home services
9697	  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
9698	  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.
9699	Social history: wife very involved with his care.
9700	Physical exam: BP 98/60.
9701	Pulse 64.
9702	Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop.
9703	No rub.
9704	Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.
9705	Multiple well healed surgical scars.
9706	Extremities: incisions in the groin.
9707	No erythema.
9708	Right groin several cm question cystic
9709	  structure beneath the incision.
9710	Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.
9711	2-3+ edema in the
9712	  extremities bilaterally.
9713	Dry gangrene left second toe.
9714	Disposition: 1.
9715	Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d.
9716	phone follow up within several days.
9717	2.
9718	Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.
9719	3.
9720	Continue Percocet for toe pain.
9721	4.
9722	Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.
9723	5.
9724	Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.
9725	In the meantime, will
9726	  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.
9727	6.
9728	Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o.
9729	q.d.
9730	Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
9731	  about end of life issues.
9732	Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
9733	  other than his single toe at this point.
9734	"He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a"
9735	  BKA.
9736	He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
9737	  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

9877	"	Interval History:"
9878	   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
9879	Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
9880	Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
9881	Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.
9882	The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
9883	A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
9884	There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
9885	A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
9886	Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
9887	RV function was normal.
9888	He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
9889	He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
9890	He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted.
9891	He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.
9892	The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
9893	LV EF 63%.
9894	He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
9895	His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.
9896	A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
9897	The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.
9898	LV EF 68%.
9899	He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
9900	He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
9901	He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.
9902	He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
9903	His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
9904	Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
9905	This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
9906	Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
9907	He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e.
9908	muscolskeletal in nature).
9909	He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.
9910	He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.
9911	He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
9912	No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
9913	He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
9914	He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
9915	He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
9916	Past medical history:
9917	   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
9918	Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
9919	2) Hypertension
9920	3) Hyperlipideimia
9921	4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI
9922	5) Ankylosing spondylitis

9943	"	EKG:"
9944	   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.
9945	Assessment and plan:
9946	   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.
9947	1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.
9948	Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
9949	Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point.
9950	He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
9951	His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
9952	The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
9953	He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.
9954	His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
9955	However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.
9956	I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.
9957	2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.
9958	His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
9959	Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.
9960	He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
9961	flushing).
9962	He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
9963	After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.
9964	He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
9965	He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
9966	3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
9967	He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

10067	Chandler, Jessica
10068	MRN #748-80-38-0
10069	May 05, 2069
10070	Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
10071	artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
10072	Since the surgery she has done
10073	quite well.
10074	She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
10075	4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
10076	and also education on dietary modification.
10077	During her hospital
10078	course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
10079	ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
10080	wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
10081	She was
10082	started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
10083	She
10084	also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
10085	Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
10086	She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
10087	renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
10088	Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
10089	diuretics.
10090	Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
10091	with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
10092	She is
10093	not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
10094	of breath.
10095	She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
10096	Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
10097	Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
10098	Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
10099	q.d.,
10100	lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o.
10101	daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o.
10102	Kayexalate 15 p.o.
10103	q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
10104	q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o.
10105	q. day, Nephrocaps
10106	one tablet p.o.
10107	q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
10108	subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o.
10109	q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o.
10110	q. day and
10111	CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
10112	Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
10113	pounds.
10114	Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
10115	150/100, pulse is 80.
10116	Her skin is without any rashes or
10117	ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.
10118	Heart regular rhythm,
10119	distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
10120	Her lungs are clear,
10121	there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
10122	healed.
10123	Her extremities are without any edema.
10124	Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
10125	Diagnosis:
10126	1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
10127	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
10128	Page 2 
10129	3)   Diabetes mellitus.
10130	4)   Anemia of chronic disease.
10131	5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.
10132	6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
10133	7)   Hypertension.
10134	8)   Morbid obesity.
10135	Plan:
10136	1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
10137	She is clinically
10138	     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
10139	     or angina.
10140	Her ejection fraction significantly improved
10141	     postoperatively.
10142	I am concerned about a relatively high blood
10143	     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
10144	     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
10145	I will
10146	     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
10147	     of her potassium.
10148	2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
10149	Again we'll check regular labs
10150	     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
10151	Stable.
10152	Her blood pressure have been
10153	     under fairly good control.
10154	She has also lost a significant
10155	     amount of weight over 20 pounds.
10156	Her current weight is 326
10157	     pounds.
10158	We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
10159	We'll also recheck her blood count
10160	     and follow-up.
10161	The patient is using her CPAP
10162	     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
10163	6)   Hyperkalemia.
10164	She will continue with the Kayexalate as
10165	     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
10166	     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
10167	7)   Morbid obesity.
10168	She is making good progress with her weight
10169	     loss.
10170	She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
10171	     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
10172	     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
10173	     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica
10174	Page 3 
10175	She will follow-up with me in one month's time.

10195	07/28/70
10196	Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
10197	shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.
10198	I had added
10199	Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.
10200	However,
10201	her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
10202	increase in her BUN and creatinine.
10203	Her BUN is in the 80's, and
10204	her creatinine is about 3.4.
10205	She states her breathing has been
10206	excellent, however.
10207	She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
10208	exertion.
10209	She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
10210	having any kind of dry cough.
10211	Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
10212	q.day, Paxil 20 p.o.
10213	q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o.
10214	q.day, Prilosec 20 mg

10219	Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o.
10220	q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
10221	in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
10222	q.day.
10223	Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
10224	Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
10225	acute distress.
10226	Her weight is 330 pounds.
10227	This is down over 20
10228	pounds over the past month.
10229	Her blood pressure is 122/80.
10230	Her
10231	pulse is 80.
10232	Her lungs are clear.
10233	Her heart reveals distant heart
10234	sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.
10235	Her extremities are notable
10236	for the absence of lower extremity edema.
10237	Her abdomen is also
10238	noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
10239	past.
10240	Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
10241	continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
10242	the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.
10243	There is beefy red
10244	granulation tissue surrounding this.

10263	Plan:
10264	She is doing much better on
10265	higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
10266	since her last visit here about a month ago.
10267	At this point in
10268	time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
10269	given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
10270	to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
10271	and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
10272	and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
10273	telephone conversation in four days.
10274	Should she have an increase
10275	in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
10276	Stable
10277	without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.
10278	Continue current
10279	medication.
10280	She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.
10281	I strongly wanted her to go
10282	on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
10283	her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.
10284	She is
10285	planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.
10286	I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
10287	strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.
10288	Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.
10289	Stable.
10290	regimen.
10291	The plan as above is to
10292	stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days.
10293	Diabetic foot ulcer.
10294	I also gave her a duoderm dressing
10295	to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
10296	podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
10297	appropriate treatment.

10376	Follow Up - post hospitalization visit
10377	He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.
10378	On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.
10379	As a result he did not exercise that day.
10380	The symptoms improved spontaneously.
10381	On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.
10382	Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.
10383	Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.
10384	He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.
10385	There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.
10386	He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.
10387	"When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion."
10388	He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.
10389	He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.
10390	Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.
10391	He is feeling great.
10392	He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.
10393	He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.
10394	He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.
10395	He has had no groin hematoma or other complications.

10553	HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
10554	treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.
10555	He was seen in MHC 
10556	clinic prior to that.
10557	His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
10558	number is 872-9985.
10559	Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
10560	that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
10561	not seen a physician in the past year.
10562	His medical problems include:
10563	1.
10564	Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.
10565	It is unclear 
10566	     which vessels were plastied.
10567	2.
10568	Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
10569	     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.
10570	However, he has not taken any 
10571	     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well.
10572	3.
10573	Anxiety.
10574	4.
10575	Condyloma last fall.
10576	Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.
10577	; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
10578	q.h.s.
10579	prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.
10580	Patient also had 
10581	nitroglycerin tablets at home.
10582	Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
10583	t.i.d.
10584	; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.
10585	He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
10586	Social history:  He is currently not working.
10587	He has been unemployed for 
10588	a month and a half.
10589	He used to be a social worker which did not 
10590	involve any heavy lifting.
10591	He did community services managment.
10592	He 
10593	lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.
10594	Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
10595	chest pains over the last 10 years.
10596	However, he does say that his last 
10597	chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.
10598	When asked where the 
10599	pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
10600	pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
10601	angioplasty.
10602	He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
10603	relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.
10604	At the 
10605	time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.
10606	He has no 
10607	history of exertional angina over the last several years.
10608	However, this 
10609	complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.
10610	currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
10611	exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
10612	On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
10613	apparent distress.
10614	Temperature was afebrile.
10615	Heart rate was 68 and 
10616	regular.
10617	Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
10618	position.
10619	HEENT was within normal limits.
10620	Lungs were clear bilaterally.
10621	Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
10622	Abdomen was benign.
10623	Extremities were without edema or lesions.

10626	Assessment and Plan:
10627	Cardiovascular.
10628	Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
10629	     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
10630	     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.
10631	Given that he is on 
10632	     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
10633	     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d.
10634	in an attempt to 
10635	     control his blood pressure and heart rate.
10636	I also encouraged him to 
10637	     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
10638	     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.
10639	The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
10640	     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.
10641	After he 
10642	     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
10643	     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
10644	     evidence of ischemia at this time.
10645	If he does, we will recommend a 
10646	     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
10647	     causing syms of rest angina.
10648	The case was discussed with any 
10649	     cardiacs that are on call.
10650	Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
10651	     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
10652	     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
10653	     has at a level of 336.
10654	He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
10655	     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.
10656	I 
10657	     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
10658	     diet and explained which food contain those products.
10659	I will also 
10660	     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
10661	     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.
10662	We will start him 
10663	     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d.
10664	later this week.
10665	Daily anxiety.
10666	Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
10667	     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
10668	     Ativan.
10669	History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.
10670	Patient 
10671	     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
10672	     his next visit.
10673	If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
10674	     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

11010	RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
11011	SFC#:  553-15-48 
11012	Dear Dr. Kirk:  
11013	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.
11014	He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.
11015	The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
11016	An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
11017	The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.
11018	The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.
11019	Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
11020	There was no critical carotid stenosis.
11021	He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.
11022	He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
11023	His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.
11024	It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.
11025	He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
11026	He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.
11027	Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.
11028	He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
11029	He has no symptoms of aphasia.
11030	He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.
11031	I would agree with him.
11032	He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.
11033	Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.
11034	He has not had any problems with spasms.
11035	His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
11036	He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.
11037	He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.
11038	His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
11039	He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
11040	He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
11041	He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
11042	His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.
11043	b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o.
11044	q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o.
11045	q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o.
11046	q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o.
11047	b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.
11048	He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.
11049	He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
11050	I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.
11051	He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
11052	The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
11053	The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
11054	There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.
11055	On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
11056	His blood pressure was 150/90.
11057	His language was intact.
11058	His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.
11059	He was alert and oriented.
11060	His conversation was appropriate.
11061	The visual fields were full.
11062	The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.
11063	Facial sensation was normal.
11064	There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
11065	The tongue and palate were midline.
11066	The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
11067	There was atrophy of the left biceps.
11068	There was full range of motion of the joints.
11069	The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.
11070	The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
11071	His right side was 5/5.
11072	He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
11073	His right toe was downgoing.
11074	Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
11075	I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
11076	Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
11077	He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.
11078	Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.
11079	He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
11080	I hope that this will be the case.
11081	Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.
11082	I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
11083	His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
11084	I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.
11085	I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
11086	The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
11087	I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
11088	However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.
11089	He should continue on an aspirin a day.
11090	He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
11091	I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.
11092	We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
11093	This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
11094	After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.
11095	I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
11096	I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.
11097	The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.
11098	Sincerely,

11776	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
11777	56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest
11778	#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause.
11779	The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.
11780	Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).
11781	-Telemetry
11782	-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB
11783	-If positive will start heparin gtt
11784	-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes
11785	-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM
11786	-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix
11787	-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)
11788	#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs.
11789	The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease.
11790	Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP.
11791	Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct.
11792	-f/u smear
11793	-monitor CBC
11794	#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival
11795	-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)
11796	#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose
11797	-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123
11798	-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM
11799	#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7
11800	-FSBG AC+HS
11801	-RISS AC
11802	#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.
11803	-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70
11804	-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine
11805	-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection
11806	#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response
11807	-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)
11808	#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs
11809	-Urine tox
11810	-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings
11811	-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation
11812	-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624
11813	-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital
11814	-Continue methadone while in house
11815	#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin
11816	-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)
11817	#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
11818	#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax
11819	#) Dispo: likely home pending cardiac w/u

11839	On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.
11840	His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.
11841	On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ?
11842	aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.
11843	He received ASA and SLTNG
11844	Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).

11850	(2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.
11851	Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia.
11852	Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.
11853	Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather.
11854	Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.
11855	On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.
11856	He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.
11857	SDU Course:
11858	For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.

11916	He also had transient reocclusion during procedure.
11917	TIMI II flow after IC adenosine.
11918	IABP and temp wire (for profound bradycardia) were placed during procedure.
11919	V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK, EF approximately 40%.
11920	His peak CK were 1491.
11921	Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event, other causes of low EF were investigated.
11922	His serum Fe was slightly low, TSH was normal, SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma.
11923	Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 210, Trig 59, HDL 45, LDL 153.
11924	HgbA1c was 6.3.
11925	Because of reocclusion during cath, hypercoag workup was sent and was negative (including lupus anticoagulant, hypercoag panel, HIT).
11926	He continued to have some chest pain post-cath with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization.
11927	He has now been persistently pain-free.
11928	His IABP was d/ced 7/12.

11981	"Re:	Russell Urban	"
11982	"WRH#	4722064	"
11983	Dear Dr. Ussery:
11984	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
11985	As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.
11986	He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
11987	By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.
11988	He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.
11989	That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.
11990	He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
11991	The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.
11992	Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
11993	He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
11994	This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.
11995	A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
11996	He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
11997	A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093.
11998	This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
11999	His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
12000	Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern.
12001	He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
12002	Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.
12003	He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
12004	He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.
12005	He has felt very well.
12006	He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.
12007	His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
12008	Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.
12009	He was evaluated and released.
12010	He never had any further testing.
12011	He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.
12012	Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.
12013	His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.
12014	He has no known drug allergies.
12015	Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.
12016	He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
12017	He has been working in Borders.
12018	He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.
12019	He has no children.
12020	He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.
12021	He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
12022	He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
12023	On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.
12024	His heart rate is 60 and regular.
12025	In general, he is in no apparent distress.
12026	His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
12027	His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.
12028	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
12029	He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
12030	His abdomen is benign.
12031	His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
12032	On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
12033	His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.
12034	His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
12035	The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
12036	His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
12037	His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.
12038	His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
12039	He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.
12040	Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
12041	He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.
12042	His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
12043	His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
12044	There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
12045	His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
12046	In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.
12047	Also, his systolic function has improved over time.
12048	I think there are two processes going on.
12049	One is coronary artery disease.
12050	Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.
12051	The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
12052	Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.
12053	He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.
12054	I suspect that this is myocarditis.
12055	Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.
12056	It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
12057	From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.
12058	He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.
12059	For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.
12060	His LDL goal will be less than 100.
12061	He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.
12062	His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
12063	I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
12064	I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
12065	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.
12066	The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.

12083	Dear Dr. Ussery:
12084	I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.
12085	Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.
12086	He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.
12087	Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.
12088	He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.
12089	He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.
12090	He has stopped smoking.
12091	There have been no difficulties with his medications.
12092	On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.
12093	Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.
12094	He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.
12095	His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.
12096	Medications:
12097	Aspirin 325 mg daily
12098	Plavix 75 mg daily 
12099	Lipitor 40 mg daily
12100	lisinopril 10 mg daily
12101	Coreg 6.25 mg daily.
12102	Physical examination:
12103	He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.
12104	His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.
12105	His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.
12106	His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
12107	His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
12108	He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.
12109	His abdomen is soft.
12110	It is neither tender nor distended.
12111	He has normal bowel sounds.
12112	His extremities are warm and well perfused.
12113	He has no edema.
12114	Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.
12115	Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.
12116	He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.
12117	Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.
12118	The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.
12119	There is likely a component of left heart failure.
12120	In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.
12121	He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.
12122	This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.
12123	Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.
12124	The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.
12125	To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.
12126	If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.
12127	I will see him again in six months' time.
12128	Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.
12129	Regards,

12141	"History of Present Illness	"
12142	     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93.
12143	He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward.
12144	Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.
12145	He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia.
12146	EF at that time was 51%.
12147	He has done reasonably well since then.
12148	In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion.
12149	He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95.
12150	EKG was positive for ischemia.
12151	Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia.
12152	His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.
12153	Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA.
12154	Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions.
12155	His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results.
12156	He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

12345	I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage.
12346	P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while.
12347	he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes.
12348	I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week.

12476	Dear Cecilia;
12477	I had the pleasure of seeing Lonnie in the Clinic today.
12478	As you
12479	know, he is a 72-year-old gentleman recently diagnosed with
12480	myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome.
12481	He has required
12482	blood cell transfusions for this.
12483	He is currently receiving
12484	Hydrea for this.
12485	He also has coronary disease, for which he had
12486	stents placed in his LAD and OM in 07/65.
12487	This has been stable.
12488	He also had some congestive heart failure, for which he has no
12489	further symptoms at this time.
12490	His weight is only up 1-2 pounds
12491	but has remained stable with an increased appetite.
12492	Medications: Include atenolol 25 mg p.o.
12493	q.d., aspirin 325 mg
12494	q.d., vitamin B12 injections q. monthly, metformin 850 mg t.i.d.,
12495	lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
12496	q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.
12497	q.d.
12498	Physical Examination: Blood pressure: 102/60.
12499	Heart rate: 60
12500	beats/min.
12501	Neck examination reveals no jugular venous distention 
12502	Chest examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
12503	Cardiac
12504	examination reveals normal S1, physiologically split S2, no
12505	evidence of a murmurs, rubs or gallops at this time.
12506	He has no
12507	peripheral edema or clubbing.
12508	EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST or T wave abnormalities.
12509	Compared to his prior EKG, T wave changes in the anterior leads
12510	are improved.
12511	Wagner, Lonnie
12512	MR #097-87-37-2               -2-                 September 29, 2065 
12513	Impression: Mr. Wagner is doing very well from an ischemic and
12514	heart failure perspective.
12515	He remains on a good regimen of
12516	afterload reduction and anti-ischemic agents.
12517	At this time, I do
12518	not recommend any changes in his cardiac medications.
12519	The patient was seen in consultation with Dr. Jacqueline Lam.

12629	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
12630	Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.
12631	He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
12632	"While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure""."
12633	He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes.
12634	There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.
12635	"An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG."
12636	Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized.
12637	"On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels."
12638	Stent placement was not attempted.
12639	His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward.
12640	A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 
12641	ASA 81 mg
12642	Plavix 75 mg po qd
12643	Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
12644	Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
12645	Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
12646	Lipitor 40 mg po qd
12647	A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
12648	Metformin 1000 mg po bid
12649	Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital.
12650	He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes.
12651	It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:
12652	Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.
12653	Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.
12654	No chest pain was    reported.
12655	Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.
12656	The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.
12657	See exercise report for full ECG details.
12658	Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.
12659	There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.
12660	Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
12661	Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%.
12662	No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.
12663	Trace mitral regurgitation.4.
12664	Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.
12665	All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
12666	Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.
12667	At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.
12668	Glycemic control ahs been variable.
12669	Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.
12670	Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.

12739	Dear Gray:
12740	I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
12741	As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.
12742	I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
12743	I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
12744	The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
12745	At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
12746	He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
12747	He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal).
12748	An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
12749	An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
12750	Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic.
12751	Since then, he has had no further episodes.
12752	ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope.
12753	He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
12754	PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).
12755	Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening.
12756	This is an Equadorian formulation.
12757	SHx:
12758	He does not drink, nor smoke.
12759	FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
12760	Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
12761	On exam, he looks well.
12762	His heart rate is in the 64.
12763	His blood pressure was 115/70.
12764	His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
12765	His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
12766	His chest was clear to auscultation.
12767	His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
12768	His abdomen was soft.
12769	Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
12770	Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
12771	In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease.
12772	He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
12773	I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.
12774	With warm regards,  
12775	Sincerely yours,

12781	Dear Dr. Jean:
12782	Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .
12783	He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.
12784	Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.
12785	On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal.
12786	The  incision is healing very nicely.
12787	Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.
12788	EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.
12789	His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker.
12790	Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.
12791	Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.
12792	He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.
12793	He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.
12794	Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.
12795	I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .
12796	I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up.
12797	I am releasing  him to your care.
12798	We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.
12799	With warm regards,

13070	Record date: 2129-05-10
13071	Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.
13072	Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.
13073	Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
13074	Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.
13075	When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.
13076	Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.
13077	Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.
13078	Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
13079	Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.
13080	so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
13081	We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.
13082	"He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
13083	OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.
13084	Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.
13085	DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.
13086	Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.
13087	UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.
13088	Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.
13089	Optho and podiatry current.
13090	Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.

13095	well controlled.
13096	Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.
13097	Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.
13098	Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.
13099	Insomnia : since service.
13100	NTI helped a little in past, not after a while.
13101	CBT might help if successful.
13102	Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.
13103	Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.
13104	Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

13111	"			Reason for visit:"
13112	   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
13113	Interval History:
13114	   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
13115	A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
13116	An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
13117	The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion.
13118	HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA.
13119	1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
13120	His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.
13121	An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
13122	Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
13123	He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
13124	(BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2.
13125	An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
13126	Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters.
13127	He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
13128	In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief.
13129	He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
13130	An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
13131	He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done.
13132	It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.
13133	Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held.
13134	He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
13135	He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
13136	Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.
13137	(2 liters NP)
13138	Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent.
13139	Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

13250	PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
13251	MRN:  8099832
13252	ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
13253	PCP:  unknown
13254	CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital
13255	HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.
13256	At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.
13257	As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.
13258	Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.
13259	Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.
13260	During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.
13261	At present, pt.
13262	c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.
13263	She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.
13264	Hospital Course: 
13265	MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt.
13266	was started on IV vancomycin.
13267	The bacteremic source remains unclear.
13268	TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.
13269	A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.
13270	Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.
13271	A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
13272	Back pain: Pt.
13273	c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.
13274	Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.
13275	An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.
13276	The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.
13277	No epidural extension was noted.
13278	There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.
13279	Pt.
13280	received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.
13281	As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.
13282	A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.
13283	A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.
13284	A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.
13285	Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.
13286	Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.
13287	A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.
13288	The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.
13289	An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.
13290	A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.
13291	Renal failure:  Pt.
13292	developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.
13293	Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.
13294	Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.
13295	Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.
13296	She was started on procrit by hematology.
13297	She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
13298	TIA:  Pt.
13299	has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.
13300	An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.
13301	This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.
13302	A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.
13303	No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.
13304	HTN: Pt.
13305	required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.
13306	MEDICAL HISTORY
13307	Recurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalization
13308	Seizure disorder: first sz in 2090s with unresponsive, staring, mouth movements; often occurred in clusters once a year, last sz prior to admission.

13691	CC: emesis, light-headedness 
13692	HPI: 85 y/o with CAD and active ischemia on 6/87 stress test (medically managed) who was feeling well until last night.
13693	During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.
13694	In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.
13695	He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.
13696	He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.
13697	The arm pain is not exertional.
13698	After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.
13699	A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.
13700	After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.
13701	He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.
13702	He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.
13703	In the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.

13705	He was noted to be in A fib.
13706	Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).
13707	NG lavage was not performed in the ED.
13708	However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3.
13709	HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain.
13710	He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.

14274	Re:  William Potts
14275	     MR#  109-16-75-8
14276	Dear Matt:
14277	I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.
14278	As you
14279	know, he recently had a complicated hospital course.
14280	He underwent
14281	cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD
14282	including 70% and 90% stenoses.
14283	The first marginal branch had a
14284	60% ostial stenosis.
14285	The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
14286	stenoses, respectively.
14287	The PDA had a 70% narrowing.
14288	Given his
14289	very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to
14290	proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
14291	the obtuse marginal.
14292	It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,
14293	and not worth going after at this time.
14294	The RCA was successfully
14295	stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left
14296	ventricular branch.
14297	By the end of the procedure, flow had been
14298	restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,
14299	but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
14300	infarction.
14301	Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
14302	branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.
14303	Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure.
14304	The second
14305	exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.
14306	He exercised for
14307	nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest
14308	pain.
14309	He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
14310	of 121.
14311	MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
14312	infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.
14313	There was
14314	moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
14315	territory of the RCA.
14316	Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts
14317	undergo bypass surgery.
14318	Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,
14319	Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d.
14320	He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
14321	Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
14322	recently.
14323	His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
14324	William Potts
14325	MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070
14326	from a hip fracture.
14327	He is having difficulty arranging the
14328	appropriate insurance to cover her medications.
14329	Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.
14330	This
14331	occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest
14332	and/or 1 nitroglycerin.
14333	He has decreased his work level
14334	considerably, and is relatively sedentary.
14335	On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.
14336	He had
14337	a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.
14338	His weight
14339	was 203 pounds.
14340	Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion.
14341	Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI
14342	with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
14343	Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
14344	His abdomen is soft,
14345	nontender.
14346	There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux.
14347	Extremities are without edema.
14348	Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61.
14349	Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees.
14350	There are
14351	flipped T-waves in III and AVF.
14352	I did not have an old
14353	electrocardiogram here for comparison.
14354	Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with
14355	mild exertion.
14356	He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
14357	surgery.
14358	He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
14359	by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this.
14360	There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
14361	return to work as an actor.
14362	Given Mr. Potts's current
14363	feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon
14364	as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
14365	It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
14366	year-old mother at home, along with his wife.
14367	His mother currently
14368	uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot
14369	exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
14370	the house.
14371	He understands this, and if his chest pain should
14372	become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately
14373	call me.
14374	If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two
14375	weeks at NDNH.
14376	With best regards.
14377	Sincerely,

14597	MRN#:  8913196
14598	Date of Consult:  7/26/78
14599	Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg
14600	HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.
14601	He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.
14602	He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot.
14603	There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78.
14604	He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well.
14605	The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.
14606	No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.
14607	During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.
14608	The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.
14609	The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.

14672	General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
14673	Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.
14674	On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.
14675	It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.
14676	The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.
14677	The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.
14678	No odor.
14679	There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.
14680	Distal pulses palpable.
14681	Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.
14682	There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.
14683	The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.
14684	Relevant Laboratory Values:
14685	Pending
14686	Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.
14687	This may be amenable to local flap coverage.
14688	Recommendations: 
14689	-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
14690	-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
14691	-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
14692	-Continue daily dressing changes for now.

14700	Medical Record: 8913196
14701	Attending:  Snyder
14702	History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.
14703	Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.
14704	The wound was overlying the BPG.
14705	He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.
14706	He has been followed in clinic.
14707	Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.
14708	In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
14709	The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.
14710	He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.
14711	His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
14712	No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
14713	Past Medical History:
14714	CAD, Htn, CRI (Cr 1.8 at baseline), DM, PVD, Carotid Stenosis s/p R CEA 3/73, CHF, AF, Nephrolithiasis, Spinal Stenosis

15351	65 y/o F with colon cancer (known, surgery/GI refuse to proceduralize), ESRD on HD (M/W/F), CVA c/b severe residual speech/cognitive deficits, HTN, recurrent GIB who presents with hypotension.
15352	She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation.
15353	Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done.
15354	No report of recent GI bleeding.
15355	In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s.
15356	Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%.
15357	Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given.
15358	Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.)
15359	Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection.
15360	CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis.
15361	After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus.

15534	Can&#8217;t rule out SBP in setting of ascites and abdominal pain, but seems less likely.
15535	Does have bilateral pleural effusions, but these are chronic and without other signs of empyema, and small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.
15536	Goals of care are decidedly conservative.
15537	Shock, likely 2/2 urosepsis: Foley placed, purulent material returned.
15538	Culture pending.
15539	Got Vanc 1 gm in ED at approximately noon, 2 gm cefepime at noon.
15540	-continue cefepime 1 gm daily
15541	-vanc 1 gm with HD
15542	-consider diagnostic paracentesis tonight (daughter said this procedure seems reasonable), but would be of limited value given diagnostic only and more likely source of UTI
15543	-with finding of proctitis on CT, will add IV flagyl 
15544	Hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions: on 4-5 L, suspect fluid overload as culprit
15545	-could consider therapeutic thoracentesis if this would allow more aggressive fluid resuscitation, but should discuss with daughter first
15546	ESRD: renal following, will consider HD tomorrow, pending labs/hemodynamics
15547	h/o GI bleeds: hct seems stable without evidence for bleed as cause of shock, but follow Hct in AM
15548	DM: SSI
15549	HTN: holding anti-hypertensives
15550	Goals of care: as above, no surgeries/invasive interventions/ICU level care
15551	Med recon: PAML created from last discharge med list; have requested current med list from NGH, not yet received by fax
15552	FEN:  
15553	-boluses tonight as needed
15554	-follow lytes
15555	-NPO for now given mental status, active resuscitation
15556	PPX:
15557	-GI:  continue omeprazole if awake enough to take POs     
15558	-DVT: subq heparin

15568	PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Syncope.
15569	HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Seventy-year-old female with 
15570	diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease complaining about 
15571	syncopal episode today.
15572	The patient states that over the last 
15573	couple of weeks she has had increased chest palpitations and two 
15574	weeks ago was given an event monitor which he has intermittently 
15575	worn saying it is difficult to wear during the heat wave.
15576	This 
15577	a.m. the patient had a syncopal episode while watching a 
15578	disagreement between her two grandchildren.
15579	The patient states had

15618	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
15619	numerous complaints.
15620	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
15621	since her upper respiratory tract infection.
15622	She had the flu in January 
15623	and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
15624	weeks ago.
15625	She states that this has severely debilitated her.
15626	She is 
15627	complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
15628	occasional dull headache.
15629	However, her main concern is her stomach and 
15630	her back.
15631	Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
15632	in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.
15633	This is different than her 
15634	reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
15635	Prilosec-Propulsid combination.
15636	She is describing some anorexia, although 
15637	she has not lost any weight.
15638	She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
15639	movements.
15640	She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.
15641	She wonders 
15642	whether this could be in gallbladder.
15643	In addition, she is continuing to 
15644	have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
15645	distribution.
15646	She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
15647	back.
15648	Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.
15649	She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.
15650	Her sugars 
15651	have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.
15652	Her blood 
15653	pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.
15654	She is saturating well.
15655	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.
15656	There was no JVD.
15657	Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ?
15658	S3 
15659	with no significant murmur.
15660	Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
15661	mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.
15662	Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.
15663	Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.
15664	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
15665	issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
15666	and cerebrovascular disease.
15667	She came in today for discussion of her 
15668	ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
15669	With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
15670	codeine, which has helped in the past.
15671	I gave her a prescription.
15672	I 
15673	warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.
15674	She should 
15675	contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
15676	steroid injection.
15677	With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
15678	postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
15679	disease.
15680	Unclear contribution from her reflux.
15681	Dr. Mario Robison 
15682	recommended elective cholecystectomy.
15683	Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
15684	being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to 
15685	page 2 
15686	consider her for the surgery.
15687	I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
15688	make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
15689	make an informed decision about the surgery.
15690	She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
15691	a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.
15692	She would probably do better 
15693	with lower blood pressure.
15694	We could consider increasing her Imdur.
15695	I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

15818	REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.
15819	Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.
15820	She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
15821	She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.
15822	She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.
15823	She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
15824	There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.
15825	She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.
15826	She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
15827	There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
15828	The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.
15829	The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
15830	She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.
15831	She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
15832	Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.
15833	She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
15834	Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
15835	and atenolol 50 mg q.d.
15836	She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
15837	Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
15838	Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
15839	She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
15840	Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
15841	On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.
15842	Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.
15843	Head and neck were unremarkable.
15844	Chest is clear.
15845	Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
15846	PMI is normal.
15847	S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.
15848	There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
15849	There is no S3.
15850	Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
15851	Bowel sounds are normal.
15852	Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
15853	Calf site is clean without bruits.
15854	Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
15855	Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
15856	Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.
15857	Liver function tests are normal.
15858	A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.
15859	Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
15860	She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.
15861	At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.
15862	We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.
15863	She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
15864	At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

16432	   Since last seen, Ursula notes that her weight continues to rise, and with this, her angina is clearly worse.
16433	She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.
16434	Medications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage

16458	Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.
16459	First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.
16460	She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.
16461	She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.
16462	It gets better when she rests.
16463	She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.

16609	RE:  Jennifer Vance
16610	     MR #542-66-00-3
16611	Dear Vester:
16612	Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
16613	evaluation.
16614	As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it
16615	briefly for our records.
16616	Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
16617	a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and
16618	significant coronary artery disease.
16619	In 2061, after a four to five
16620	day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to
16621	the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
16622	revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
16623	She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
16624	inadequate results.
16625	She therefore was taken electively for
16626	coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
16627	internal mammary artery to her LAD.
16628	She subsequently continued to
16629	have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
16630	in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
16631	stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
16632	stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
16633	The catheterization
16634	report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
16635	artery graft.
16636	Since then, she has continued to have episodes of
16637	intermittent abdominal discomfort.
16638	She recently has undergone an
16639	extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
16640	abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
16641	Trials
16642	of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
16643	In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test
16644	exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak
16645	blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
16646	She had no
16647	ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
16648	Over the past two weeks
16649	however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome
16650	(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
16651	includes radiation to her left shoulder.
16652	The pain is not
16653	exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity.
16654	The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
16655	Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a
16656	cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.
16657	Vance, Jennifer
16658	MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069
16659	Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin
16660	dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's
16661	contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.
16662	Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,
16663	NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.
16664	Allergies:  None.
16665	Cigarettes - none.
16666	Ethanol - social.
16667	Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,
16668	mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one
16669	brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother
16670	dying from melanoma age 36.
16671	The rest of her siblings and children
16672	have not heart disease.
16673	Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress.
16674	Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,
16675	respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.
16676	The neck is
16677	supple.
16678	JVP flat.
16679	Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
16680	greater than left bruits.
16681	Chest is clear.
16682	Cardiac exam shows a
16683	normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection
16684	murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant
16685	diastolic murmur.
16686	The abdomen is benign.
16687	Extremities reveal no
16688	appreciable edema.
16689	Peripheral pulses are intact.
16690	Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
16691	PR interval
16692	of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.
16693	There are minor
16694	nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
16695	Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
16696	variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and
16697	dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
16698	She has had a
16699	retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
16700	most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
16701	significant provokable ischemia.
16702	Nonetheless, I am concerned that
16703	her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
16704	I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
16705	I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
16706	studies.
16707	In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
16708	dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive
16709	antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
16710	Unless her variegata porphyria
16711	precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po
16712	q.d.
16713	I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
16714	In
16715	addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d.
16716	and
16717	I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
16718	porphyria does not 
16719	MR #542-66-00-3                    -3-            July 18, 2069
16720	preclude this.
16721	She understands that if she has evidence for
16722	significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
16723	to undergo repeat coronary angiography.
16724	Thank you very much for
16725	allowing me to assist in her care.

16774	pound above her weight of six months ago.
16775	The neck is supple.
16776	JVP 
16777	is flat.
16778	Carotids  with continuing right greater than left bruits.
16779	Chest is clear.
16780	Cardiac exam reveals a normal, physiologically
16781	split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the
16782	apex to the base.
16783	No significant diastolic murmur.
16784	The abdomen is
16785	benign.
16786	Extremities are without edema.
16787	The pulses are intact.
16788	Electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, PR interval

16896	Dear Dr. Fernandes:
16897	  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.
16898	It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.
16899	As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.
16900	Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.
16901	When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.
16902	At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.
16903	Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.
16904	Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
16905	Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
16906	He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
16907	He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.
16908	From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.
16909	We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.
16910	Past medical history:
16911	   Hypertension.
16912	Hyperlipidemia.
16913	CAD.

16937	-Heent:   Benign
16938	-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits
16939	-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs
16940	-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.
16941	S1 and S2.
16942	There is no murmur, rub, or gallop
16943	-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.
16944	There are no masses or bruits appreciated
16945	-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.
16946	Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.
16947	Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration
16948	-BP: 145/80    on the right
16949	"	Other Data:"
16950	   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.
16951	Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.
16952	Hypospadias repair in childhood.
16953	Assessment and plan:
16954	   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.
16955	Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
16956	Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.
16957	On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.
16958	We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.
16959	Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e.
16960	CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.
16961	Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.
16962	It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
16963	Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.
16964	We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
16965	He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
16966	He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
16967	With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.
16968	Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.
16969	We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

16983	I saw this patient and personally obtained the history of present illness.
16984	I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS.
16985	I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.
16986	I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data.
16987	I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans.
16988	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.

17001	Dear Dr. Cooper:
17002	  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease.
17003	I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.
17004	Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.
17005	This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.
17006	The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.
17007	They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.
17008	While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.
17009	He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.
17010	The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.
17011	As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight.
17012	He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.
17013	He is struggling with the decision.
17014	I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.
17015	In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.
17016	Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.
17017	He has no ulcers or gangrene.
17018	From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.
17019	He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.
17020	It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.
17021	While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.
17022	He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.
17023	Otherwise, Chris is doing great.
17024	We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.
17025	We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.
17026	If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.
17027	Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.
17028	Other Data:
17029	   I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note.
17030	We will send this along to you as well.

17151	RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.
17152	Dear Dr. Cooper:
17153	  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes.
17154	As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history.
17155	He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093.
17156	He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries.
17157	As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.
17158	He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA.
17159	He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.
17160	Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.
17161	He returns today for review.
17162	He remains in reasonable health.
17163	He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery.
17164	He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side.
17165	He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina.
17166	However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study.
17167	He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.

17230	Impression:
17231	   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication.
17232	He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia.
17233	Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.
17234	Assessment and plan:
17235	   1.
17236	CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.
17237	2.
17238	PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.
17239	3.
17240	Carotid disease; currently asymptomatic, will repeat CANIs.

17267	I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS.
17268	I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.
17269	I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.
17270	My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.
17271	Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG.
17272	He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors.
17273	but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.

17519	      Assessment and plan:
17520	    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG.
17521	Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI).
17522	A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.
17523	Problems:
17524	Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief.
17525	Takes it about once/month.
17526	These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.
17527	A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%.
17528	I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.
17529	Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal!
17530	I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.
17531	Continue her present dose of statin.
17532	HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today.
17533	Continue her current regimen.

17556	History of Present Illness
17557	Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.
17558	Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE.
17559	Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.
17560	He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.
17561	He refused further work-up or intervention until recently.
17562	He presents now for cath and surgery.

17742	EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.
17743	Assessment/Plan
17744	 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes.
17745	Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial.
17746	S/P Rt TMA.
17747	Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
17748	By issue:
17749	1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance.
17750	The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
17751	If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option.
17752	In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.
17753	Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx.
17754	I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.
17755	If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.
17756	2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
17757	He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes.
17758	Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
17759	Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
17760	Might hold ranitidine as well.
17761	Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
17762	Currently on olanzapine.
17763	Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
17764	Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
17765	3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
17766	Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
17767	All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
17768	Would seek ID input to the end.
17769	Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.
17770	4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today .
17771	Recs per nephrology
17772	3) DM: HgA1c was at target.
17773	Please cover as needed with RISS for now.
17774	5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time.
17775	Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP.
17776	Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
17777	Thanks,

17989	Dear Dr. Huerta:
17990	Reason for visit:
17991	   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic.
17992	He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light.
17993	He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069.
17994	He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling.
17995	He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.
17996	He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then.
17997	Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities.
17998	Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000.
17999	He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia.
18000	The patient has been managed medically since then.
18001	He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
18002	The patient has been doing well over the past several months.
18003	Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool.
18004	A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday.
18005	His weight has been up and down.
18006	He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
18007	Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat.
18008	I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.
18009	Past medical history:
18010	   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.
18011	Current Medications:
18012	  lisinopril 20 mg QD
18013	 Glucophage 1 g BID
18014	 glyburide 10 mg BID
18015	 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM
18016	 Lopid 600 mg BID
18017	 allopurinol 300 mg QD
18018	 omeprazole 20 mg QD
18019	 aspirin 81 mg QD
18020	 Pravachol 80 mg QD
18021	 Avandia 8 mg QD
18022	Allergies:
18023	Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.
18024	Family history:
18025	   Not significant for coronary artery disease.
18026	Social history:
18027	   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.
18028	Review of systems:
18029	   As above, otherwise negative.
18030	Physical examination:
18031	-Pulse:   60
18032	-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress
18033	-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally
18034	-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.
18035	PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.
18036	Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
18037	Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border
18038	-Abdomen:   Obese and tender
18039	-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes
18040	Selected recent labs:
18041	   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.
18042	His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.
18043	Assessment and plan:
18044	   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed.
18045	He is doing well.
18046	He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
18047	He is currently not anticoagulated.
18048	Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70.
18049	He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
18050	If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen.
18051	He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
18052	The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.
18053	In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day.
18054	Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.
18055	Changes to Medications this visit

18216	HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter.
18217	Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR.
18218	Pt did well post cardioversion.
18219	He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis.
18220	Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically.
18221	Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology.
18222	He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter.
18223	Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73.
18224	The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm.
18225	He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

18399	Patient Name Here: Olivo, Kimberly
18400	MR# 3299811
18401	Location: Suite 53-02Q
18402	"Date of Admission:  December 15, 2091	"
18403	"PCP:	Isaac Ng "
18404	"ID/CC:	Change in mental status"
18405	HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days.
18406	Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission.
18407	As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days.
18408	They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused.
18409	The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day.
18410	On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night.
18411	She also forgot the names of her grandchildren.
18412	The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.
18413	The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.
18414	She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.
18415	ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB.
18416	Blood Pressure: Treated with labetalol 10 mg IV x 1, Hydral 10 mg IV x 1, decreased to 176/74.
18417	Hyponatremia: NS x 1 L
18418	PMH:
18419	Pituitary adenoma  2080 s/p resection, XRT
18420	Diabetes mellitus Type II - On Humulin 15/15 
18421	Hypertension - on Avapro, allergy to Ace-I
18422	Angina pectoris - negative stress 
18423	Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH.
18424	Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.
18425	Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis
18426	Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT
18427	Arthritis   
18428	Cryptogenic cirrhosis - HIV, HBV, HCV negative (4/90), ANA negative, Anti-mitochondrial Ab negative, no evidence of hemachromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency or Wilson's disease on biopsy, findings consistent with NASH.

18726	R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration
18727	Critical Care Min: 35 min
18728	History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness.
18729	BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived.
18730	Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.

18732	and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.
18733	She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.
18734	CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.
18735	She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management.

18772	Assessment: 
18773	Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.
18774	The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly.
18775	A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI.

19563	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
19564	gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
19565	post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.
19566	1.
19567	He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.
19568	These are 
19569	improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
19570	128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
19571	ranging from 150 to 190.
19572	He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
19573	units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
19574	at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.
19575	He has not had any 
19576	further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
19577	seems to be sticking more to the diet.
19578	He has however gained some 
19579	weight, which is a little disconcerting.
19580	He does attend a podiatrist 
19581	and is doing well from that perspective.
19582	He is to return to the 
19583	ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.
19584	He 
19585	missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
19586	follow-up with nutrition at this time.
19587	2.
19588	Cardiovascular.
19589	He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
19590	atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.
19591	Further question regarding his stroke back 
19592	in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
19593	unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
19594	to have a hole in his heart at that time.
19595	He was eventually stopped off 
19596	Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
19597	put on Coumadin for life at that point.
19598	He had an aborted myocardial 
19599	infarction in 2067.
19600	He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
19601	exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
19602	yards before getting very short of breath.
19603	He has no orthopnea or PND.
19604	He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
19605	3.
19606	Health maintenance.
19607	We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
19608	flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.
19609	has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
19610	his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
19611	checked on the day prior to the test.
19612	This will be scheduled by our 
19613	secretary.
19614	He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
19615	standard dose and titrate up slowly.
19616	CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
19617	Lipitor.
19618	Page 2
19619	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.
19620	He is tachycardic 
19621	at 98 beats per minute.
19622	Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
19623	sided cataract.
19624	Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.
19625	The 
19626	abdominal examination is also normal.
19627	His injection sites were clean 
19628	and without erythema.
19629	There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
19630	his feet appeared well.
19631	We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
19632	including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.
19633	PLAN:
19634	Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
19635	including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
19636	and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
19637	I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
19638	left the other doses as is.
19639	I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
19640	and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
19641	4.
19642	We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
19643	5.
19644	I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
19645	above for colorectal cancer screening.
19646	6.
19647	Return to see in a week's time, understands.
19648	He can discuss any 
19649	management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

20458	  Followup of multiple issues.
20459	History of present illness
20460	  Since his last visit, the patient has had two episodes of pressure in his chest.
20461	This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package.
20462	"He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt ""tired in his chest""."
20463	He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved.
20464	He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100.
20465	He has had no syncope or near syncope.
20466	Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week.

20616	  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.
20617	History of present illness
20618	  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.
20619	Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.
20620	He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.
20621	At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.
20622	He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.
20623	He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.
20624	He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.
20625	He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.
20626	He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.
20627	He is here for a followup.
20628	Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.
20629	His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

20726	He was volume depleted at his last visit.
20727	Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.
20728	His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.
20729	His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.
20730	His weight control has been a problem.
20731	He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.
20732	He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

20930	Reactions to Medicines: None
20931	Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness
20932	History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.
20933	He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
20934	In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
20935	He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
20936	On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.
20937	He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.
20938	He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.
20939	ROS:Const.-Negative
20940	Eyes -Negative
20941	ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss
20942	CV: See above
20943	Respiratory: Sleep apnea
20944	GI -.
20945	Recent constipation  
20946	GU -Impotence.
20947	Urgency and incontinence  
20948	MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.
20949	Considering knee replacement
20950	Skin - Negative
20951	Neuro -CVA in past.
20952	Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.
20953	Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa
20954	Endocrine -  Diabetes
20955	Heme-No blood problems
20956	Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye
20957	Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
20958	He has no other major illnesses.
20959	He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.
20960	Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.
20961	Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
20962	Two sisters are living without diabetes.
20963	Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.
20964	He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.
20965	His significant other works as an optician.
20966	She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.
20967	Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
20968	BP 100 50/65.
20969	His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.
20970	He has no rales.
20971	He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.
20972	He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
20973	EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA
20974	Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
20975	He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
20976	In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
20977	I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
20978	I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
20979	Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
20980	I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
20981	Of course the catheterization will determine that.
20982	He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

21096	Dear Hicks,
21097	I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
21098	She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.
21099	As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.
21100	She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
21101	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.
21102	She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
21103	Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.
21104	It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.
21105	She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
21106	You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
21107	Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
21108	She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.
21109	She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
21110	She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
21111	She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
21112	In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.
21113	Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.
21114	She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
21115	She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
21116	Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
21117	Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.
21118	She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.
21119	She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.
21120	She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
21121	As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.
21122	On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.
21123	In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.
21124	She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
21125	She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
21126	Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
21127	Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
21128	Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.
21129	Her abdomen is benign.
21130	She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
21131	Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.
21132	Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.
21133	In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.
21134	An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
21135	There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
21136	There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.
21137	In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.
21138	She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
21139	However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
21140	As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.
21141	Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.
21142	However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.
21143	During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.
21144	I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
21145	We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
21146	If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.
21147	I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
21148	As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.
21149	This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
21150	It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
21151	We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
21152	Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
21153	Sincerely,
21154	______________________________

21164	71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.
21165	Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl.
21166	She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.
21167	She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.
21168	For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram.
21169	The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.
21170	Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.
21171	Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain.
21172	She was seen in pain clinic for two injections.
21173	She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned.
21174	She says this is her most limiting symptom.
21175	She is begging for narcotics.
21176	Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.
