280	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
281	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
282	2	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
283	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
284	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
285	0	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
286	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
287	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
288	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
289	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
290	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
291	0	a	Chest was clear.
292	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
293	0	a	No S3 or S4.
294	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
295	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
296	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
297	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
298	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
299	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
300	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
301	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
302	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

1172	0	a	RE: Benitez, Wonda
1173	0	a	MR: 89276954
1174	0	a	Dear Usha:
1175	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
1176	0	a	Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
1177	2	a	post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.
1178	0	a	As you
1179	0	a	know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
1180	0	a	wall ischemia.
1181	0	a	I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new.
1182	2	a	On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
1183	0	a	have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.
1184	0	a	Therefore,
1185	0	a	I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
1186	0	a	probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
1187	0	a	bypass this area.
1188	0	a	She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
1189	0	a	venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal.
1190	0	a	She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
1191	0	a	recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.
1192	0	a	However,
1193	0	a	she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
1194	0	a	history of otitis media in her right ear.
1195	0	a	Therefore, I think it
1196	0	a	wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
1197	0	a	her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.
1198	0	a	In the
1199	0	a	meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
1200	0	a	nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
1201	0	a	these episodes.
1202	0	a	I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
1203	0	a	these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
1204	0	a	with her cardiovascular system.
1205	0	a	She will return to see me in
1206	0	a	follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
1207	0	a	cholesterol level.
1208	0	a	Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your

1286	0	a	CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents
1287	0	a	HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.
1288	0	a	He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).
1289	0	a	She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.
1290	0	a	He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.
1291	0	a	His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.
1292	0	a	He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.
1293	0	a	The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.

1311	0	a	A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.
1312	0	a	His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.
1313	0	a	He is being managed by ID.
1314	0	a	His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.
1315	0	a	His abdominal CT is pending.
1316	0	a	He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.
1317	0	a	As such, we recommend:
1318	0	a	--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
1319	0	a	--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
1320	0	a	Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.
1321	0	a	Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.
1322	0	a	D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.
1323	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

1749	2	a	He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.
1750	0	a	He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.
1751	0	a	Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.
1752	0	a	He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.
1753	0	a	I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.
1754	0	a	On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.
1755	0	a	His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.
1756	0	a	His lungs were clear bilaterally.
1757	0	a	He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.

1771	0	a	Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
1772	0	a	Background:
1773	0	a	Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
1774	0	a	She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
1775	0	a	She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain.
1776	0	a	Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
1777	0	a	She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70.
1778	0	a	Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face.
1779	2	a	The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.

2324	0	a	ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.
2325	0	a	She is a 
2326	0	a	70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
2327	0	a	fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
2328	2	a	Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
2329	0	a	history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
2330	0	a	diminution after the surgery.
2331	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
2332	0	a	Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
2333	0	a	20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.
2334	0	a	She is also 
2335	0	a	taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.
2336	0	a	The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.
2337	0	a	Her blood 
2338	0	a	pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
2339	0	a	been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
2340	0	a	150 all the way up to 450.
2341	0	a	We have made some adjustments recently in 
2342	0	a	her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
2343	0	a	Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
2344	0	a	been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
2345	0	a	medicines without problems.
2346	0	a	She does note that she is having some pain 
2347	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
2348	0	a	The 
2349	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
2350	0	a	wanes over time.
2351	0	a	The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
2352	0	a	this.
2353	0	a	The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
2354	0	a	fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
2355	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
2356	0	a	walks with a walker today.
2357	0	a	Blood pressure: 144/76.
2358	0	a	Pulse: 78 and 
2359	0	a	regular.
2360	0	a	Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
2361	0	a	Her heart 
2362	0	a	is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
2363	0	a	She has got a regular rate and 
2364	0	a	rhythm today.
2365	0	a	Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
2366	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
2367	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
2368	0	a	edema.
2369	0	a	Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
2370	0	a	into the sciatic notch on the left side.
2371	0	a	She has got otherwise joints 
2372	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
2373	0	a	There 
2374	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
2375	0	a	Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
2376	0	a	monitoring.
2377	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
2378	0	a	I will 
2379	0	a	not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
2380	0	a	I 
2381	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
2382	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
2383	0	a	remits on it's own.

2385	0	a	PAGE 2
2386	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
2387	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
2388	0	a	She is 
2389	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
2390	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
2391	0	a	I have discussed this 
2392	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
2393	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
2394	0	a	I will talk 
2395	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
2396	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
2397	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
2398	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
2399	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
2400	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
2401	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

2415	0	a	CC:  L leg/foot pain
2416	0	a	History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.
2417	0	a	He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
2418	0	a	However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.
2419	0	a	This lasted for ~24 hours.
2420	0	a	He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.
2421	0	a	He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.
2422	0	a	He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.
2423	0	a	On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

2949	0	a	HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.
2950	0	a	The patient 
2951	0	a	is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
2952	2	a	coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
2953	0	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.
2954	0	a	The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.
2955	0	a	With regard to the 
2956	0	a	latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
2957	0	a	initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
2958	0	a	notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
2959	0	a	uncomfortable with this.
2960	0	a	He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
2961	0	a	pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
2962	0	a	of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.
2963	0	a	The patient knows the foods that give 
2964	0	a	him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
2965	0	a	avoid them as much as possible.
2966	0	a	The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
2967	0	a	which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
2968	0	a	would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
2969	0	a	blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
2970	0	a	we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).
2971	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
2972	0	a	the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
2973	0	a	of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.
2974	0	a	The patient does remain on 
2975	0	a	Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
2976	0	a	pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
2977	0	a	minutes later was 130/74.
2978	0	a	The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.
2979	0	a	No positive 
2980	0	a	review of systems.
2981	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.
2982	0	a	Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me 
2983	0	a	was 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, 
2984	0	a	respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.

2988	0	a	Hypertension.
2989	0	a	The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as 
2990	0	a	     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.
2991	0	a	His blood pressure 
2992	0	a	     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
2993	0	a	One of the issues 
2994	0	a	     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.
2995	0	a	"The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and "
2996	2	a	     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
2997	0	a	     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
2998	0	a	     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
2999	0	a	     Zestril with a beta-blocker.

3009	0	a	     months, although he should be able to experience relief almost 
3010	0	a	     immediately.
3011	0	a	The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which 
3012	0	a	     may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux.

3014	0	a	BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to 
3015	0	a	     be working quite well.
3016	0	a	The patient notes that there is less 
3017	0	a	     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.
3018	0	a	The patient does take Lasix 
3019	0	a	     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any

3026	0	a	The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
3027	0	a	     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG 
3028	0	a	     changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he 
3029	0	a	     would like to stay on this.
3030	0	a	Patient has enough to last until I see 
3031	0	a	     him next time.
3032	0	a	I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
3033	0	a	patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.
3034	0	a	The cholesterol 
3035	0	a	is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the

3054	0	a	Consult for radial artery harvest
3055	1	a	HPI:  74 RHD M with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type II DM, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia.
3056	0	a	On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.
3057	2	a	This was complicated by a postoperative MI.
3058	0	a	03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
3059	1	a	is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.
3060	0	a	Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.
3061	0	a	He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.
3062	0	a	We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

3473	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
3474	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
3475	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
3476	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
3477	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
3478	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
3479	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
3480	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
3481	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
3482	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
3483	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
3484	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
3485	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
3486	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).

3673	0	a	I/P: 
3674	0	a	73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
3675	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
3676	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
3677	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
3678	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
3679	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
3680	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
3681	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
3682	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
3683	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

3693	0	a	"h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake."
3694	0	a	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
3695	2	a	Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.
3696	0	a	hypoglycemia).
3697	2	a	This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.
3698	0	a	The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.
3699	0	a	Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
3700	0	a	The dizziness was positional in nature.
3701	0	a	The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms.
3702	0	a	In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.
3703	0	a	"a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour."
3704	0	a	b.
3705	0	a	Check orthostatics daily.
3706	0	a	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.
