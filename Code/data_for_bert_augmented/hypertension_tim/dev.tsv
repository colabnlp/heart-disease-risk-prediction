323	0	a	This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
324	0	a	At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
325	0	a	Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
326	0	a	She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
327	0	a	I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
328	0	a	She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
329	0	a	She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
330	0	a	Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.
331	0	a	If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

481	0	a	A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.
482	0	a	She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.
483	0	a	This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.
484	0	a	Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.
485	0	a	In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.
486	0	a	Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
487	0	a	Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.
488	0	a	Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.
489	0	a	Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.
490	0	a	Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.
491	0	a	Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.
492	0	a	However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.
493	0	a	She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
494	0	a	She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.
495	0	a	Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.
496	0	a	Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.
497	0	a	However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.
498	0	a	The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.
499	0	a	Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.
500	0	a	There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
501	0	a	There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state
502	0	a	Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.
503	0	a	She had a recent stress test that was negative.
504	0	a	However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.
505	0	a	However, this would not cause the delirium.
506	0	a	Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.
507	0	a	Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.
508	0	a	Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.

844	0	a	Baxter Springs, MO  64715
845	0	a	HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.
846	3	a	He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking.
847	0	a	He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
848	0	a	He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
849	0	a	He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
850	0	a	He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.
851	0	a	He has not had any rest pain.
852	0	a	For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.
853	0	a	He then had a left brachial artery.
854	0	a	Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
855	0	a	There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.
856	0	a	With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.
857	0	a	He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.
858	0	a	He is married and lives in Missouri.
859	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.
860	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.
861	0	a	Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.
862	0	a	He had no jugular venous distention.
863	0	a	Chest was clear.
864	0	a	Heart had normal S1 and S2.
865	0	a	No S3 or S4.
866	0	a	There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
867	0	a	His abdomen was benign.
868	0	a	Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.
869	0	a	IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.
870	0	a	His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.
871	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
872	0	a	We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
873	0	a	We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
874	0	a	We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

1089	0	a	Diabetes.
1090	0	a	The patient was advised that his laboratory
1091	0	a	testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset
1092	0	a	diabetes.
1093	0	a	Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

1095	0	a	Use and side effects

1097	0	a	He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and
1098	0	a	fasting lipid profile checked today.
1099	0	a	Unfortunately, he was not
1100	0	a	actually fasting.
1101	0	a	He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and
1102	0	a	Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education.
1103	0	a	He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.
1104	0	a	He is asked
1105	0	a	to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.
1106	0	a	was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens
1107	0	a	swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.
1108	0	a	I assume that this
1109	0	a	will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.
1110	0	a	was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job
1111	0	a	until his symptoms clear.
1112	0	a	2.
1113	0	a	Migraines.
1114	0	a	The patient does sound as if he is also having

1116	0	a	We will address this at future visits.

1499	0	a	NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel
1500	0	a	MRN:     8514931
1501	3	a	The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,
1502	0	a	hyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems.
1503	0	a	She has a history of TIAs and
1504	0	a	was seeing the neurologist today for follow up.
1505	0	a	She has not had recent TIA symptoms
1506	0	a	but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.
1507	0	a	Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she
1508	0	a	has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she
1509	0	a	walks about one block.

1749	0	a	ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.
1750	0	a	She is a 
1751	0	a	70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
1752	0	a	fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
1753	0	a	Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
1754	0	a	history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
1755	0	a	diminution after the surgery.
1756	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
1757	0	a	Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
1758	0	a	20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.
1759	0	a	She is also 
1760	0	a	taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.
1761	0	a	The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.
1762	0	a	Her blood 
1763	2	a	pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
1764	0	a	been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
1765	0	a	150 all the way up to 450.
1766	0	a	We have made some adjustments recently in 
1767	0	a	her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
1768	0	a	Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
1769	0	a	been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
1770	0	a	medicines without problems.

1772	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
1773	0	a	The 
1774	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
1775	0	a	wanes over time.

1777	0	a	this.
1778	0	a	The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
1779	0	a	fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
1780	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
1781	0	a	walks with a walker today.
1782	3	a	Blood pressure: 144/76.
1783	0	a	Pulse: 78 and 
1784	0	a	regular.
1785	0	a	Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
1786	0	a	Her heart 
1787	0	a	is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
1788	0	a	She has got a regular rate and 
1789	0	a	rhythm today.
1790	0	a	Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
1791	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
1792	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
1793	0	a	edema.
1794	0	a	Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
1795	0	a	into the sciatic notch on the left side.
1796	0	a	She has got otherwise joints 
1797	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
1798	0	a	There 
1799	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
1800	0	a	Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
1801	0	a	monitoring.
1802	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
1803	0	a	I will 
1804	0	a	not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
1805	0	a	I 
1806	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
1807	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
1808	0	a	remits on it's own.

1810	0	a	PAGE 2
1811	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
1812	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
1813	0	a	She is 
1814	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
1815	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
1816	0	a	I have discussed this 
1817	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
1818	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
1819	0	a	I will talk 
1820	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
1821	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
1822	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
1823	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
1824	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
1825	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
1826	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

1841	0	a	Post, IN  86454
1842	0	a	Dear Dr. Nall:
1843	0	a	It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
1844	0	a	As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.
1845	0	a	He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.
1846	3	a	He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.
1847	0	a	He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.
1848	0	a	His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
1849	0	a	He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.
1850	0	a	He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
1851	0	a	In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.
1852	0	a	Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o.
1853	0	a	daily lifelong.
1854	0	a	We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.
1855	0	a	Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.
1856	0	a	He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
1857	0	a	He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
1858	0	a	He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
1859	2	a	He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.
1860	0	a	His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
1861	0	a	He has had no side effects to his medications.
1862	0	a	He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
1863	0	a	He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.
1864	0	a	His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
1865	0	a	daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
1866	0	a	daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
1867	0	a	daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.
1868	0	a	daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o.
1869	0	a	b.i.d.
1870	0	a	Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
1871	3	a	His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.
1872	0	a	His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
1873	0	a	There are no bruits.
1874	0	a	His chest is clear to auscultation.
1875	0	a	He was not clubbed.
1876	0	a	His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.
1877	0	a	He had no peripheral edema.
1878	0	a	His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
1879	0	a	His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
1880	0	a	EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.
1881	0	a	Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
1882	0	a	Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.
1883	0	a	TSH was also normal.
1884	0	a	Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
1885	0	a	Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.
1886	0	a	Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
1887	0	a	Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.
1888	0	a	Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.
1889	0	a	We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
1890	0	a	He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
1891	0	a	To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
1892	0	a	We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
1893	0	a	He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
1894	0	a	With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.
1895	0	a	Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.
1896	0	a	The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.
1897	0	a	To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.
1898	0	a	We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.
1899	0	a	Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.
1900	0	a	We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
1901	0	a	If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.
1902	0	a	He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
1903	0	a	This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
1904	0	a	Yours sincerely,

2281	0	a	Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty.
2282	0	a	He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.
2283	0	a	He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg.

2352	0	a	ASSESSMENT:
2353	0	a	Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.
2354	0	a	PLAN:
2355	0	a	1.
2356	0	a	His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department.
2357	0	a	Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
2358	0	a	Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
2359	0	a	Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
2360	0	a	Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
2361	0	a	Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
2362	0	a	2.
2363	0	a	We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future.
2364	0	a	If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys.
2365	0	a	We are awaiting his expert opinion.
2366	0	a	3.
2367	0	a	Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
2368	0	a	Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained.
2369	0	a	However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
2370	0	a	4.
2371	0	a	We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
2372	0	a	5.
2373	0	a	If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.
2374	0	a	We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

2379	0	a	I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
2380	0	a	In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.
2381	0	a	Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
2382	0	a	He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
2383	0	a	His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
2384	0	a	His options are:
2385	0	a	1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
2386	0	a	2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
2387	0	a	3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication
2388	0	a	We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

2570	0	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
2571	1	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
2572	0	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
2573	0	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
2574	0	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
2575	0	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
2576	0	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
2577	0	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
2578	0	a	Recommendations:
2579	0	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
2580	0	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
2581	0	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
2582	0	a	-Continue statin.
2583	0	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

2636	0	a	Dear Dr. Dillon:
2637	3	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.
2638	0	a	Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.
2639	0	a	She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.
2640	0	a	She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.
2641	0	a	Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o.
2642	0	a	q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o.
2643	0	a	q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o.
2644	0	a	q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o.
2645	0	a	q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o.
2646	0	a	q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o.
2647	0	a	q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.
2648	3	a	Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.
2649	0	a	She is comfortable seated on the exam table.
2650	0	a	Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.
2651	0	a	There are very rare crackles at the bases.
2652	0	a	Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.
2653	0	a	P2 is increased.
2654	0	a	There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.
2655	0	a	She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.
2656	0	a	Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.
2657	0	a	There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.
2658	0	a	In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.
2659	0	a	She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.
2660	3	a	In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o.
2661	0	a	q.d.
2662	0	a	She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.
2663	0	a	I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.
2664	0	a	It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.
2665	0	a	Sincerely yours,

2804	0	a	Dear Dr.
2805	0	a	Craft,
2806	0	a	I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.
2807	0	a	This lovely gentleman with coronary artery
2808	0	a	disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction
2809	0	a	notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,
2810	0	a	who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.
2811	0	a	Despite this
2812	0	a	intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,
2813	0	a	palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present
2814	0	a	time.
2815	0	a	He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg
2816	0	a	p.o.
2817	0	a	t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,
2818	0	a	simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o.
2819	0	a	b.i.d., Prevacid,
2820	0	a	multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.
2821	3	a	On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.
2822	0	a	His heart
2823	0	a	rate is 54 and regular.
2824	0	a	Respiratory rate is 10.
2825	0	a	There is no
2826	0	a	increase in jugular venous pressure.
2827	0	a	Carotids are without
2828	0	a	bruits.
2829	0	a	Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.
2830	0	a	Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and
2831	0	a	physiologically split S2.
2832	0	a	His abdomen is soft and nontender.
2833	0	a	He
2834	0	a	has no bruits.
2835	0	a	His extremities are warm with strong symmetric
2836	0	a	pulses and motor strength throughout.
2837	0	a	He has no peripheral edema
2838	0	a	at the present time.
2839	0	a	His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus
2840	0	a	bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,
2841	0	a	and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior
2842	0	a	electrocardiograms.
2843	0	a	Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a
2844	0	a	concerning blood pressure.
2845	0	a	At this point, he notes that he is
2846	0	a	actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue
2847	0	a	to do that.
2848	0	a	We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will
2849	0	a	be following up with you within the next few weeks.
2850	0	a	If there are
2851	0	a	any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me
2852	0	a	a call.

2873	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
2874	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
2875	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
2876	3	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
2877	0	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
2878	0	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
2879	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
2880	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
2881	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
2882	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
2883	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
2884	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
2885	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.
2886	0	a	Medications:
2887	0	a	atenolol 50mg qday

2933	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
2934	3	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
2935	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
2936	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
2937	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
2938	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
2939	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
2940	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
2941	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
2942	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
2943	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
2944	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
2945	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
2946	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
2947	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
2948	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
2949	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
2950	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
2951	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.
2952	0	a	Sincerely,

3079	0	a	Reason for visit:
3080	0	a	   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
3081	0	a	She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
3082	0	a	Interval History:
3083	0	a	   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
3084	0	a	She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
3085	0	a	She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
3086	0	a	Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
3087	0	a	She had global hypokinesis.
3088	0	a	She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
3089	0	a	She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.
3090	0	a	Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
3091	0	a	d dimer 400 rnage.
3092	0	a	BNP elevated at 500.
3093	0	a	VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
3094	0	a	Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
3095	0	a	Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
3096	0	a	A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
3097	0	a	Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
3098	0	a	The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
3099	0	a	Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
3100	0	a	Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
3101	0	a	Lasix 20mg
3102	0	a	Toprol XL 50mg
3103	0	a	ASA 325mg
3104	0	a	Zestril 20mg
3105	0	a	Lantus 10 units hs
3106	0	a	Glucovance 2.5/500mg
3107	0	a	Multivitamin
3108	0	a	She relates that her dyspnea is better
3109	0	a	She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
3110	0	a	She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.

3150	0	a	Impression:
3151	0	a	   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
3152	0	a	Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
3153	0	a	She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
3154	0	a	Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
3155	0	a	At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.
3156	0	a	Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
3157	0	a	In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.
3158	0	a	She relates that she will call our office.

3688	0	a	HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
3689	0	a	     of general surgery.
3690	0	a	The patient had expressed an interest in considering
3691	0	a	     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
3692	0	a	Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
3693	0	a	     surgery.
3694	0	a	After extensive
3695	0	a	     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
3696	0	a	     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
3697	0	a	     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
3698	0	a	     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
3699	0	a	     to pursue this.
3700	0	a	Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
3701	0	a	Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.
3702	0	a	She will
3703	3	a	     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.
3704	0	a	Her chest wall pain is
3705	0	a	     likely due to esophageal spasm.
3706	0	a	Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
3707	0	a	Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
3708	0	a	     fibromyalgia.
3709	0	a	This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
3710	0	a	     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications.
3711	0	a	At the time, we
3712	0	a	     will continue pain medications for her comfort.
3713	0	a	Continue aggressive bowel
3714	0	a	     regimen.
3715	0	a	Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
3716	0	a	     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.
3717	0	a	The family currently
3718	0	a	     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
3719	0	a	Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
3720	0	a	     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
3721	0	a	     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.

3761	0	a	Past medical records.
3762	0	a	History of Present Illness  
3763	0	a	Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.
3764	0	a	He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.
3765	0	a	As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.
3766	0	a	He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.
3767	0	a	He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.
3768	0	a	Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.
3769	0	a	Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.
3770	0	a	He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.
3771	0	a	That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.
3772	0	a	He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.
3773	0	a	The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
3774	0	a	He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.
3775	0	a	He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
3776	0	a	Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.
3777	0	a	He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.
3778	0	a	In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.
3779	0	a	He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.
3780	0	a	CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
3781	0	a	Oncology History (per attending notes)
3782	0	a	Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
3783	0	a	On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.
3784	0	a	The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
3785	0	a	Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
3786	0	a	On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma.
3787	0	a	Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
3788	0	a	Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.
3789	0	a	On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
3790	0	a	This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.
3791	0	a	The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
3792	0	a	There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
3793	0	a	PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
3794	0	a	The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
3795	0	a	3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).
3796	0	a	His last Taxotere treatment was February 17; further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.

3982	0	a	I/P: 
3983	0	a	73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
3984	0	a	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum.
3985	0	a	Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.
3986	0	a	The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
3987	0	a	The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes.
3988	0	a	The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.
3989	0	a	The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
3990	0	a	Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.
3991	0	a	In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.
3992	0	a	Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

4446	0	a	HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.
4447	0	a	The 
4448	0	a	patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
4449	0	a	whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
4450	0	a	"which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of "
4451	3	a	benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.
4452	0	a	As it 
4453	0	a	turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
4454	0	a	beneficial effects of which were unknown.
4455	0	a	We had decided as of our last 
4456	0	a	meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.
4457	0	a	patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
4458	0	a	continue to discontinue this medicine.
4459	0	a	At this point, the patient does 
4460	0	a	not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.
4461	0	a	With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
4462	0	a	the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
4463	0	a	wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.
4464	0	a	Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.
4465	0	a	It is 
4466	3	a	noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
4467	2	a	the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
4468	0	a	diastolic was 80-90.
4469	0	a	The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
4470	0	a	than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.
4471	0	a	The patient 
4472	0	a	has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
4473	0	a	ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
4474	0	a	remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.
4475	0	a	The patient's 
4476	0	a	cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.
4477	0	a	Review 
4478	0	a	of systems otherwise negative.
4479	0	a	Physical exam is not performed at this time.
4480	3	a	Blood pressure was 152/76 
4481	0	a	on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
4482	0	a	and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
4483	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
4484	0	a	problems coming in for follow-up.
4485	0	a	1.
4486	0	a	Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
4487	3	a	     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
4488	0	a	     hypertrophy.
4489	0	a	The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
4490	0	a	     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
4491	0	a	     standing.
4492	0	a	The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
4493	0	a	     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
4494	0	a	     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.
4495	0	a	If 
4496	0	a	     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
4497	0	a	     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
4498	0	a	2.
4499	0	a	BPH - please see above.
4500	0	a	The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
4501	0	a	3.   ?
4502	0	a	coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
4503	0	a	     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
4504	0	a	     for this gentleman.
4505	0	a	I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
4506	0	a	     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s 
4507	0	a	     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL

4509	0	a	PAGE 2
4510	0	a	     or low 50s.
4511	0	a	Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
4512	0	a	     therapy.
4513	0	a	I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
4514	0	a	     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
4515	0	a	     will be put on an antilipid drug.
4516	0	a	4.
4517	0	a	GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
4518	0	a	     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
4519	0	a	     point.
4520	0	a	Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
4521	0	a	     placed on Prilosec.
4522	0	a	I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
4523	0	a	his use of Hytrin.

4643	0	a	PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.
4644	0	a	We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.
4645	0	a	Will check ESR today.
4646	0	a	Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.
4647	0	a	Depression:  She seems better.
4648	0	a	Continue Effexor.
4649	0	a	Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.
4650	0	a	Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.
4651	0	a	Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.
4652	0	a	Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.
4653	0	a	Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.
4654	0	a	Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
4655	0	a	Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
4656	0	a	Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
4657	0	a	Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
4658	0	a	DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
4659	0	a	Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
4660	0	a	Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
4661	0	a	Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
4662	0	a	Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.
4663	0	a	11.
4664	0	a	Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

4948	0	a	       783-61-34-3
4949	0	a	Dear Dr. Kay: 
4950	0	a	I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
4951	0	a	She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
4952	0	a	I will review her history for the record.
4953	0	a	She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.
4954	0	a	Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
4955	0	a	Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.
4956	0	a	This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
4957	0	a	During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
4958	0	a	(There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
4959	0	a	An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
4960	0	a	There was no abnormal enhancement.
4961	0	a	This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
4962	0	a	EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
4963	0	a	An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.
4964	0	a	CSF ACE was normal.
4965	0	a	Cultures were negative.
4966	0	a	CSF VDRL was negative.
4967	0	a	Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.
4968	0	a	She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
4969	0	a	Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.
4970	0	a	She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.
4971	0	a	Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.
4972	0	a	She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.
4973	0	a	Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).
4974	0	a	CSF HSV PCR was negative.
4975	0	a	HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
4976	0	a	She has a history of asthma going back many years.
4977	0	a	According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.
4978	0	a	Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.
4979	0	a	She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.
4980	0	a	Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
4981	1	a	She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.
4982	0	a	Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.
4983	0	a	She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.
4984	0	a	There is no history of allergy to PCN.
4985	0	a	Her parents both died of some type of cancer.
4986	0	a	There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.
4987	0	a	She is a widow.
4988	0	a	She has four children.
4989	0	a	She used to work for Lowe's.
4990	0	a	She now lives with a daughter.
4991	0	a	She has had no recent fever or chills.
4992	0	a	Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.
4993	0	a	There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.
4994	0	a	There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
4995	0	a	She has had no rash or joint symptoms.
4996	0	a	Pulse 126, regular.
4997	0	a	BP 126/66.
4998	0	a	She is obese.
4999	0	a	Ears, nose, and throat are clear.
5000	0	a	There are no cranial bruits.
5001	0	a	The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.
5002	0	a	There are wheezes bilaterally.
5003	0	a	The heart is regular with no murmur.
5004	0	a	The abdomen is benign.
5005	0	a	The extremities are normal.
5006	0	a	There is general psychomotor slowing.
5007	0	a	She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.
5008	0	a	She is oriented to place.
5009	0	a	She is inattentive.
5010	0	a	She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.
5011	0	a	She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.
5012	0	a	There is no aphasia.
5013	0	a	She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.
5014	0	a	The visual fields are full.
5015	0	a	The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.
5016	0	a	The fundi are poorly visualized.
5017	0	a	.
5018	0	a	The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.
5019	0	a	Facial sensation is intact.
5020	0	a	Facial power is normal and symmetric.
5021	0	a	Hearing is grossly intact.
5022	0	a	Weber and Rinne tests are normal.
5023	0	a	The palate elevates normal.
5024	0	a	Gag is present.
5025	0	a	The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.
5026	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
5027	0	a	Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.
5028	0	a	There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.
5029	0	a	Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.
5030	0	a	Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.
5031	0	a	Plantar responses are flexor.
5032	0	a	Coordination is intact.
5033	0	a	Romberg is negative.
5034	0	a	Gait and station are normal.
5035	0	a	Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
5036	0	a	Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
5037	0	a	I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.
5038	0	a	She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
5039	0	a	With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.
5040	0	a	I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
5041	0	a	Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.
5042	0	a	If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.
5043	0	a	Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
5044	0	a	These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
5045	0	a	She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.
5046	0	a	I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
5047	0	a	She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
5048	0	a	I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.
5049	0	a	Thank you for this consultation.
5050	0	a	Sincerely,
