109	0	a	HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.
110	0	a	He is status post TURP by Dr. 
111	0	a	Nixon.
112	0	a	He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
113	0	a	thinks that this should get better.
114	0	a	We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
115	0	a	range.
116	0	a	We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
117	0	a	that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
118	0	a	dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.
119	0	a	He has remained on digoxin status 
120	0	a	post his myocardial infarction.
121	0	a	We want to recheck his cholesterol today.
122	0	a	We also have been concerned 
123	0	a	that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
124	0	a	about his wife's situation with breast cancer.
125	0	a	We had a long discussion 
126	0	a	about this.
127	0	a	Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.
128	1	a	His blood pressure was 178/80.
129	0	a	The follow-up was 170/80.
130	0	a	His neck was 
131	0	a	supple.
132	0	a	Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.
133	0	a	Cardiac 
134	0	a	exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
135	0	a	Abdomen 
136	0	a	was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.
137	0	a	Extremities were 
138	0	a	clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
139	0	a	Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
140	0	a	negative.
141	0	a	Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.
142	0	a	Platelets were within normal 
143	0	a	limits.
144	0	a	White count is 8.3.
145	0	a	Digoxin is 0.9.
146	0	a	Lytes are within normal 
147	0	a	Assessment and Plan:
148	0	a	1.
149	0	a	Status post TURP.
150	0	a	He appears to be recovering well.
151	0	a	He has had 
152	0	a	     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
153	0	a	2.
154	0	a	Thrombocytopenia.
155	0	a	This was very relative.
156	0	a	It now appears to have 
157	0	a	     resolved.
158	0	a	3.
159	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
160	0	a	As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
161	0	a	     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.
162	0	a	At 
163	0	a	     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
164	0	a	     Lasix.
165	0	a	However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
166	0	a	     treatment with anti-anginals.
167	0	a	4.
168	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
169	0	a	This has been well-controlled recently.
170	0	a	His 
171	0	a	     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
172	0	a	5.
173	0	a	Depression.
174	0	a	He continues on Ambien.
175	0	a	He has some discretion about 
176	0	a	     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
177	0	a	     uncertainty resolved.

189	0	a	His last hemoglobin A1c six months ago was 6.50.

218	0	a	Check EPO level, follow CBC.
219	0	a	11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.
220	0	a	Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.

333	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
334	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
335	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
336	0	a	Hypercoag w/u
337	0	a	Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD
338	0	a	Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

348	0	a	CC: SOB, DOE x 5 days
349	2	a	HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.
350	0	a	Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.
351	0	a	He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.
352	0	a	Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.
353	0	a	His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.
354	0	a	He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.
355	0	a	The Pt sleeps on one pillow.
356	0	a	During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.
357	0	a	These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.
358	0	a	Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.
359	0	a	He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.
360	0	a	The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.
361	0	a	On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.
362	0	a	On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.
363	0	a	He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.
364	1	a	At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.
365	0	a	The Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L/min.
366	1	a	At NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L
367	0	a	The Pt received ASA 325mg PO.
368	0	a	Since receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.
369	0	a	The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).
370	0	a	He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds.

489	2	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.
490	0	a	PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.
491	0	a	Although, there were no 
492	0	a	CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.
493	0	a	Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.
494	0	a	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this.
495	0	a	However, Pt 
496	0	a	has not had any acute Sx while on the floor.
497	0	a	PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.
498	0	a	Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 
499	0	a	and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.
500	0	a	"1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic."
501	0	a	PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.
502	0	a	The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.
503	0	a	PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.
504	0	a	Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.
505	0	a	Will consider the addition of spironolactone.
506	0	a	Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.
507	0	a	Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.
508	0	a	Monitor UOP for kidney functions.
509	0	a	Monitor EKG for any changes.
510	0	a	Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE.
511	2	a	"2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today."
512	0	a	Will also be treated using meds for CHF.
513	0	a	"3)	DM - Sugars elevated."
514	0	a	Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.
515	0	a	"4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable."
516	0	a	Cont home medication of Lipitor.
517	0	a	"5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet."
518	0	a	Consider a diabetic diet as well.
519	0	a	"6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized."

522	0	a	12/10/94 Intern addendum:
523	0	a	Patient seen and examined with med student above.
524	0	a	Agree with overall assessment above.
525	0	a	Briefly:
526	2	a	This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.
527	0	a	DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.
528	0	a	Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
529	0	a	Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.
530	0	a	Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.
531	0	a	CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.
532	0	a	Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.
533	0	a	Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.
534	0	a	D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

545	0	a	Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis
546	0	a	HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22.
547	0	a	Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080.
548	0	a	Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes.
549	0	a	Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.
550	0	a	After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid.
551	0	a	HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081.
552	0	a	On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting.
553	0	a	Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her.
554	0	a	Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID.
555	0	a	Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease.
556	0	a	Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial.
557	0	a	She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
558	0	a	She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management.
559	0	a	On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID.

649	0	a	Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition.
650	0	a	Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20.
651	0	a	Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.
652	0	a	Abdominal pain can be multifactorial.
653	0	a	I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease.
654	0	a	With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility.
655	0	a	Recommendations: 
656	0	a	"1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility."
657	0	a	a.
658	0	a	Would not hold long acting insulin.
659	0	a	Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO
660	0	a	b.
661	0	a	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started.
662	0	a	If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.
663	0	a	"c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:"
664	0	a	"i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units."
665	0	a	"d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner."
666	0	a	Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
667	0	a	She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
668	0	a	"e.	No metformin for now given GI upset."
669	0	a	"2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace."
670	0	a	"3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac."
671	0	a	Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina.
672	0	a	Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
673	0	a	I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.
674	0	a	"4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response."
675	0	a	Thank you for the consult.
676	0	a	We will follow with you.
677	0	a	Please call with any questions.

832	2	a	"	This is a 79 year old woman with past medical history of DM-2, chronic immunosuppresion (steroid use), RA, HTN, h/o leg ulcers, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, who presents with a 1 week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema, without other symptomatic complaints, that has been resistant to po treatment"
833	0	a	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.
834	0	a	Other potential causes include osteo or DVT.
835	0	a	At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.
836	0	a	a.
837	0	a	Blood cultures
838	0	a	b.
839	0	a	Given her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45)

841	0	a	"d.	Warm compresses to increased circulation"
842	0	a	"e.	Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy"
843	0	a	"f.	If cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection."
844	0	a	Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT.
845	0	a	Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad.
846	0	a	She apparently had a negative PPD last year.
847	0	a	Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass
848	0	a	Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy

981	0	a	Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
982	0	a	Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
983	0	a	Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
984	0	a	HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.
985	0	a	This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.
986	0	a	He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
987	0	a	His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
988	0	a	A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
989	0	a	Homocysteine was normal.
990	0	a	Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
991	0	a	His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
992	0	a	Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
993	0	a	He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
994	0	a	A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
995	0	a	Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.
996	0	a	This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
997	0	a	The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.
998	0	a	I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
999	0	a	He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
1000	0	a	His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
1001	0	a	Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
1002	0	a	Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
1003	0	a	He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.
1004	0	a	He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.
1005	0	a	He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.
1006	0	a	His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
1007	0	a	These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.
1008	0	a	He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
1009	0	a	He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
1010	0	a	This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
1011	0	a	There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
1012	0	a	He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.
1013	0	a	The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
1014	0	a	He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
1015	0	a	He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.
1016	0	a	He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
1017	0	a	He is unable to work.
1018	0	a	His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
1019	0	a	He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
1020	0	a	His left arm remains paralyzed.
1021	0	a	He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
1022	0	a	He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
1023	0	a	He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
1024	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
1025	0	a	CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.
1026	0	a	On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
1027	0	a	His hair has now grown back.
1028	0	a	On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
1029	0	a	He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
1030	0	a	Eye contact is good.
1031	0	a	On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
1032	0	a	There is a left visual field deficit.
1033	0	a	The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
1034	0	a	The tongue protrudes in the midline.
1035	0	a	The left arm is completely plegic.
1036	0	a	The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
1037	0	a	There is left-sided sensory extinction.
1038	0	a	Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
1039	0	a	Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
1040	0	a	We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
1041	0	a	Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
1042	0	a	I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
1043	0	a	There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
1044	0	a	Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
1045	0	a	Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.
1046	0	a	Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
1047	0	a	I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
1048	0	a	We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
1049	0	a	If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.
1050	0	a	If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
1051	0	a	I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
1052	0	a	There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
1053	0	a	There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
1054	0	a	The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
1055	0	a	The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.
1056	0	a	I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
1057	0	a	We will keep an eye on this over time.
1058	0	a	No other changes are indicated at the moment.
1059	0	a	I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

1167	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
1168	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67 year-old male was seen in
1169	0	a	transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively
1170	0	a	worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated
1171	0	a	with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday.
1172	0	a	He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,
1173	0	a	progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal
1174	0	a	exertion.
1175	0	a	He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which
1176	0	a	did radiate to his left shoulder.
1177	0	a	This seemed to resolve
1178	0	a	spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind
1179	0	a	of exertion at all.
1180	0	a	The shortness of breath was exclusively
1181	0	a	exertional.
1182	0	a	He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
1183	0	a	presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.
1184	0	a	No fevers.
1185	0	a	He does have a
1186	0	a	slight cough that is nonproductive.
1187	0	a	He was seen at a local
1188	0	a	Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as
1189	0	a	well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states
1190	0	a	he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.
1191	0	a	He was
1192	0	a	cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his
1193	0	a	cardiologist at SAH.
1194	0	a	Additionally, at the outside Emergency
1195	0	a	Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,
1196	0	a	but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.
1197	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally
1198	0	a	controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter.
1199	0	a	He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.
1200	0	a	SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of
1201	0	a	smoking.
1202	0	a	REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,
1203	0	a	otherwise negative.
1204	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,
1205	0	a	glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.
1206	0	a	ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.
1207	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate
1208	1	a	20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
1209	0	a	HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.
1210	0	a	Pleasant, calm.
1211	0	a	Neck is
1212	0	a	supple.
1213	0	a	Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for
1214	0	a	scattered rales in the left lower lung field.
1215	0	a	Cardiovascular: 
1216	0	a	Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
1217	0	a	Abdomen is soft and
1218	0	a	nontender.
1219	0	a	Skin is intact, warm, and dry.
1220	0	a	Extremities:  He has
1221	0	a	got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is
1222	0	a	symmetric.
1223	0	a	Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities
1224	0	a	equally.
1225	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave
1226	0	a	progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.
1227	0	a	Chest x-ray
1228	0	a	shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural
1229	0	a	effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild
1230	0	a	pulmonary edema.
1231	0	a	Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with
1232	0	a	creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.
1233	0	a	BNP is still pending.
1234	0	a	INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on
1235	0	a	Coumadin.
1236	0	a	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency
1237	0	a	Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2
1238	0	a	liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic
1239	0	a	improvement in his dyspnea.
1240	0	a	He has no further episodes of chest
1241	0	a	pain or pressure.
1242	0	a	I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,
1243	0	a	the SAH cardiologist on-call.
1244	0	a	I believe this patient has CHF
1245	0	a	exacerbation.
1246	0	a	He also was recently cardioverted, which ____
1247	0	a	explain his troponin elevation.
1248	0	a	Additionally, his CHF
1249	0	a	exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I
1250	0	a	doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.
1251	0	a	At this point,
1252	0	a	the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on
1253	0	a	We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at
1254	0	a	this time.
1255	0	a	However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will
1256	0	a	be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for
1257	0	a	further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart
1258	0	a	failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.
1259	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin
1260	0	a	elevation, and diabetes.
1261	0	a	DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

1292	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as
1293	0	a	documented.
1294	0	a	The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.
1295	0	a	Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted
1296	1	a	at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.
1297	0	a	Physical exam
1298	0	a	reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with
1299	0	a	accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.
1300	0	a	She has rales

1305	0	a	Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.
1306	0	a	On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual
1307	0	a	nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.
1308	0	a	She is known to make urine, a
1309	0	a	Foley catheter was placed immediately.
1310	0	a	IV access was
1311	0	a	established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics.
1312	0	a	Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.
1313	0	a	On
1314	0	a	BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.
1315	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit
1316	0	a	of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.
1317	0	a	BNP was noted at
1318	0	a	700.
1319	0	a	Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was
1320	0	a	less than assay.

1322	0	a	of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.
1323	0	a	Urinalysis
1324	0	a	was negative and urine HCG was negative.
1325	0	a	EKG was sinus
1326	0	a	tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for
1327	0	a	rate-related ischemia.
1328	0	a	There were no prior EKGs available.
1329	0	a	Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.
1330	0	a	The Nephrology fellow covering
1331	0	a	hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate
1332	0	a	hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.
1333	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and
1334	0	a	CHF.
1335	0	a	ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is
1336	0	a	likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary
1337	0	a	edema and subsequent symptomatology.
1338	0	a	Given the current regimen,

1361	2	a	   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.
1362	0	a	To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.
1363	0	a	They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.
1364	0	a	He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes.
1365	0	a	These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.
1366	0	a	His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.
1367	0	a	A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.
1368	0	a	The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.
1369	0	a	During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.
1370	0	a	He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.
1371	0	a	Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks.
1372	0	a	Today, he presents with no acute complaints.
1373	0	a	He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.
1374	0	a	He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.
1375	0	a	His claudication is at his baseline.
1376	0	a	"He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs."
1377	0	a	He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.
1378	0	a	Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

1599	0	a	Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
1600	0	a	Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D.
1601	0	a	DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.
1602	0	a	HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.
1603	0	a	"The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand."
1604	0	a	This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
1605	0	a	Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
1606	0	a	He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.
1607	0	a	Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
1608	0	a	He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
1609	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.
1610	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.
1611	0	a	ALLERGIES:  None.
1612	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.
1613	0	a	Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
1614	0	a	There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
1615	0	a	very weak opponens.
1616	0	a	He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.
1617	0	a	His interossei and extensors are full.
1618	0	a	Sensation is intact throughout.
1619	0	a	EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.
1620	0	a	IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
1621	0	a	At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
1622	0	a	Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
1623	0	a	possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
1624	0	a	We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
1625	0	a	We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
1626	0	a	We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

2480	0	a	MRN:26649180
2481	0	a	Dear Dr. Short:
2482	0	a	Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr.
2483	0	a	Craft for the 
2484	0	a	possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
2485	0	a	As you know, he 
2486	0	a	is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
2487	0	a	history for a rheumatological disease.
2488	0	a	His past medical history, 
2489	0	a	briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
2490	0	a	time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
2491	0	a	he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
2492	0	a	characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
2493	0	a	stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.
2494	0	a	All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
2495	0	a	He was 
2496	0	a	treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
2497	0	a	that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
2498	0	a	symptoms and seizures went away.
2499	0	a	Since that time, he has had a 
2500	0	a	recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
2501	0	a	neck, pressure within his head.
2502	0	a	He considers himself to have 
2503	0	a	vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
2504	0	a	numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
2505	0	a	salivation and increased appetite.
2506	0	a	In describing his headache, he 
2507	0	a	noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
2508	0	a	has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
2509	0	a	quality.
2510	0	a	It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
2511	0	a	associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.
2512	0	a	There is no 
2513	0	a	family history of migraines as well.
2514	0	a	Also during his headache 
2515	0	a	events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
2516	0	a	nausea or vomiting.
2517	0	a	Past medical history:  As per above.
2518	0	a	Medicval issues include 
2519	0	a	bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
2520	0	a	gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
2521	0	a	migraine headaches.
2522	0	a	His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
2523	2	a	chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n.
2524	0	a	and 
2525	0	a	prednisone p.r.n.
2526	0	a	He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.
2527	0	a	There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
2528	0	a	use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
2529	0	a	remission.
2530	0	a	3-16-14
2531	0	a	Page 2
2532	0	a	Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
2533	0	a	mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.
2534	0	a	Social history:  He is a former stage manager.
2535	0	a	Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.
2536	0	a	Attention 
2537	0	a	was normal.
2538	0	a	Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
2539	0	a	errors.
2540	0	a	There is no memory deficit or agnosia.
2541	0	a	The patient gave 
2542	0	a	a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
2543	0	a	status testing was performed.
2544	0	a	Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
2545	0	a	fields were full.
2546	0	a	Disks were sharp.
2547	0	a	Fundus was clear.
2548	0	a	Extraocular movements were intact.
2549	0	a	There was no nystagmus.
2550	0	a	He 
2551	0	a	had normal facial sensation and symmetry.
2552	0	a	Hearing was grossly 
2553	0	a	normal.
2554	0	a	Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.
2555	0	a	Motor examination 
2556	0	a	revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.
2557	0	a	Deep tendon 
2558	0	a	reflexes were symmetrical.
2559	0	a	There was no upper motor neuron sign.
2560	0	a	Coordination and gait were normal.
2561	0	a	Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
2562	0	a	of lupus in the past.
2563	0	a	His recent blood work shows that his 
2564	0	a	double-stranded DNA was negative.
2565	0	a	Taking into consideration his 
2566	0	a	current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
2567	0	a	evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
2568	0	a	disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
2569	0	a	central nervous system vasculitis.
2570	0	a	He was told that he is at a 
2571	0	a	high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
2572	0	a	pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.
2573	0	a	If it is 
2574	0	a	possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
2575	0	a	a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
2576	0	a	also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d.
2577	0	a	for primary prevention 
2578	0	a	of heart disease.
2579	0	a	He was informed that it is possible that there 
2580	0	a	is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
2581	0	a	hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
2582	0	a	symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
2583	0	a	not clear.
2584	0	a	Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.
2585	0	a	Sincerely, 
2586	0	a	Clarence K. Hart, M.D.

3633	0	a	No acute intracranial process.
3634	0	a	Head MRI/MRA: pending
3635	2	a	Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.
3636	0	a	Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.
3637	0	a	Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.
3638	0	a	She has no face or leg weakness.
3639	0	a	Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.
3640	0	a	However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.
3641	0	a	Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.
3642	0	a	Recommendations:
3643	0	a	-Head and neck MRI/MRA
3644	0	a	-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
3645	0	a	-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
3646	0	a	-Continue statin.
3647	0	a	-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

3718	0	a	HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
3719	2	a	diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
3720	0	a	checkup.
3721	0	a	Patient appears to be doing fine.
3722	0	a	She has been compliant with her 
3723	0	a	antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
3724	0	a	hydrochlorothiazide.
3725	0	a	Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
3726	0	a	approximately 15 to 20 pounds.
3727	0	a	She has been exercising on a daily basis 
3728	0	a	and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
3729	0	a	beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
3730	0	a	was 120/80 in both arms.
3731	0	a	The patient was complaining of some ankle 
3732	0	a	swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
3733	0	a	on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
3734	0	a	admission.
3735	0	a	I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
3736	0	a	I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
3737	0	a	symptoms over the next few days.
3738	0	a	The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
3739	0	a	chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065.
3740	0	a	We 
3741	0	a	have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
3742	0	a	rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises.
3743	0	a	The 
3744	0	a	patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
3745	0	a	services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain.
3746	0	a	Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming.
3747	0	a	Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
3748	0	a	ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
3749	0	a	agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
3750	0	a	either a mammogram or a Pap smear.
3751	0	a	She complains that she does not have 
3752	0	a	faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
3753	0	a	to and does not want to have done.
3754	0	a	I attempted to discuss the need and why 
3755	0	a	it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
3756	0	a	this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
3757	0	a	refuses either of the two examinations.

4440	0	a	He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.
4441	0	a	He states that his breathing has been good.
4442	0	a	He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.
4443	0	a	He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.
4444	0	a	A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.
4445	0	a	He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.
4446	0	a	He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.
4447	2	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.
4448	0	a	MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.
4449	0	a	ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.
4450	1	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.
4451	0	a	In general, he is in no acute distress.

4459	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
4460	0	a	The extremities show no edema.
4461	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
4462	0	a	1.
4463	0	a	Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.
4464	0	a	He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.
4465	0	a	He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
4466	0	a	2.
4467	0	a	BPH.
4468	0	a	We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
4469	0	a	Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
4470	0	a	3.
4471	0	a	Hypertension.
4472	0	a	This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.
4473	0	a	If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
4474	0	a	4.
4475	0	a	COPD.
4476	0	a	Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.
4477	0	a	He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
4478	0	a	5.
4479	0	a	Elevated cholesterol.
4480	0	a	His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
4481	0	a	If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
4482	0	a	6.
4483	0	a	Abnormal liver function tests.
4484	0	a	These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
4485	0	a	It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.
4486	0	a	Follow up with me is in one month.

4788	0	a	   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.
4789	0	a	From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.
4790	0	a	I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.
4791	0	a	She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).
4792	0	a	She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.
4793	1	a	1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.
4794	2	a	NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.
4795	0	a	Will discuss with Drs.
4796	0	a	Harper/Kumar tomorrow.
4797	0	a	Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.
4798	0	a	She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
4799	0	a	2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.
4800	0	a	She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
4801	0	a	3) Secondary prevention as above
4802	0	a	4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.
4803	0	a	Follow sugars while in house
4804	0	a	5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

5164	0	a	ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.
5165	0	a	She is a 
5166	0	a	70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
5167	0	a	fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
5168	0	a	Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
5169	0	a	history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
5170	0	a	diminution after the surgery.
5171	0	a	MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
5172	0	a	Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
5173	0	a	20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.
5174	0	a	She is also 
5175	0	a	taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.
5176	0	a	The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.
5177	0	a	Her blood 
5178	1	a	pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
5179	0	a	been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
5180	0	a	150 all the way up to 450.
5181	0	a	We have made some adjustments recently in 
5182	0	a	her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
5183	0	a	Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
5184	0	a	been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
5185	0	a	medicines without problems.
5186	0	a	She does note that she is having some pain 
5187	0	a	down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
5188	0	a	The 
5189	0	a	patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
5190	0	a	wanes over time.
5191	0	a	The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
5192	0	a	this.
5193	0	a	The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
5194	0	a	fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
5195	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
5196	0	a	walks with a walker today.
5197	1	a	Blood pressure: 144/76.
5198	0	a	Pulse: 78 and 
5199	0	a	regular.
5200	0	a	Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
5201	0	a	Her heart 
5202	0	a	is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
5203	0	a	She has got a regular rate and 
5204	0	a	rhythm today.
5205	0	a	Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
5206	0	a	She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
5207	0	a	She has got no lower extremity 
5208	0	a	edema.
5209	0	a	Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
5210	0	a	into the sciatic notch on the left side.
5211	0	a	She has got otherwise joints 
5212	0	a	that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
5213	0	a	There 
5214	0	a	is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
5215	0	a	Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
5216	0	a	monitoring.
5217	0	a	My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
5218	0	a	I will 
5219	0	a	not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
5220	0	a	I 
5221	0	a	suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
5222	0	a	would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
5223	0	a	remits on it's own.
5224	0	a	12 Weld St                             BIRD, TERRI
5225	0	a	PAGE 2
5226	0	a	Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
5227	0	a	last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
5228	0	a	She is 
5229	0	a	clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
5230	0	a	her being able to manage her own medications.
5231	0	a	I have discussed this 
5232	0	a	issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
5233	0	a	with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
5234	0	a	I will talk 
5235	0	a	to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
5236	0	a	his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
5237	0	a	without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
5238	0	a	finally in a more regular situation.
5239	0	a	We will try this over time and see 
5240	0	a	how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
5241	0	a	letting her drive on her own.

5368	0	a	Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant.
5369	0	a	Rule out 
5370	0	a	osteoporosis.
5371	0	a	HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
5372	0	a	diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.
5373	0	a	At 
5374	0	a	the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.
5375	0	a	Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
5376	0	a	but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
5377	0	a	approximately 26 weeks.
5378	0	a	At that point, he was believed to be in 
5379	0	a	remission and stayed in remission since then.
5380	0	a	In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
5381	0	a	presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.
5382	0	a	Subsequently he 
5383	0	a	was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
5384	0	a	that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
5385	0	a	six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.
5386	0	a	He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
5387	0	a	100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
5388	0	a	Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.
5389	0	a	The patient's 
5390	0	a	complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.
5391	0	a	There is 
5392	0	a	no peripheral neuropathy.
5393	0	a	There is no autonomic neuropathy.
5394	0	a	No retinal 
5395	0	a	disease.
5396	0	a	However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
5397	0	a	creatinine currently of 2.4.
5398	0	a	Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
5399	0	a	symptoms in the early 80s.
5400	0	a	By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
5401	0	a	severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
5402	0	a	2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
5403	0	a	infarctions.
5404	0	a	In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
5405	0	a	transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.
5406	0	a	Since 
5407	0	a	that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
5408	0	a	with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
5409	0	a	degree of symptoms.
5410	0	a	The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
5411	0	a	day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.
5412	0	a	Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
5413	0	a	twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
5414	0	a	mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.
5415	0	a	Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
5416	0	a	was from a trauma some years ago.
5417	0	a	Other past medical history includes 
5418	0	a	history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

5498	0	a	His CBC 
5499	0	a	revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a

5501	0	a	Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
5502	0	a	multiple medical problems.
5503	0	a	The one's most pertinent to us currently are 
5504	0	a	007 Lunar Lane                           61248040
5505	0	a	Page 3
5506	0	a	the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
5507	0	a	osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
5508	0	a	The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
5509	0	a	is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
5510	0	a	chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.
5511	0	a	The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
5512	0	a	height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
5513	0	a	be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
5514	0	a	patients.
5515	0	a	However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
5516	0	a	this makes sense.
5517	0	a	We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
5518	0	a	his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
5519	0	a	reasons.
5520	0	a	We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
5521	0	a	renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
5522	0	a	do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
5523	0	a	to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
5524	0	a	vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.
5525	0	a	We would be a little 
5526	0	a	reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
5527	0	a	without more information about this patient.
5528	0	a	The patient's diabetes 
5529	0	a	seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
5530	0	a	fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
5531	0	a	don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.
5532	0	a	Given the fact that it sounds like 
5533	0	a	he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
5534	0	a	the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
5535	0	a	situation.
5536	0	a	Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to
