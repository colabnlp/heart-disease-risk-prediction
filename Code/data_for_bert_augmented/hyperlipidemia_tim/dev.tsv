859	0	a	Impression
860	0	a	My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W.
861	0	a	"She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother"" coverage"
862	0	a	Recommendation
863	0	a	My recommendations are:
864	0	a	1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO
865	0	a	2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO
866	0	a	3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

875	0	a	HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
876	0	a	who presents for routine follow up.
877	0	a	CURRENT ISSUES:
878	0	a	1.
879	0	a	Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
880	0	a	The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
881	0	a	     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.
882	0	a	We discussed 
883	0	a	     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
884	0	a	     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
885	0	a	     tighter control.
886	0	a	He states he has been following his finger 
887	0	a	     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this.
888	0	a	His 
889	0	a	     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
890	0	a	     regular.
891	0	a	At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
892	0	a	     regular at dinnertime.
893	0	a	He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
894	0	a	2.
895	3	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
896	0	a	Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
897	0	a	     rash to his simvastatin.
898	0	a	This resolved on the discontinuation of 
899	0	a	     the simvastatin.
900	2	a	Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
901	0	a	     January, 2067.
902	0	a	He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
903	0	a	     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
904	0	a	     fats.
905	0	a	3.
906	0	a	Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
907	0	a	The 
908	0	a	     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a

1222	0	a	She must stop at the top to rest.
1223	0	a	She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema.
1224	0	a	A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm.
1225	0	a	There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle.
1226	0	a	A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%.
1227	0	a	A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis.
1228	0	a	Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm.
1229	0	a	Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.
1230	0	a	She was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
1231	0	a	She presents today for preoperative testing and evaluation.
1232	0	a	She currently notes dyspnea on exertion with two flights of stairs.

1396	0	a	     MRN: 89276954
1397	0	a	Dear Usha:
1398	0	a	I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up
1399	0	a	cardiovascular examination.
1400	0	a	She has been reasonably stable since
1401	0	a	I saw her last in July.
1402	0	a	She has had several episodes of chest
1403	0	a	discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite
1404	0	a	transient.
1405	0	a	The frequency has been less than one time per month.
1406	0	a	The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping
1407	0	a	mall.
1408	0	a	She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
1409	0	a	She has
1410	0	a	not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
1411	0	a	She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying
1412	0	a	transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.
1413	0	a	She
1414	0	a	denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip
1415	0	a	pain with walking.
1416	0	a	She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
1417	0	a	She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.
1418	0	a	Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o.
1419	0	a	b.i.d.,
1420	0	a	nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o.
1421	0	a	q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.

1427	0	a	week, furosemide 20 mg p.o.
1428	0	a	q.d.
1429	0	a	p.r.n., quinine sulfate 324 mg
1430	0	a	p.o.

1434	0	a	q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.
1435	0	a	and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
1436	0	a	p.r.n.
1437	0	a	On examination she appears well.
1438	0	a	Weight is 142 pounds.
1439	0	a	Blood
1440	0	a	pressure is 140/60.
1441	0	a	Heart rate is 50 and regular.
1442	0	a	Neck veins
1443	0	a	are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.
1444	0	a	There are bilateral carotid
1445	0	a	bruits.
1446	0	a	Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to
1447	0	a	auscultation.
1448	0	a	On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth
1449	0	a	intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
1450	0	a	There is a 1+ left
1451	0	a	ventricular lift.
1452	0	a	The first heart sound is normal.
1453	0	a	The second 
1454	0	a	Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954
1455	0	a	November 07, 2086              -2-
1456	0	a	is split physiologically.
1457	0	a	There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic
1458	0	a	murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along
1459	0	a	the left sternal border.
1460	0	a	There is a fourth heart sound at the
1461	0	a	apex.
1462	0	a	Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no
1463	0	a	hepatosplenomegaly.
1464	0	a	Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral
1465	0	a	femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft
1466	0	a	pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis
1467	0	a	pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal
1468	0	a	pulses.
1469	0	a	Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
1470	0	a	AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral
1471	0	a	myocardial infarction.
1472	0	a	There has been no diagnostic change since
1473	0	a	July 18, 2086.
1474	0	a	Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,
1475	0	a	2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
1476	0	a	and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
1477	0	a	The
1478	0	a	velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
1479	0	a	calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
1480	0	a	2086.
1481	0	a	Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left
1482	0	a	femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
1483	0	a	velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
1484	0	a	thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.
1485	0	a	The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent
1486	0	a	with no evidence of significant stenoses.
1487	0	a	In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:
1488	0	a	1.
1489	0	a	Coronary artery disease.
1490	0	a	Status post coronary artery bypass
1491	0	a	surgery.
1492	0	a	LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and
1493	0	a	posterolateral left ventricular branch.
1494	0	a	She has occasional and
1495	0	a	very transient episodes of angina.
1496	0	a	I have suggested continuing
1497	0	a	her current medical regimen.
1498	0	a	As noted previously, I prefer to
1499	0	a	manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.
1500	0	a	2.
1501	0	a	Carotid artery disease.
1502	0	a	She is asymptomatic.
1503	0	a	I recommend
1504	0	a	periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.
1505	0	a	3.
1506	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease.
1507	0	a	Both grafts are patent but the
1508	0	a	left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have
1509	0	a	a significant stenosis.
1510	0	a	I have asked her to discuss this finding
1511	0	a	with you further.
1512	0	a	November 07, 2086              -3-
1513	0	a	4.
1514	3	a	Hypercholesterolemia.

1519	0	a	I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably

2235	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 
2236	0	a	reasonably comfortable.
2237	0	a	She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 
2238	0	a	which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
2239	0	a	Her blood pressure in 
2240	0	a	the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.
2241	0	a	Her chest has a few basal 
2242	0	a	crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
2243	0	a	JVP fills below the 
2244	0	a	sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 
2245	0	a	sternal border.
2246	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
2247	0	a	There is no renal tenderness.
2248	0	a	Extremities have no edema.
2249	0	a	IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
2250	0	a	10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
2251	0	a	The 
2252	0	a	proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 
2253	0	a	this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
2254	0	a	It would be useful to know 
2255	0	a	from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
2256	0	a	It is, of course, also 
2257	0	a	possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
2258	0	a	Their symmetry and 
2259	0	a	the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
2260	0	a	The ACE 
2261	0	a	inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
2262	0	a	creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
2263	0	a	Her loss of appetite and 
2264	0	a	nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
2265	0	a	RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 
2266	0	a	dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 
2267	0	a	hyperlipidemia.
2268	0	a	This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
2269	0	a	It think it 
2270	0	a	would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
2271	0	a	perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
2272	0	a	less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
2273	0	a	If, of course, shortness of 
2274	0	a	breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 
2275	0	a	reasonable.
2276	0	a	It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 
2277	0	a	metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
2278	0	a	requirement for Lasix.
2279	0	a	If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
2280	0	a	diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 
2281	0	a	be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
2282	0	a	Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
2283	0	a	from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
2284	0	a	Aranesp).
2285	0	a	PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 
2286	0	a	help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
2287	0	a	If so, the 
2288	0	a	measures proposed would be appropriate.
2289	0	a	We discussed the eventual probable 
2290	0	a	need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
2291	0	a	It would 
2292	0	a	be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
2293	0	a	floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.
2294	0	a	We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 
2295	0	a	a need for it arises.
2296	0	a	I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 
2297	0	a	done in the next few months.
2298	0	a	This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
2299	0	a	or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
2300	0	a	I will, of course, help with any of 
2301	0	a	these measures as necessary.
2302	0	a	Xander Xie, M.D.
2303	0	a	Wanda
2304	0	a	Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
2305	0	a	This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.
2306	0	a	I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
2307	0	a	If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

2827	0	a	MRN:      7194334
2828	0	a	This patient is here for a follow-up.
2829	0	a	She was seen with a very complete evaluation 
2830	0	a	by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.
2831	0	a	She submitted a
2832	0	a	urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her
2833	0	a	urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.
2834	0	a	A fair amount retained
2835	0	a	as postvoid residual.
2836	0	a	Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with
2837	0	a	resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor
2838	0	a	and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
2839	0	a	She
2840	0	a	has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent
2841	0	a	infections.
2842	0	a	She is most concerned about having cancer.
2843	0	a	She is scheduled to see Dr.
2844	0	a	Quezada March 24th.
2845	0	a	The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
2846	0	a	been issues going around the housing projects.
2847	0	a	A 14-year-old girl was raped and
2848	0	a	one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
2849	0	a	She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
2850	0	a	She did not file a
2851	0	a	police report.
2852	0	a	As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
2853	0	a	reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix
2854	0	a	approximately one week ago.
2855	0	a	She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet
2856	0	a	sporadically but not on a regular basis.
2857	0	a	She denies any chest pressure or
2858	0	a	palpitations.
2859	0	a	She denies any shortness of breath.
2860	0	a	She denies any problems with
2861	0	a	pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.
2862	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.
2863	0	a	Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
2864	0	a	No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
2865	0	a	UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.
2866	0	a	Her
2867	0	a	ankle reveals trace edema on the left.
2868	0	a	Her right extremity is warm to palpation.
2869	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
2870	0	a	(1)  Hypertension.
2871	0	a	Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
2872	0	a	This
2873	0	a	     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.
2874	0	a	I have
2875	0	a	     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d.
2876	0	a	on a regular
2877	0	a	     basis.
2878	0	a	(2)  Anxiety.
2879	0	a	I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try
2880	0	a	     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.
2881	0	a	(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
2882	0	a	She had a urine culture submitted today.
2883	0	a	She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.
2884	0	a	     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
2885	0	a	I attempted to
2886	0	a	     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current
2887	0	a	     recurrent infections.
2888	0	a	It is more likely due to her cystocele.
2889	0	a	(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.
2890	0	a	This appears stable.
2891	0	a	She remains off the
2892	0	a	     cigarettes.
2893	0	a	(5)  ASCVD.
2894	0	a	She remains without symptoms.
2895	0	a	(6)  GERD.
2896	0	a	She remains on the Prilosec.
2897	3	a	(7)  Hyperlipidemia.
2898	0	a	She remains on Lipitor.
2899	0	a	She should have a repeat
2900	0	a	     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.
2901	0	a	(8)  Borderline high sugar.
2902	0	a	The patient should also have this rechecked with the
2903	0	a	     new physician in the fall.

3007	0	a	Dear Nurse Rivas, 
3008	0	a	We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
3009	0	a	The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
3010	2	a	Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.
3011	0	a	She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.
3012	0	a	She was last seen here in December 2091.
3013	0	a	Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.
3014	0	a	Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
3015	0	a	However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.
3016	0	a	Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.
3017	0	a	She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.
3018	0	a	She denies any recent seizures.
3019	0	a	After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

3067	0	a	Assessment and Recommendations:
3068	2	a	60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.
3069	0	a	Her clinical examination remains intact.
3070	0	a	She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.
3071	0	a	Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.
3072	0	a	Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.
3073	0	a	Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.
3074	0	a	If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).
3075	0	a	After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.
3076	0	a	She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.
3077	0	a	We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.
3078	0	a	The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
3079	0	a	(It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
3080	0	a	Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.
3081	0	a	Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.
3082	0	a	Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam.
3083	0	a	Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
3084	0	a	Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
3085	0	a	As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.

3603	0	a	ASSESSMENT
3604	0	a	33 y.o.
3605	0	a	Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.
3606	2	a	Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.
3607	0	a	All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.
3608	0	a	Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.
3609	0	a	His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.
3610	0	a	He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.
3611	0	a	His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.
3612	0	a	The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
3613	0	a	His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
3614	0	a	RECOMMENDATIONS:
3615	0	a	Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
3616	0	a	Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
3617	0	a	If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
3618	0	a	Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
3619	0	a	No concentrated sweets diet
3620	0	a	Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
3621	0	a	Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
3622	0	a	Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
3623	0	a	Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
3624	0	a	Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service
3625	0	a	Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.
