110	0	a	She did call this service this past weekend she

112	0	a	She called me this
113	0	a	morning, and I saw her immediately.
114	0	a	The pain has not gone
115	0	a	down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.

137	0	a	Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
138	0	a	think that she should be observed in the BH emergency

789	0	a	  MRN: 618-13-82-6
790	0	a	  Dear Dr. Yingling:
791	0	a	  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,
792	2	a	  for her problem of coronary ischemia.
793	0	a	As you know, Ms.
794	0	a	  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of
795	0	a	  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is
796	0	a	  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest
797	0	a	  tightness associated with exertion.
798	0	a	A stress MIBI SPECT
799	0	a	  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and
800	0	a	  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex
801	0	a	  distribution.
802	0	a	The details of the study include an exercise
803	0	a	  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and
804	0	a	  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from
805	0	a	  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and
806	0	a	  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a
807	0	a	  rate pressure product of 33,390).
808	0	a	The test was stopped due
809	3	a	  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.
810	0	a	EKG
811	0	a	  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and
812	0	a	  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.
813	0	a	Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her
814	0	a	  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and
815	0	a	  verapamil 240mg q.d.
816	0	a	A recent lipid panel demonstrated a
817	0	a	  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.
818	0	a	On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing
819	0	a	  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute
820	0	a	  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.
821	0	a	Jugular
822	0	a	  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.
823	0	a	Carotids
824	0	a	  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.
825	0	a	Chest
826	0	a	  examination was clear to auscultation.
827	0	a	Heart examination
828	0	a	  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split
829	0	a	  S2, no murmurs or rubs.
830	0	a	Abdominal examination was 
831	0	a	  Page 2
832	0	a	  unremarkable.
833	0	a	Peripheral examination demonstrated no
834	0	a	  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
835	0	a	EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
836	0	a	  EKG.
837	0	a	I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
838	0	a	  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
839	0	a	  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
840	3	a	  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
841	0	a	We reviewed the
842	0	a	  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
843	0	a	  angiography and possible angioplasty.
844	0	a	I made no solid
845	0	a	  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty
846	0	a	  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
847	0	a	  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
848	0	a	  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and
849	0	a	  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
850	0	a	  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
851	0	a	  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
852	0	a	  tolerance.
853	0	a	She and her husband are going to reflect on
854	0	a	  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the
855	0	a	  week.
856	0	a	If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography
857	0	a	  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately
858	0	a	  in Cardiology.
859	0	a	I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see
860	0	a	  her in the office.
861	0	a	Please do not hesitate to contact me if
862	0	a	  I can be of any further assistance.

875	0	a	Dear Dr.  Osuna:
876	0	a	  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.
877	1	a	As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.
878	1	a	He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.
879	0	a	His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.
880	0	a	He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.
881	0	a	Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.
882	0	a	He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.
883	0	a	He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.
884	0	a	He is no longer using a CPAP.
885	0	a	Current Medications:
886	0	a	  aspirin 325 mg qd
887	0	a	 Diovan 80 mg qd

915	0	a	No pulsatile masses
916	0	a	-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
917	0	a	He has trace pedal edema bilaterally
918	0	a	Procedures:
919	0	a	Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.
920	0	a	concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.
921	0	a	Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.
922	0	a	Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.
923	4	a	Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.
924	0	a	The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.
925	0	a	EKG:
926	1	a	    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.
927	0	a	Assessment and plan:
928	1	a	   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution.
929	0	a	There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique.
930	0	a	I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease.
931	0	a	Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm.
932	0	a	We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

1057	0	a	Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
1058	0	a	was positive.
1059	0	a	She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
1060	0	a	a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.
1061	0	a	She had 1mm 
1062	4	a	and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
1063	0	a	disease.
1064	0	a	She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
1065	0	a	vigorously, which is rapidly walking.
1066	0	a	She vehemently denies that she 
1067	0	a	has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
1068	0	a	We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
1069	0	a	have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
1070	0	a	interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
1071	0	a	PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.
1072	0	a	She 
1073	0	a	refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
1074	0	a	for taking it.
1075	0	a	She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
1076	0	a	on atenolol.
1077	0	a	Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.
1078	0	a	We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.
1079	0	a	I will continue to work 
1080	0	a	with her strenuously on risk factor modification.
1081	0	a	Her other risk 
1082	0	a	factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
1083	0	a	her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.
1084	0	a	Her 
1085	0	a	diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
1086	0	a	her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
1087	0	a	She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
1088	0	a	if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
1089	0	a	hospital.

1657	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
1658	0	a	She has been doing very well.
1659	0	a	She has been exercising and has lost from 
1660	0	a	200 to 170 pounds.
1661	0	a	She is feeling very well.
1662	0	a	Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.
1663	0	a	He did not find the 
1664	0	a	first ETT acceptable.
1665	4	a	The second ETT was grossly positive.
1666	0	a	As a result 
1667	0	a	of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
1668	0	a	atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
1669	0	a	nitrate.
1670	0	a	She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
1671	0	a	pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
1672	0	a	She did have hyperlipidemia.
1673	0	a	We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
1674	0	a	provided some control.
1675	0	a	However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
1676	0	a	is not an excellent ratio.
1677	0	a	Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
1678	0	a	limits.
1679	0	a	She also has right shoulder lipoma.
1680	0	a	This has become apparent since she 
1681	0	a	lost so much weight.
1682	0	a	She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
1683	0	a	recommended Dr. Dawson.
1684	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
1685	0	a	120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.
1686	0	a	Neck is supple.
1687	0	a	There 
1688	0	a	is no lymphadenopathy.
1689	0	a	Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
1690	0	a	Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
1691	0	a	Abdomen is soft and nontender.
1692	0	a	There is no hepatosplenomegaly.
1693	0	a	Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.
1694	0	a	LABORATORY DATA:  None today.
1695	0	a	Page 2
1696	0	a	ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1697	0	a	1.
1698	2	a	CAD.
1699	0	a	We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.
1700	0	a	I also 
1701	0	a	gave her nitroglycerine.
1702	0	a	We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
1703	0	a	continue her atenolol.
1704	0	a	She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
1705	0	a	Premarin and Synthroid.
1706	0	a	2.
1707	0	a	Weight loss.
1708	0	a	She will continue to exercise.
1709	0	a	I suspect she is going 
1710	0	a	to lose more weight.
1711	0	a	This is excellent.
1712	0	a	3.
1713	2	a	Coronary artery disease.
1714	0	a	Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
1715	0	a	cardiac catheterization.
1716	0	a	It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
1717	0	a	this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
1718	0	a	She is going to 
1719	0	a	delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
1720	0	a	done on this variety of medical issues.

2047	0	a	CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pressure.
2048	0	a	Mr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by
2049	0	a	me.
2050	0	a	He is a transfer from an outside hospital to be admitted
2051	0	a	because of his chest pain.
2052	0	a	HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man who was
2053	0	a	loading some luggage in a car this morning at about 4:30 a.m.  At
2054	0	a	that time, he experienced acute onset of squeezing, chest pain,
2055	0	a	and chest pressure associated with shortness of breath.
2056	0	a	He
2057	0	a	described his pain as being very intense about 9/10, described
2058	0	a	heaviness across his chest and shortness of breath.
2059	0	a	He stated
2060	0	a	that while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse
2061	0	a	and since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature.
2062	0	a	was taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,
2063	0	a	and transferred here.
2064	0	a	He is currently pain free.
2065	0	a	At Oakridge State his troponin was negative.
2066	0	a	His CPK was
2067	0	a	negative.
2068	0	a	His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no
2069	0	a	acute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which
2070	0	a	correlates with our cardiogram here.
2071	0	a	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His history, however, is significant in
2072	0	a	that he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06/2093.
2073	0	a	At that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was
2074	0	a	30%, and left circumflex was also 30%.

2270	0	a	     MRN: 89276954
2271	0	a	Dear Usha:
2272	0	a	I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up
2273	0	a	cardiovascular examination.
2274	0	a	She has been reasonably stable since
2275	0	a	I saw her last in July.
2276	0	a	She has had several episodes of chest
2277	0	a	discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite
2278	0	a	transient.
2279	0	a	The frequency has been less than one time per month.
2280	0	a	The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping
2281	0	a	mall.
2282	0	a	She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
2283	0	a	She has
2284	0	a	not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
2285	0	a	She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying
2286	0	a	transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.
2287	0	a	She
2288	0	a	denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip
2289	0	a	pain with walking.
2290	0	a	She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
2291	0	a	She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.
2292	0	a	Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o.
2293	0	a	b.i.d.,
2294	0	a	nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o.
2295	0	a	q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.

2309	0	a	and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
2310	0	a	p.r.n.
2311	0	a	On examination she appears well.
2312	0	a	Weight is 142 pounds.
2313	0	a	Blood
2314	0	a	pressure is 140/60.
2315	0	a	Heart rate is 50 and regular.
2316	0	a	Neck veins
2317	0	a	are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.
2318	0	a	There are bilateral carotid
2319	0	a	bruits.
2320	0	a	Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to
2321	0	a	auscultation.
2322	0	a	On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth
2323	0	a	intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
2324	0	a	There is a 1+ left
2325	0	a	ventricular lift.
2326	0	a	The first heart sound is normal.
2327	0	a	The second 
2328	0	a	Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954
2329	0	a	November 07, 2086              -2-
2330	0	a	is split physiologically.
2331	0	a	There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic
2332	0	a	murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along
2333	0	a	the left sternal border.
2334	0	a	There is a fourth heart sound at the
2335	0	a	apex.
2336	0	a	Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no
2337	0	a	hepatosplenomegaly.
2338	0	a	Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral
2339	0	a	femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft
2340	0	a	pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis
2341	0	a	pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal
2342	0	a	pulses.
2343	0	a	Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
2344	0	a	AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral
2345	0	a	myocardial infarction.
2346	0	a	There has been no diagnostic change since
2347	0	a	July 18, 2086.
2348	0	a	Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,
2349	0	a	2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
2350	0	a	and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
2351	0	a	The
2352	0	a	velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
2353	0	a	calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
2354	0	a	2086.
2355	0	a	Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left
2356	0	a	femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
2357	0	a	velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
2358	0	a	thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086.
2359	0	a	The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent
2360	0	a	with no evidence of significant stenoses.
2361	0	a	In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:
2362	0	a	1.
2363	2	a	Coronary artery disease.
2364	0	a	Status post coronary artery bypass
2365	0	a	surgery.
2366	0	a	LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and
2367	0	a	posterolateral left ventricular branch.
2368	0	a	She has occasional and
2369	3	a	very transient episodes of angina.
2370	0	a	I have suggested continuing
2371	0	a	her current medical regimen.
2372	0	a	As noted previously, I prefer to
2373	0	a	manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.
2374	0	a	2.
2375	0	a	Carotid artery disease.
2376	0	a	She is asymptomatic.
2377	0	a	I recommend
2378	0	a	periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.
2379	0	a	3.
2380	0	a	Peripheral arterial disease.
2381	0	a	Both grafts are patent but the
2382	0	a	left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have
2383	0	a	a significant stenosis.
2384	0	a	I have asked her to discuss this finding
2385	0	a	with you further.
2386	0	a	November 07, 2086              -3-
2387	0	a	4.
2388	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.

2390	0	a	5.
2391	0	a	Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental
2392	0	a	procedures.
2393	0	a	I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably
2394	0	a	aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an

2567	0	a	Assessment/Plan:
2568	2	a	The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.
2569	0	a	His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis.
2570	0	a	He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.
2571	0	a	Plan:
2572	0	a	-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr
2573	0	a	-          Home meds
2574	0	a	-          NPO past midnight
2575	0	a	-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99

2610	0	a	Impression:
2611	0	a	Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
2612	0	a	Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
2613	0	a	Persistent DVT
2614	0	a	PFO with right to left shunt
2615	0	a	COPD
2616	0	a	Recs:
2617	0	a	Recommend retrievable IVC filter.
2618	0	a	Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
2619	0	a	Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
2620	0	a	Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
2621	0	a	Hypercoag w/u
2622	0	a	Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD

2663	0	a	although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
2664	0	a	it over the past two days.
2665	0	a	She denies any increasing polyuria, 
2666	0	a	polydipsia, polyphagia.
2667	0	a	Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
2668	0	a	of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
2669	0	a	the morning.
2670	0	a	I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
2671	0	a	being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
2672	0	a	that she has been taking them.
2673	0	a	It is not entirely clear to me whether 
2674	0	a	this is true or not.
2675	0	a	Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.
2676	0	a	She says 
2677	0	a	she is feeling a little bit better.
2678	0	a	She was recently started on 
2679	0	a	risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
2680	0	a	the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
2681	0	a	a month.
2682	0	a	She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
2683	0	a	She says overall 
2684	0	a	she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
2685	0	a	drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
2686	0	a	We again discussed the 
2687	0	a	importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
2688	3	a	Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
2689	0	a	after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
2690	0	a	frequency.
2691	0	a	She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
2692	0	a	rest.

2695	0	a	PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.
2696	0	a	Her 
2697	0	a	pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.
2698	0	a	Her weight today is 
2699	0	a	249lb.
2700	0	a	Her sclera are nonicteric.

2702	0	a	degrees.
2703	0	a	There are no carotid bruits.
2704	0	a	Her lungs are clear to 
2705	0	a	auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
2706	0	a	positive S1, S2.
2707	0	a	No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
2708	0	a	extremities are warm and without significant edema.
2709	0	a	Her finger stick 
2710	0	a	blood sugar in the office today was 331.
2711	0	a	ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
2712	0	a	problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.
2713	0	a	Diabetes.
2714	0	a	Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
2715	0	a	     essentially unchanged from six months prior.
2716	0	a	Finger stick in the 
2717	0	a	     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
2718	0	a	     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
2719	0	a	     over the past couple of months.
2720	0	a	In any event, she most likely need 
2721	0	a	     a higher dose of sulphonurea.
2722	0	a	We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
2723	0	a	     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
2724	0	a	     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.
2725	0	a	Her last urine microalbumin was negative.
2726	0	a	Hypercholesterolemia.
2727	0	a	When she returns to clinic in three months, 
2728	0	a	     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
2729	0	a	     Lipitor for approximately six months.
2730	0	a	Coronary disease.
2731	3	a	She is still having exertional chest pain.
2732	0	a	Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d.
2733	0	a	as she did have room to go 
2734	0	a	     with her pulse and blood pressure.
2735	0	a	I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
2736	0	a	     her psychiatrist and her counselor.
2737	0	a	Again, reinforced the 
2738	0	a	     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
2739	0	a	     again as I have in the past.
2740	0	a	She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
2741	0	a	     PPI and H2 blocker for now.
2742	0	a	I told her she should take the 
2743	0	a	     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.
2744	0	a	Health maintenance.
2745	0	a	She received a flu shot and she will return to 
2746	0	a	     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
2747	0	a	     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.
2748	0	a	Additionally, I 
2749	0	a	     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
2750	0	a	     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.
2751	0	a	I also stressed the

2753	0	a	Page 3
2754	0	a	     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.
2755	0	a	She says she is scheduled 
2756	0	a	     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
2757	0	a	     diabetic retinopathy.

3307	0	a	Dear Iva:
3308	1	a	Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.
3309	1	a	At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.
3310	1	a	On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.
3311	1	a	On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.
3312	0	a	"She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications."
3313	0	a	She has no shortness of breath.
3314	0	a	She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.
3315	0	a	She does get epigastric discomfort.
3316	2	a	Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.
3317	0	a	The review of systems is negative other than the above.
3318	0	a	On physical examination, she appears well.
3319	0	a	Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.
3320	0	a	HEENT:  Normal.
3321	0	a	The neck veins are not distended.
3322	0	a	The chest is clear.
3323	0	a	On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.
3324	0	a	Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.
3325	0	a	The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
3326	0	a	The skin has no rash.
3327	0	a	Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.
3328	0	a	I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.
3329	0	a	Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.
3330	0	a	"I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck."""
3331	0	a	I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.
3332	0	a	I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.
3333	0	a	I will plan to see her again in about four months.
3334	0	a	Best personal regards.
3335	0	a	Sincerely yours,

3355	0	a	       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.
3356	0	a	He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.
3357	0	a	He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081.
3358	0	a	He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects.
3359	0	a	Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.
3360	0	a	evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally
