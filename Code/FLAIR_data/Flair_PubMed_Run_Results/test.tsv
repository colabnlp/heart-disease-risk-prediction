Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.	['cad.event.before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.	['cad.event.before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Social History: She is married and has three children.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has no known drug allergies.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has never used tobacco.	['smoker.never']	['smoker.never']	[1.0]

Dear Dr. Barron:	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
5601 Edwards Street	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Review of Systems: Cardiac: No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.	['obese.mention.during_dct']	['obese.mention.before_dct']	[1.0]
There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Musculoskeletal: No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her lungs are clear to auscultation.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her weight is 213 pounds.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The carotid upstrokes are full.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her extremities show no edema.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
All others are negative.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.	['medication.statin..before_dct']	['medication.statin..before_dct']	[1.0]
She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has only mild mitral regurgitation.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She did receive drug-eluting stents.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We utilized the right radial artery for access.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The final angiographic result was excellent.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

Dear Dr. Pacheco:	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
New Milford Hospital	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Department of Medicine	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His glucose control by his history has been very good.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has several children, all in good health.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has no known drug allergies.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
No carotid bruits could be appreciated.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Those results were available for me today.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There was no jaw jerk.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Toes were downgoing bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He is to see her next on January 15, 2097.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Once again, thank you for your kind referral.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

He did deny	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

______________________________	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

Dear Dr. Kirk:	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Carrizoza Health Center	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
531 Westfield St	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	[1.0]
His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.	['hypertension.mention.after_dct']	['diabetes.mention.during_dct']	[1.0]
Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.	['diabetes.mention.during_dct']	['diabetes.mention.during_dct']	[1.0]
He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has not had any problems with spasms.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.	['cad.event.before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]

He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has no symptoms of aphasia.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I would agree with him.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.	['medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.	['smoker.past']	['smoker.never']	[1.0]
His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.	['medication.insulin..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His blood pressure was 150/90.	['hypertension.high_bp.during_dct']	['hypertension.high_bp.during_dct']	[1.0]
b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o.	['medication.thienopyridine..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o.	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	[1.0]
q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o.	['medication.fibrate..during_dct']	['medication.statin..during_dct']	[1.0]
b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.	['medication.nitrate..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
He was alert and oriented.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His language was intact.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There was full range of motion of the joints.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

The visual fields were full.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His right toe was downgoing.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His conversation was appropriate.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Facial sensation was normal.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.	['medication.fibrate..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.	['medication.thienopyridine..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.	['medication.fibrate..during_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
I hope that this will be the case.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He should continue on an aspirin a day.	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	[1.0]

He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In general, he is in no apparent distress.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His heart rate is 60 and regular.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He never had any further testing.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has no known drug allergies.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has been working in Borders.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has felt very well.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He was evaluated and released.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has no children.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His abdomen is benign.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.	['medication.aspirin..before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.	['medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct']	['medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct']	[1.0]
He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Also, his systolic function has improved over time.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I think there are two processes going on.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
His LDL goal will be less than 100.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I suspect that this is myocarditis.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

without bruits.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing	['medication.beta_blocker..after_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I will let you know the results of her stress test when they	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Plan: I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I have also asked her to have a fasting blood	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Thank you for allowing me to take part in this	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The etiology of this is not clear at the	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the	['hypertension.mention.after_dct']	['hypertension.mention.after_dct']	[1.0]
setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

The right ventricle was mildly dilated and	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

There was trace	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

In addition some	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
moment.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

call me with any further questions or concerns.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
If this evaluation should be unrevealing,	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.	['cad.event.before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

Dear Hicks,	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Surgery	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.	['smoker.past']	['smoker.past']	[1.0]
Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Her abdomen is benign.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.	['cad.event.before_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.	['cad.mention.during_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

______________________________	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.	['smoker.current']	['Other']	[1.0]
Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She lives alone and is a widow.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There are no medication allergies reported.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She has a 12th grade education.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Height is 5 foot 3 inches.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Poor neck posture is noted.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She uses alcohol occasionally.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient is overweight.	['obese.mention.after_dct']	['Other']	[1.0]
Weight is 217 pounds.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Temporal arteries are normal.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Tandem gait is normal.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Romberg is negative.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Coordination testing today seemed intact.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Extraocular movements are full.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Visual fields are intact.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Hearing is intact.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Oropharynx is normal.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Palate elevates well.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Tongue is midline.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
PLAN: Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
IMPRESSION: Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]

The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.	['Other']	['Other']	[1.0]
