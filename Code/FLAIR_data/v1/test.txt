__label__Other Mr. Villegas is seen today.
__label__Other I have not seen him since November.
__label__Other About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
__label__Other he was gaining weight.
__label__Other He does feel that his shoulders are
__label__Other definitely improved.
"__label__Other It is unclear what he is actually taking, but"
__label__Other I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
__label__Other and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.
__label__Other He is concerned because of the
__label__Other relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
__label__Other right.
"__label__Other When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he"
__label__Other is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.
__label__Other This
__label__Other only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.
__label__Other He has
__label__Other no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
__label__Other cranial complaints.
"__label__Other On examination today, BP 120/80."
__label__Other He has no bruits over the
__label__Other carotid.
__label__Other He has no tenderness in this region either.
__label__Other He has good
__label__Other peripheral pulses at the arms.
__label__Other His joint examination is much
__label__Other improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
__label__Other synovitis.
__label__Other Clinical Impression:
__label__Other #1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
__label__Other Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.
__label__Other He has stopped the
"__label__Other Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet."
__label__Other #2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
__label__Other disease.
__label__Other Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.
__label__Other Patient
__label__Other advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed"
__label__Other that he continue to do so.
__label__Other He will follow-up with me shortly after
__label__Other the ultrasound study.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Law:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
"__label__Other As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma."
"__label__Other Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain."
__label__Other He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
"__label__Other The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant."
"__label__Other Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker."
__label__Other Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
__label__Other His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.
"__label__Other The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms."
__label__Other The P-wave is 5.6 mV.
__label__Other The R-wave is 31.3 mV.
"__label__Other The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec."
"__label__Other In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement."
__label__Other His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.
__label__Other There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.
"__label__Other However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing."
"__label__Other Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal."
__label__Other I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.
"__label__Other For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated."
__label__Other I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.
"__label__Other I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me."

__label__Other Dear Dr. Gordon:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.
"__label__Other As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma."

__label__Other He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted."
__label__Other We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.
__label__Other He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.
"__label__Other However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review."
__label__Other Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.
__label__Other The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.
__label__Other The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.
__label__Other The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.
"__label__Other The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec."
"__label__Other In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well."
"__label__Other However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation."
__label__Other I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.
"__label__Other In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia."
"__label__Other Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure."
__label__Other Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.
"__label__Other I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC."
__label__Other I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.
"__label__Other If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me."

__label__Other ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
__label__Other DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.
__label__Other HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133.
"__label__Other At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma."
__label__Other Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans.
"__label__Other For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy."
__label__Other A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
__label__Other CT scan was repeated in December of 2137.
__label__Other This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules.
__label__Other Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules.
__label__Other Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer.
"__label__Other His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance."
__label__Other He has met with Drs.
__label__Other Eagle and Yzaguirre.
"__label__Other Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well."
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
__label__Other 1.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other CVA with residual weakness on the right side.
"__label__Other He is, however, still able to walk with a cane."
__label__Other 3.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.before_dct High cholesterol.
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol."
__label__Other DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.
__label__smoker.past SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history.
__label__Other He last smoked in 2132.
__label__Other He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.
"__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms."
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM:
"__label__Other No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing"
__label__Other No gynecomastia
__label__Other Respiration comfortable
"__label__Other Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane."
__label__Other No skeletal deformity or tenderness
"__label__Other Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal "
"__label__Other Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses."
__label__Other No hernias.
"__label__Other RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across."
"__label__Other He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm."
__label__Other Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.
__label__Other Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.
__label__Other For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.
__label__Other Consent obtained today.

__label__Other Dear Wanda:
__label__Other Nancy Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May
"__label__Other in that the triglycerides have decreased to 460, pretty much where"
__label__Other they had usually been.
__label__Other The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL
__label__Other has declined to 34.
"__label__Other All in all, the results are compatible with"
__label__medication.statin..during_dct better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is
__label__Other likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand
__label__medication.fibrate..after_dct discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.
__label__Other The
__label__medication.statin..during_dct effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is
__label__Other minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated
__label__Other except at the high dose of 80 mg.
__label__medication.statin..during_dct Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could
__label__Other not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,"
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct Procardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units"
__label__Other A.M.
"__label__Other Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG."
"__label__Other 460, HDL 34, LDL 93."
__label__Other Blood pressure is 120/80.
"__label__medication.fibrate..after_dct I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d."
__label__Other and left her on the
__label__medication.statin..during_dct Atorvastatin 10 mg.
__label__Other Although I don't expect any side effects with
__label__medication.statin..during_dct this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner
__label__Other and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or
__label__Other weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication.
__label__Other I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.

__label__Other MRN: 53023691
__label__Other Dear Dr. Xayarath:
__label__Other Your patient Mr.
__label__Other Earnest
__label__Other Branche returned to the
__label__Other office today for a follow
__label__Other up visit.
"__label__Other As you know,"
__label__Other Mr. Branche underwent a
__label__Other left femoral to posterior
__label__Other tibial bypass one month
__label__Other ago followed by
__label__Other amputation of a
__label__Other gangrenous first toe.
__label__Other After being discharged
__label__Other from our service he was
__label__Other readmitted to the Medical
__label__Other Service with a severe
__label__Other case of C. difficile
__label__Other colitis.
__label__Other Ultimately this
__label__Other resolved and he was
__label__Other discharged.
__label__Other Today he
__label__Other reports that the diarrhea
__label__Other has again resumed and he
__label__Other was placed back on an
__label__Other oral antibiotic
__label__Other yesterday.
__label__Other He complains
__label__Other of only mild incisional
__label__Other discomfort in his left
__label__Other leg.
"__label__Other On examination, there is"
__label__Other a strong pulse easily
__label__Other palpated over the left
__label__Other lower extremity bypass
__label__Other graft.
__label__Other The old right
__label__Other graft was also palpable.
__label__Other The left foot itself is
__label__Other warm.
__label__Other The great toe
"__label__Other incision site, however,"
__label__Other has developed necrotic
__label__Other tissue all along the
"__label__Other incision, which was"
__label__Other sharply debrided to clean
__label__Other margins.
__label__Other This will now
__label__Other need to be treated as an
__label__Other open wound.
__label__Other The calf
__label__Other portion of the left lower
__label__Other extremity incision also
__label__Other has a narrow zone of
__label__Other superficial skin slough
__label__Other which was gently
__label__Other debrided.
__label__Other The graft is
__label__Other not exposed and there are
__label__Other no deep wounds in the
__label__Other Mr. Branche's left lower
__label__Other extremity bypass graft is
__label__Other functioning well.
"__label__Other However, he will require"
__label__Other significant ongoing wound
__label__Other care for the immediate
__label__Other future.
__label__Other Daily dressing
__label__Other changes will be arranged
__label__Other with visiting nurse
__label__Other services.
__label__Other We plan to
__label__Other follow him closely and an
__label__Other appointment was given for
__label__Other two weeks.
__label__Other Thanks again for allowing
__label__Other us to participate in the
__label__Other care of this delightful
__label__Other and challenging patient
__label__Other and please don't hesitate
__label__Other to contact me at any time

"__label__Other RE:Branch, Earnest"
__label__Other MRN:53023691
__label__Other Dear Dr. Xayarath:
__label__Other Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up 
__label__Other visit.
__label__Other Mr.
__label__Other Branch is now two years out from a right femoral-
__label__Other tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial 
__label__Other bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot 
__label__Other and split-thickness skin grafting.
"__label__Other Over the last several months, "
"__label__Other he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, "
"__label__Other superficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot."
__label__Other Over the 
"__label__Other last one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new "
__label__Other area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and 
__label__Other recently has noted some drainage.
__label__Other He denies any fevers.
__label__Other In 
"__label__Other addition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the "
__label__Other right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic 
__label__Other immediately following his visit with us.
__label__Other He last underwent 
__label__Other vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower 
__label__Other extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.
"__label__Other On examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses "
__label__Other over both lower extremity bypass grafts.
__label__Other The right foot is warm 
__label__Other and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.
__label__Other On 
"__label__Other examination of the left foot, there is a large area of full-"
__label__Other thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where 
__label__Other there had never been any previous open wounds.
__label__Other This area 
__label__Other encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the 
__label__Other foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal 
__label__Other mid foot.
"__label__Other On probing, purulent material drains from the margins "
__label__Other and there is obvious significant sepsis.
__label__Other The foot itself is warm 
__label__Other and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, Mr."
"__label__Other Branch has developed a new, large wound on the "
__label__Other left foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration 
__label__Other due to his severe neuropathy.
__label__Other This is now complicated by 
__label__Other significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue 
__label__Other loss on the foot.
__label__Other He will require urgent admission and operative 
__label__Other debridement today.
"__label__Other In addition, given the extent of the problem, "
__label__Other it is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation 
__label__Other in the end.
__label__Other Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology 
"__label__Other Clinic, he will be admitted to the"
__label__Other 3-8-82
__label__Other Page 2
__label__Other hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage 
__label__Other later today.
__label__Other I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of 
__label__Other his progress.

__label__Other I also saw 
"__label__Other the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation "
__label__Other and plan.
__label__Other PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.
__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 
__label__Other complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.
__label__Other He came 
__label__Other in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a 
__label__Other highly elevated glucose and was sent over here.
__label__Other The patient denies 
"__label__Other any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he "
__label__Other feels poorly.
"__label__Other Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood "
__label__diabetes.glucose.during_dct sugar was noted to be greater than 600.
__label__Other The patient does not 
__label__Other complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 
"__label__Other light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath."
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note.
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.
"__label__Other Otherwise, as per the "
__label__Other resident's note.
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, "
__label__Other respirations 22.
__label__Other The patient appears to be in no acute distress.
__label__Other The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.
__label__Other There is 
__label__Other jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.
__label__Other Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.
__label__Other Abdominal examination is 
__label__Other within normal limits.
__label__Other The patient has a colostomy.
__label__Other The patient 
__label__Other has a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on 
__label__Other the right side.
"__label__Other Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal "
__label__Other abnormalities.
__label__Other There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.
__label__Other LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose 
"__label__Other of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 "
"__label__Other and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual."
__label__Other His pH is 7.42.
"__label__Other CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45."
"__label__Other Of note, however, "
__label__Other the patient does have renal conditions.
__label__Other EKG shows new deep Qs in 
"__label__Other 2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago."
__label__Other Chest x-ray shows 
__label__Other some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.
__label__Other THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have 
__label__Other congestive heart failure.
"__label__Other He may be having new cardiac event, "
__label__Other although after a consultation with the Integra Health
"__label__Other cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, "
__label__Other but rather due to axis deviation.
__label__Other The patient is being treated for 
__label__Other his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.
__label__Other FINAL DIAGNOSES:
__label__Other 1.

__label__Other Interval History:
__label__Other    The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.
"__label__Other He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17."
"__label__Other At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation."
__label__Other He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.
__label__Other He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.
__label__Other His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization."
__label__Other He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.
__label__Other He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.
__label__Other He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.
__label__Other A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.
__label__Other The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.
"__label__Other On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage."
"__label__Other A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function."
__label__Other Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.
__label__Other An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.
__label__Other HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.
"__label__Other His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit."
__label__Other ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.
__label__Other He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim.
__label__Other He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.
"__label__Other With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit."
__label__Other His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA.
__label__Other He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder.
__label__Other He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.
"__label__Other Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well."
__label__Other He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.

__label__Other Dear Thomas:
__label__Other   Thank you very much for referring Mr.
"__label__cad.mention.after_dct Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery."
__label__Other Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.
__label__cad.event.before_dct The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred."
__label__Other It has been progressive over the last several months.
__label__Other He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.
__label__Other He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.

__label__Other Social history:
"__label__smoker.past    The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065."
__label__Other He does not drink alcohol.
__label__Other He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.
__label__Other Review of systems:
"__label__Other    Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain."
__label__Other He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.
__label__Other He denies hematochezia.
"__label__Other He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis."
"__label__Other He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema."
__label__Other He denies dysuria or hematuria.
__label__Other He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.
__label__Other Physical examination:
__label__Other -Pulse:   55 and regular
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct -BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position
__label__Other -resp.
__label__Other rate:   12 and unlabored
"__label__Other -Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag."
__label__Other Mucous membranes are moist.
__label__Other Trachea is midline
__label__Other -Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.
__label__Other Carotids are 2+ without bruits.
__label__Other Have a normal upstroke.
__label__Other JVP is less than 7 cm of water
"__label__Other -Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes."
__label__Other He does have low dullness in both bases
__label__Other -Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.
__label__Other He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur
__label__Other -Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
__label__Other No organomegaly.
__label__Other No pulsatile masses
__label__Other -Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
__label__Other He has no pedal edema.
__label__Other He has no clubbing or cyanosis
__label__Other Procedures:
__label__Other Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.
__label__Other His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.
__label__Other Peak blood pressure was 158/80.
__label__Other He had no chest pain.
__label__Other Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.
__label__Other The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.
__label__Other EKG:
"__label__Other     today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities."
__label__Other Selected recent labs:
"__label__Other  Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096."
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct    In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096."
__label__Other His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again.
__label__Other There are a number of factors involved here.
__label__Other He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled.
"__label__Other I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath."
__label__Other He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura.
__label__Other He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.
__label__Other He also has low platelets.
__label__cad.mention.after_dct The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia.
"__label__Other It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation."
"__label__Other He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time."
__label__Other Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile.
__label__Other He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well.
__label__cad.mention.after_dct My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this.
__label__Other He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done.
"__label__Other I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization."
"__label__Other I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia."
__label__Other Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization.
"__label__Other Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address."

__label__Other given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden
"__label__Other since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with"

__label__Other If this is similar to her previous study showing only

__label__Other The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 
__label__Other cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.
__label__Other She was 
__label__Other subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 
__label__Other thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.
__label__Other The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 
__label__Other was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 
__label__Other reimplanted.
"__label__Other According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be "
__label__Other locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.
__label__Other The 
__label__Other pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 
__label__Other lymphovascular invasion.
__label__Other There was an additional focus of papillary 
"__label__Other carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm."
__label__Other Of

__label__Other The tumor 
__label__Other did stain positively for thyroglobulin.
"__label__Other Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well."
__label__Other She has been 
__label__Other maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.
__label__Other She says that she feels generally

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.
__label__Other This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.
__label__medication.diuretic..during_dct He began the Captopril and HCTZ (?

__label__Other At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.

__label__Other On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.
__label__Other He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this.

__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.
__label__Other His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.

__label__Other IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.

__label__Other 	Reason for visit:
__label__Other    Elective cardiac catheterization prior to CABG
__label__Other 	Interval History:
__label__Other    Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
"__label__cad.event.before_dct This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI."
__label__Other This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
"__label__Other Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow."
"__label__Other At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea."
__label__Other He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes.
"__label__Other His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6."
__label__Other An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3.
__label__Other He never developed chest pain.
__label__cad.test.before_dct An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease.
__label__Other The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis.
__label__Other The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease.
__label__Other The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%.
__label__cad.test.before_dct The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness.
"__label__Other Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result."
__label__Other His peak CK was 305 during that admission.
"__label__Other An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis."
__label__Other He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG.
__label__Other It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present.
__label__Other He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96.
__label__Other The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint.
"__label__Other He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope."
"__label__Other He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain."
__label__Other He denies any calf pain.

__label__Other She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085.
"__label__Other Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker."
"__label__Other She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis."
__label__Other Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.
"__label__Other Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder."
"__label__Other Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital."
"__label__Other She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively."
"__label__Other She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight."
__label__Other Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range.
"__label__Other Since her last visit, she has done well at home."
"__label__Other Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes."

"__label__Other Cozad, OK  53952"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Barron:
__label__Other Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.
__label__cad.event.before_dct I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.
__label__Other Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance."
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia."
"__label__Other On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest."
__label__cad.event.before_dct She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.
__label__Other I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.
"__label__Other Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well."
__label__Other She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.
__label__Other Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.
__label__Other She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day."
__label__Other She has no known drug allergies.
__label__Other Social History:  She is married and has three children.
__label__Other She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.
__label__Other Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.
__label__smoker.never She has never used tobacco.
__label__cad.event.before_dct Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.
__label__Other There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.
"__label__Other Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema."
__label__Other Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.
__label__Other All others are negative.
"__label__Other On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress."
__label__Other Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.
__label__Other Her weight is 213 pounds.
__label__Other Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.
__label__Other There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.
__label__Other The carotid upstrokes are full.
__label__Other Her lungs are clear to auscultation.
"__label__Other The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced."
__label__Other The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.
"__label__obese.mention.during_dct The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds."
__label__Other Her extremities show no edema.
__label__Other Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.
__label__cad.event.before_dct She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.
__label__Other I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.
"__label__Other On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram."
__label__Other She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.
__label__Other She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.
__label__Other There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.
__label__Other She has only mild mitral regurgitation.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting."
__label__Other She did receive drug-eluting stents.
__label__cad.event.before_dct The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.
"__label__cad.mention.during_dct What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time."
"__label__Other From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time."
"__label__Other She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint."
__label__Other I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.
"__label__Other To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia."
__label__Other We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor."
__label__Other The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.
"__label__Other In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself."
"__label__Other She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day."
__label__Other This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.
"__label__Other I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months."
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.
"__label__Other If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me."

__label__Other Dear Dr. Barron:
__label__Other I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia."
__label__Other We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.
__label__Other We utilized the right radial artery for access.
__label__cad.event.before_dct We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.
__label__Other This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.
__label__cad.event.before_dct We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.
__label__Other The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.
__label__Other The final angiographic result was excellent.
__label__Other The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy."
__label__Other I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.
"__label__Other If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me."
"__label__Other Sincerely,"
__label__Other ______________________________

__label__Other RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb
__label__Other SRI: 		134-43-51
__label__Other Dear Dr. You:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Jaquante Xuereb, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today."
"__label__Other As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery."
__label__Other He returns today for follow up evaluation.
"__label__Other He has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis."
__label__Other He had been on a course of p.o.
__label__Other antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.
"__label__Other The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg."
"__label__Other My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate."
"__label__Other We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis."
"__label__Other In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side."
__label__Other He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.
"__label__Other Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left."
__label__Other I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.
__label__Other My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.
"__label__Other If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly."
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other Mr. Xuereb returns to clinic for evaluation and management of recurrent ulcerations on the hypertrophic scar tissue along the medial aspect of the right lower extremity.
"__label__Other Today, on physical examination, the wound bed measured 1 cm x 0.7 cm."
"__label__Other The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided."
__label__Other The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage.
__label__Other The margin was clear.
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee.
__label__Other There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.
"__label__Other PLAN:  We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1/8"" thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape."
__label__Other Mr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.

"__label__Other Dear Dr. Higgins,"
__label__Other Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary
__label__Other care.
__label__Other I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.
__label__Other She
__label__Other comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face.
"__label__Other Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ."
__label__Other She has
__label__Other been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what
__label__Other she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had
__label__Other planned.
"__label__Other However, she has other medical problems which I will"
__label__Other deal with until she sees you.
"__label__Other At her last visit, there was a"
"__label__Other question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not"
__label__Other given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.
"__label__Other However,"
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,"
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include
"__label__medication.metformin..after_dct metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20"
"__label__Other q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra."
__label__Other Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces
__label__Other her pain.
__label__Other She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
__label__Other HEENT
__label__Other was otherwise unremarkable.
__label__Other I obtained blood studies which
"__label__Other revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62"
"__label__Other and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8"
"__label__Other with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of"
__label__Other 14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.
__label__Other A1c
__label__Other pending.
__label__Other A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did
__label__Other not reveal proteinuria or sediment.
__label__Other HBsAG and HCV are pending as
__label__Other well.
__label__Other I will be in touch with her regarding these results.
__label__Other I was
__label__Other wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of
__label__Other these abnormalities outlined.
__label__Other Thanks for letting me participate
__label__Other in her care.

__label__Other Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.
__label__Other A lot has happened since she

__label__Other She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.

__label__Other therefore has been having financial problems.
__label__Other She does not have enough money to

__label__Other She has not taken these medications for months.
__label__Other She states she has been taking her
"__label__Other nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed."
__label__Other When I called her from
"__label__Other the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before"
__label__Other she fell.
__label__Other We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
__label__Other taken.

__label__Other She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
__label__Other to falling.
"__label__Other She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in"
"__label__Other mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait."
"__label__Other On review of other systems, she"
__label__Other reports a 20 lb.
__label__Other weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
__label__Other working and being at home and eating more than usual.
__label__Other She also notes that she has
__label__Other begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.
__label__Other She complains of excessive
__label__Other dry mouth.
__label__Other She reports being more thirsty than usual.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self."

__label__Other RADIOLOGY
__label__Other Chest CT:  4/11/96
__label__Other 	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to
__label__Other 	suggest pulmonary embolism.
__label__Other There are several mediastinal lymph
__label__Other 	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size.
"__label__Other However, in the"
__label__Other 	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes
__label__Other 	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis.
__label__Other These could be
__label__Other 	reactive or neoplastic.
__label__Other There is a less than 1 cm left hilar
__label__Other 	node.
__label__Other In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm
__label__Other 	parenchymal nodule.
__label__Other This is best demonstrated on image 65.
__label__Other This
__label__Other 	could possibly represent a malignancy.
__label__Other Alternatively this could
__label__Other 	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node.
__label__Other This does not appear to
__label__Other 	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less
__label__Other 	likely.
__label__Other Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial
__label__Other 	right lung base.
__label__Other There is no pneumothorax.
__label__Other No significant
__label__Other 	pleural fluid is noted.
__label__Other There is no pericardial fluid.
__label__Other IMPRESSION:
__label__Other 	No pulmonary embolism or DVT.
__label__Other There are multiple mediastinal
__label__Other 	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.
__label__Other Neoplasm cannot be excluded.
__label__Other A follow-up chest CT may be further
__label__Other 	value.

"__label__cad.event.before_dct This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating."

__label__Other Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:
__label__Other DATE OF CONSULTATION:
"__label__Other DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate."
__label__Other HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.
"__label__Other His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1."
__label__Other Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.
"__label__Other He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency."
"__label__Other He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be."
__label__Other The erections are still an important issue with him.
__label__Other Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.
__label__Other He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.
__label__Other In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.
__label__Other Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.
__label__Other Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.
__label__Other Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
__label__Other 1.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Diabetes.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Tonsillectomy.

__label__Other Right inguinal hernia repair.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Inflammatory bowel disease.
"__label__medication.sulfonylureas..before_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia."
__label__Other DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.
"__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease."
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.
__label__Other He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.
__label__Other He has no children.
__label__smoker.past He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM:
"__label__Other No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing"
__label__Other No gynecomastia
__label__Other Respiration comfortable
__label__Other No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs
__label__Other No skeletal deformity or tenderness
"__label__Other Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal "
"__label__Other Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses."
__label__Other No hernias.
"__label__Other Normal penis, scrotum, and testes."
__label__Other Rectum: no mural lesion.
__label__Other Stool guaiac negative
__label__Other Prostate is small.
__label__Other The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.
"__label__Other I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference."
"__label__Other Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years."
__label__Other His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.
"__label__Other On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation."
__label__Other While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.
__label__Other We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.
"__label__Other Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation."
__label__Other Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

__label__Other Patient: Oscar Meyer  #277-14-47
"__label__Other RADIATION ONCOLOGIST: VICTOR M. ZUBIA, MD "
__label__Other DATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) 
"__label__Other DIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1"
__label__Other CONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam.
__label__Other An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.
"__label__Other Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease."
__label__Other Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.
__label__Other CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.
"__label__Other He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment."
__label__Other SPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT.
__label__Other Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound.
__label__Other SUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone.
__label__Other The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day.
__label__Other He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34.
__label__Other Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy.
"__label__Other CLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil."
__label__Other Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.
__label__Other FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.

__label__Other He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095.
__label__Other At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling.
__label__Other He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally.
__label__Other He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA."
__label__Other His ejection fraction at that time was 40%.
__label__Other He was referred for surgery.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1."

__label__Other RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
__label__Other CDH#810 86 43 7
__label__Other Dear Dr. Shirley:
__label__Other Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.
__label__Other Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
__label__Other underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
__label__Other hysterectomy in early October of 2078.
__label__Other Her post-operative course was 
__label__Other complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
__label__Other October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
__label__Other which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
__label__Other The episode was accompanied by 
__label__Other some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
__label__Other any palpitations.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
__label__Other any symptomatic recurrences.
__label__Other Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
__label__Other she has been recovering well.
__label__Other She has no prior cardiac history.
__label__Other She 
"__label__Other specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient "
__label__Other neurologic symptoms.
__label__Other She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
__label__Other mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.
__label__Other She feels that her exertional 
__label__Other capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
__label__smoker.past stopped smoking.
"__label__Other She does not have a known history of hypertension, however "
__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
__label__Other systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct with verapamil.
__label__Other There is no prior history of syncope.
__label__Other Page Two
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.
__label__Other has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.
__label__Other She previously smoked 
__label__Other two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
__label__Other any particular change in her health precipitating this.
__label__Other She rarely drinks 
__label__Other ethanol.
__label__Other She has not had any prior surgeries.
__label__Other Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.
__label__Other Review of 
__label__Other systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
__label__Other admission.
__label__obese.mention.during_dct Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular."
__label__Other HEENT 
__label__Other is externally unremarkable.
__label__Other There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.
__label__Other Carotids 
__label__Other are palpable bilaterally.
__label__Other Lungs are clear to auscultation.
__label__Other Cardiac exam 
__label__Other reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
__label__Other impulse.
__label__Other There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
__label__Other Abdomen 
__label__Other is soft and nontender.
__label__Other There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
__label__Other abdomen.
__label__Other Extremities are without edema.
__label__Other Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
__label__Other palpable.
__label__Other The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
"__label__Other of .18, QRS .08."
__label__Other There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
__label__Other and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.
__label__Other An 
"__label__Other echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although "
__label__Other with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
__label__Other My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
__label__Other the perioperative period.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
__label__Other not been previously treated.
__label__Other This would explain her electrocardiographic 
__label__Other changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
__label__Other atrial fibrillation.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.
__label__Other Once her incision is further healed we will 
__label__Other arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
__label__Other regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
__label__Other mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other Page Three
__label__Other will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
__label__Other tolerance test.
__label__Other We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
__label__Other report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.
__label__Other We also gave her a 
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
__label__Other medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
__label__Other which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"
"__label__Other Paul N. Shelton, M.D."

__label__Other the patient.
"__label__Other Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented "
"__label__Other with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, "
__label__Other essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.
__label__Other She 
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity "
__label__Other and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.
__label__Other Her 
__label__Other symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
"__label__Other noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI "
__label__Other systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
__label__Other border).
__label__Other LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
__label__Other changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.
__label__Other These were 
__label__Other previously noted in 10/78.
__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some "
__label__Other morphine to relieve her pain.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
__label__Other and was given some GI meds.

"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so."
__label__Other The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure."
__label__Other PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
"__label__Other Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above."
__label__Other CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
"__label__medication.insulin..before_dct Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin."
__label__Other Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
"__label__Other On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level."
"__label__Other Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well."
__label__Other The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.
"__label__Other There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted."
__label__Other Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.
"__label__Other However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact."
"__label__Other Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:
__label__Other As above.
__label__Other PLAN:
__label__Other My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.
"__label__Other In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers."
__label__Other It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

__label__Other His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits.
"__label__Other The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy."
__label__Other He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.
__label__Other Recommendations: 
"__label__Other -   check UA, NH3"
"__label__Other -   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g."
__label__Other with Labetalol.
"__label__Other -   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal."
__label__Other -  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity

__label__Other 	Reason for visit:
__label__cad.event.before_dct    consulted by Dr Dunham for continuity of care s/p cabg
__label__Other 	Interval History:
__label__cad.mention.before_dct    This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham.
__label__cad.event.before_dct Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.
__label__Other He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance.
"__label__Other Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees."
__label__Other He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI.
__label__Other There was global hypokinesis.
__label__Other Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076).
"__label__Other There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss."
"__label__Other His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved."
__label__Other He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty.
"__label__Other Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB."
__label__Other He still feels fatigued throughout the day.

__label__Other His preoperative evaluation 
__label__Other included 
"__label__Other a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine "

"__label__Other Since this was a small area, it was felt "

__label__Other with 
__label__Other no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.
__label__Other However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 
__label__Other 35 and a troponin of 19.5.
"__label__Other As a result of his large troponin leak, he "
"__label__Other underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left "
"__label__Other main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary "

__label__Other Dear Bethany: 
"__label__Other I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today."
"__label__Other Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications."
"__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above."
__label__Other Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range."
__label__Other She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.
"__label__Other After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms."
"__label__Other When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back."
__label__Other She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.
__label__Other She has not had palpitations.
"__label__medication.metformin..before_dct She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy."
__label__Other She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits.
"__label__Other She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described."
__label__Other She has not had any peripheral numbness.
__label__Other The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner."
"__label__Other On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96."
"__label__Other The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks."
__label__Other She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.
__label__Other The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.
__label__Other She is fully alert.
__label__Other The neck veins are not elevated.
__label__Other The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.
__label__Other There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.
__label__Other The lungs are clear.
__label__Other The PMI is not displaced.
"__label__Other There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva."
__label__Other The abdomen is benign.
__label__Other There is no renal artery bruit.
__label__Other The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.
__label__Other There is no tenderness of her skin.
"__label__Other The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening."
__label__Other Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.
"__label__Other The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head."
"__label__Other However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels."
__label__Other I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.
"__label__Other Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves."
__label__Other I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.
__label__Other We are pleased with the present regimen.
"__label__Other We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now."
"__label__Other We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged."
"__label__medication.metformin..before_dct I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values."
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.
__label__Other I know that you will continue to follow her closely.
__label__Other I told her that I would see her again in nine months.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other Ischemic event is less likely in this man.
"__label__Other EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090."
__label__Other Other possible causes include:
__label__Other   	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.
"__label__Other However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency."
"__label__diabetes.glucose.before_dct Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology."
__label__Other Plan:
__label__Other 1)	Continue hydration overnight.
__label__Other 2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.
__label__Other 3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.
__label__Other 4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.
"__label__Other 5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam."
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.
"__label__Other Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification."
"__label__Other Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range."
"__label__Other 1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI."
__label__Other 2)     Q6h finger stick check.
__label__Other 3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.
__label__Other L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.
__label__Other Tender to palpation and with joint movement.
__label__Other No signs of infection.
__label__Other Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.
__label__Other 1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.
__label__Other 2)     PT consult.
"__label__Other FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5)."
__label__Other Eating PO.
__label__Other On IVF for hydration.
__label__Other 1)	Replete Mg.  
__label__Other 2)     K now 3.6.
"__label__Other If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4."
__label__Other 3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.
"__label__Other Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin."

"__label__Other He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat."
"__label__Other He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint."
"__label__Other He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak."
"__label__Other He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode."
"__label__Other He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures."
"__label__Other When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED."
"__label__Other One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping."
"__label__Other Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma."
"__label__Other As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed."
"__label__Other According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him."
__label__Other He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.
"__label__Other He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup."

__label__Other At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.
"__label__Other In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness."
"__label__Other He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets."
__label__Other He has had no other symptoms.
"__label__Other Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am."
__label__Other He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.

"__label__Other However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain."
"__label__Other Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s."
"__label__Other However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion."
__label__Other It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen.

__label__Other History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being

__label__Other ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.
__label__Other The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
__label__Other the past with a decreased LV function.
__label__Other However repeat echo within the 
__label__Other past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
__label__Other of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
__label__Other Humbert Hospital against medical advice.
__label__Other After being evaluated in the

__label__Other discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate "

__label__Other History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
__label__Other me.
__label__Other I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct disease, hypertension, and diabetes."
__label__Other The patient has had a positive 
__label__Other exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
__label__Other that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.
"__label__Other However, patient was "
__label__Other overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
__label__Other approximately 50 lb.
__label__Other at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
__label__Other catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.
__label__Other Patient was seen last night 
__label__Other in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
__label__Other which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
__label__Other flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.
__label__Other On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.
__label__Other His exam was 
__label__Other notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.
__label__Other His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
__label__Other well.
"__label__Other His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, "
__label__Other did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.
__label__Other An 
__label__Other abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
__label__Other presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.
__label__Other IVP 
__label__Other was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.
__label__Other He was given Toradol 
__label__Other in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
__label__Other Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.
__label__Other I was called by 
__label__Other the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
__label__Other flank.
"__label__Other On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was "
__label__Other brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.
__label__Other On exam 
__label__Other he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
__label__Other pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
__label__Other abdomen.
__label__Other Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
__label__Other peritoneal signs.
__label__Other Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
__label__Other pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
"__label__Other musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I "
__label__Other feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
__label__Other undergo this study this afternoon.
__label__Other I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
"__label__Other with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to "
__label__Other rule out pancreatitis.
"__label__Other Of note, patient does have a history of peptic "
"__label__Other ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and "
"__label__Other reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena."
__label__Other He is also 
__label__Other status post cholecystectomy.
__label__Other I will review his IVP later today and make 
__label__Other further therapeutic interventions at that time.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Short:
__label__Other I did see Irene Upshur for a followup today.
"__label__Other As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction."
"__label__diabetes.glucose.before_dct Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300."
__label__Other She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.
"__label__Other When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it."
"__label__Other On examination today, she otherwise appears well."
__label__Other Ears are unremarkable.
__label__Other Her eardrums are intact.
__label__Other She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.
__label__Other Her gait is normal.
__label__Other There is no nystagmus.
"__label__Other An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric."
__label__Other Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.
__label__Other Assessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.
__label__Other Plan:  She does take multiple medications.
__label__Other It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.
__label__Other I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.
"__label__Other If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction, I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops."
__label__Other This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.
"__label__medication.arb..after_dct However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil."
__label__Other I would need to clear to switch herself ??____??
"__label__Other therapy, I would like to see her back after consistent trial of the corticosteroid spray topically."
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

"__label__Other RE: Emery, Donn "
__label__Other NMH#: 059-57-26 
__label__Other Dear Dr. Pacheco:  
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently."
__label__Other Thank you for your kind referral.
__label__Other I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.
__label__Other Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy.
__label__Other His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands.
__label__Other This had extended over several months to include his feet as well.
"__label__Other Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left."
__label__Other At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago.
__label__Other Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms.
"__label__Other He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet."
__label__Other He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face.
"__label__Other He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems."
__label__Other He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion.
"__label__Other Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable."
"__label__Other Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins."
__label__Other He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence.
"__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50."
__label__Other His glucose control by his history has been very good.
"__label__Other He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur."
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage."
__label__Other He has no known drug allergies.
"__label__smoker.never He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals."
__label__Other His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.
__label__Other He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection.
"__label__Other He has several children, all in good health."
"__label__Other On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function."
__label__Other No carotid bruits could be appreciated.
__label__Other The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.
"__label__Other He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally."
__label__Other Funduscopy was normal bilaterally.
__label__Other Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.
"__label__Other The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally."
__label__Other Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.
"__label__Other On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout."
"__label__Other There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally."
"__label__Other Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally."
"__label__Other In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full."
__label__Other Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities.
"__label__Other Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact."
"__label__Other There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic."
__label__Other Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.
__label__Other Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout.
"__label__Other Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis."
__label__Other There was no jaw jerk.
__label__Other Toes were downgoing bilaterally.
__label__Other Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution.
__label__Other Those results were available for me today.
"__label__Other They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities."
__label__Other Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.
"__label__Other There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis."
"__label__Other With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration."
"__label__Other There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon."
"__label__Other The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence."
__label__Other I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time."
"__label__Other We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____."
"__label__Other However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him."
"__label__Other Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem."
"__label__Other I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future."
__label__Other If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.
"__label__Other Once again, thank you for your kind referral."
"__label__Other Sincerely, "

"__label__Other December 29, 2096"
__label__Other INTERVAL HISTORY:
"__label__Other He has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis."
"__label__Other He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. "
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
__label__Other General:  Complaint of mild fatigue.
"__label__Other No fevers, chills, or change in appetite."
"__label__Other HEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness."
"__label__Other Pulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing."
"__label__Other Cardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations."
"__label__Other Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain."
"__label__Other Urologic:  No dysuria, hematuria."
__label__Other Lymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
"__label__Other Musculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain."
"__label__Other Hematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting."
"__label__Other Neurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right."
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.
__label__Other He has had some moderately severe back pain.
__label__Other REVIEW OF STUDIES:
"__label__Other Blood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3."
"__label__Other I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing."
"__label__Other A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months."
"__label__Other If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age."
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
__label__Other Weight:  175 lb.
__label__Other with shoes.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine."
__label__Other He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.
__label__Other Skin:  Normal.
"__label__Other Lymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy."
__label__Other There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.
__label__Other Lungs:  Clear.
__label__Other Heart:  Normal.
__label__Other Abdomen:  No masses or tenderness.
__label__Other Extremities:  No evidence of DVT.
__label__Other No edema.
"__label__Other Rectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  
"__label__Other He is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone."
"__label__Other His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall."
__label__Other I will see him next in six months.

__label__Other 	Interval History:
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct    This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure."
"__label__Other The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation."
"__label__Other He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting."
__label__Other The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.
"__label__Other Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization."
"__label__Other The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent."
"__label__Other Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise)."
__label__Other The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future."

__label__Other Dear Kenneth: 
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention."
"__label__Other He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union."
"__label__Other At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.
__label__Other He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.
__label__Other MEDICATIONS:
__label__Other 1.
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct Aspirin 325 mg daily.
__label__Other 2.
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.
__label__Other 3.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
__label__Other 4.
__label__medication.fibrate..after_dct Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.
__label__Other 5.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
__label__Other 6.
"__label__Other Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin."
__label__Other INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:
__label__Other Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.
__label__Other Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.
"__label__Other On examination, he is comfortable at rest."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%."
__label__Other The jugular venous pressure is 5.
__label__Other The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.
__label__Other The chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.
"__label__Other The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits."
__label__Other There is no peripheral pitting edema.
"__label__Other The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093."
"__label__Other In summary, Mr. Lara has:"
"__label__cad.event.before_dct History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction."
"__label__Other Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension, not controlled."
__label__Other His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.
__label__Other We spoke about the options.
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure."
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..after_dct He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.
"__label__Other To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH."
"__label__Other A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly."
"__label__Other Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow."
__label__Other [Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms.
__label__Other Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines.
"__label__Other He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations."
__label__Other He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]
"__label__medication.fibrate..during_dct Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy."
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy."
__label__Other A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.
__label__Other Mild mitral regurgitation.
__label__Other It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.

__label__Other       DOB: 08/02/2095
__label__Other Dear Dr. Calhoun;
__label__Other We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism.
"__label__Other As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck."
__label__Other We.
__label__Other started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine.
"__label__Other In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels."
__label__Other We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.
__label__Other He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication.

__label__Other 10.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Coronary artery disease with status post stent.
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days.
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day."
__label__Other ALLERGIES: Tape.
__label__smoker.unknown SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children.
"__label__Other Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds."
__label__Other Height 5 feet 4 inches.
__label__Other LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171.
__label__Other His hematocrit is 39.
"__label__Other It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000."
__label__Other White count 4.8.
"__label__Other In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer."
__label__Other The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy.
__label__Other I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism.
"__label__Other He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid."
__label__Other We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now.
__label__Other Please let me know if you have any questions.
"__label__Other Yours sincerely, "

"__label__Other CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness"
__label__Other HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep."
__label__Other He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).
"__label__Other Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results."
__label__Other He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).
"__label__Other He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness."
"__label__Other He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea."
"__label__Other He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present."
"__label__Other To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia."
"__label__Other However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued."
"__label__Other On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50."
__label__Other Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.
"__label__Other EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF)."
"__label__Other He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s."
"__label__Other For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted."
"__label__Other Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)
__label__Other CXR by report was clear.
"__label__Other With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s."

__label__Other HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures."
__label__Other Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.
__label__Other He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.
"__label__Other He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD."
"__label__Other He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis."
"__label__Other Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis."
"__label__Other He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued."
__label__Other He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.
"__label__Other At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs."
__label__Other He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.
"__label__Other He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years."
"__label__Other He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day."
"__label__Other He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse."
__label__Other He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.
"__label__Other He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72."
"__label__Other He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs."
__label__Other He denies recent fevers or chills.
__label__Other He has no complaint of leg swelling.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Dill:
__label__Other DOB:  10/11/2082
__label__Other Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
"__label__Other As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea."
"__label__Other In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA."
__label__Other He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.
"__label__Other On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway."
__label__Other He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.
__label__Other He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.
"__label__Other He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful."
"__label__Other Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved."
__label__Other He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented."
__label__Other A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.
"__label__Other Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well."
__label__Other He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.
"__label__Other He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling."

__label__cad.event.before_dct He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.
"__label__Other A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis."
__label__Other Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.

"__label__Other There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus."
"__label__Other Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath."
__label__Other He appears to be functional class III.
"__label__Other He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease."
__label__Other We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.
__label__Other We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.
"__label__Other However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success."
"__label__Other Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation."
__label__Other We will leave this decision to them.
"__label__Other Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation."
__label__Other Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.
__label__Other We will be in touch following the procedure.
"__label__Other As always, feel free to call with any questions."

"__label__Other George, Rickey"
__label__Other MRN: 1131414
__label__Other 06/10/92
__label__Other REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.
__label__Other PROBLEMS:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.
__label__Other Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.
__label__Other He was managed by multiple
"__label__Other services including EP, Cardiology, and ID."
__label__Other His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
__label__Other with a prolonged course of fluconazole.
"__label__Other Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed"
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct effectively with carvedilol.
__label__Other Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
__label__Other hospitalization.
__label__Other He never had any sustained VT or VF.
__label__Other He was subsequently discharged home
__label__Other with a Life vest defibrillator.
__label__Other He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.
__label__Other He currently has no AICD or
__label__Other pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
__label__Other for his arrhythmia issues.
__label__Other He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.
__label__Other Currently
__label__Other his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
__label__Other regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other CHF.
"__label__Other Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went"
__label__Other directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him.
"__label__Other He had one episode of CHF, which"
"__label__Other was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously."
__label__Other At the
"__label__Other present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at"
__label__Other night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.
__label__Other He does
__label__Other continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix.
__label__Other 3.
__label__cad.mention.after_dct Coronary artery disease.
"__label__Other Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of"
__label__Other angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.
__label__Other His left TKR also required removal
__label__Other due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.
__label__Other He has had no
"__label__Other recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical"
__label__Other issues.
__label__Other He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
"__label__Other down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area."
__label__Other 5.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes mellitus.
__label__Other Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen"
__label__Other has been gradually decreased.
__label__medication.sulfonylureas..before_dct He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d.
__label__Other and he reports that his fasting
__label__Other sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
__label__Other range.
__label__Other He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.
__label__Other We will check
__label__Other his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
__label__Other Page 2
__label__Other 6.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Hyperlipidemia.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct He continues on Lipitor.
"__label__Other We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and"
__label__Other CPK.
__label__Other 7.
__label__Other Diabetic nephropathy.
__label__Other He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
__label__Other to re-establish baseline.
__label__Other 8.
__label__Other Status post CVA.
__label__Other Known moderate right carotid stenosis.
__label__Other Minimal residual dysarthria
__label__Other and right-sided weakness.
__label__Other Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.
__label__Other Was unable to get sufficient blood
__label__Other pressure by cuff.
"__label__Other Pulse 60, mostly irregular."
"__label__Other General, thin, but no distress."
"__label__Other Lungs, clear to"
__label__Other auscultation and percussion.
"__label__Other Cor, distant heart sounds."
__label__Other No S3 appreciated.
__label__Other Old pacer/AICD site.
__label__Other No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.
"__label__Other Extremities, trace edema bilaterally."
__label__Other DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.
"__label__Other ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of"
__label__Other both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.
"__label__Other At this time, he was"
__label__Other quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.
__label__Other He did deny
__label__Other abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.
"__label__Other At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and"
__label__Other send in to me by mail.
__label__Other I have also sent off a CBC today.
__label__Other I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
__label__Other next visit.
"__label__Other If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss"
"__label__Other more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be"
__label__Other aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

__label__Other   Rickey George
__label__Other   MR#1131414
"__label__Other   October 05, 2092"
__label__Other   Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.
__label__Other PROBLEMS:
__label__Other   PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe.
__label__Other Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.
__label__Other Treated by Dr. Randall.
__label__Other Underwent extensive
__label__Other   revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
"__label__Other   angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery"
"__label__Other   endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above"
__label__Other   knee popliteal bypass graft.
"__label__Other With this surgery, only his left second toe remained"
__label__Other   gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.
__label__Other He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
__label__Other   which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
__label__Other   foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.
__label__Other Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
__label__Other   this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
"__label__Other   EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of"
__label__Other   hospital discharge 9/9.
__label__Other Will recheck renal function today.
"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on"
"__label__Other   oral agents, and these have been discontinued."
__label__Other His blood sugars are now in the normal
__label__Other   range on no oral agents or insulin.
__label__Other Will need to monitor closely through rehab.
__label__Other CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d.
__label__Other of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.
__label__Other At the time of
__label__Other   hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d.
__label__Other and not surprisingly he developed quite
__label__Other   a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.
__label__Other He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
__label__Other   up to 60 b.i.d.
__label__Other but he still has significant edema.
__label__Other Will go back to 80 b.i.d.
__label__Other with close
__label__Other   monitoring.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct Will hold lisinopril
__label__Other   for now.
__label__Other Close VNA follow up.
__label__Other COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.
__label__Other Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.
__label__Other Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
__label__Other   and surgery with blood loss.
__label__Other His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
__label__Other   and he was being started on Epogen.
"__label__Other Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has"
"__label__Other   not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a"
__label__Other   Page 2
__label__Other   week.
"__label__Other For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate."
__label__Other Given his
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct   history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no"
__label__Other   anginal symptoms.
__label__Other Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.
__label__Other Generally weak.
__label__Other Home services
"__label__Other   now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is"
__label__Other   mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.
__label__smoker.unknown Social history: wife very involved with his care.
__label__Other Physical exam: BP 98/60.
__label__Other Pulse 64.
__label__Other Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop.
__label__Other No rub.
"__label__Other Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender."
__label__Other Multiple well healed surgical scars.
__label__Other Extremities: incisions in the groin.
__label__Other No erythema.
__label__Other Right groin several cm question cystic
__label__Other   structure beneath the incision.
"__label__Other Soft, nontender, non-erythematous."
__label__Other 2-3+ edema in the
__label__Other   extremities bilaterally.
__label__Other Dry gangrene left second toe.
__label__Other Disposition: 1.
__label__Other Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d.
__label__Other phone follow up within several days.
__label__Other 2.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Continue Percocet for toe pain.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.
"__label__Other In the meantime, will"
__label__Other   transfuse if Crit drops below 28.
__label__Other 6.
__label__Other Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o.
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
__label__Other   about end of life issues.
__label__Other Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
__label__Other   other than his single toe at this point.
"__label__Other He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a"
__label__Other   BKA.
__label__Other He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
__label__Other   the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

__label__Other 	Reason for visit:
__label__Other    Follow up visit visit
__label__Other 	Interval History:
__label__cad.mention.before_dct    60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.
__label__Other Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV."
__label__cad.event.before_dct The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).
__label__Other A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.
__label__Other There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.
__label__Other A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.
__label__Other Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.
__label__Other RV function was normal.
__label__Other He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).
__label__cad.event.before_dct He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.
"__label__Other He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted."
"__label__Other He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue."
__label__Other The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.
__label__Other LV EF 63%.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K."
__label__Other A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.
"__label__Other The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction."
__label__Other LV EF 68%.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.
__label__Other He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then."
__label__Other He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
__label__Other His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.
__label__Other Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.
__label__Other This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.
__label__Other Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.
"__label__Other He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e."
__label__Other muscolskeletal in nature).
"__label__Other He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test."
__label__Other He denies lightheadedness or syncope.
__label__Other No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.
__label__Other He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.
__label__Other He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.
__label__Other He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.
__label__Other Past medical history:
__label__cad.event.before_dct    1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).
"__label__Other Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel"

__label__Other 	EKG:
"__label__Other    Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change."
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct    60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct 1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy."
__label__Other Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e.
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..before_dct Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily."
__label__Other His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.
__label__cad.event.before_dct The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory."
__label__Other His ECG today is unchanged from priors.
"__label__Other However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms."
"__label__Other I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT."
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct 2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195."
__label__Other His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.
"__label__medication.niacin..after_dct Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan."
__label__Other He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e.
__label__Other flushing).
__label__Other He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.
"__label__Other After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs."
__label__cad.event.before_dct He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward.
__label__Other He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct 3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.
__label__Other He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

"__label__Other May 05, 2069"
__label__Other Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
__label__Other artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.
__label__Other Since the surgery she has done
__label__Other quite well.
__label__Other She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
"__label__Other 4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy"
__label__Other and also education on dietary modification.
__label__Other During her hospital
__label__Other course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
__label__Other ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
__label__Other wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
__label__Other She was
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.
__label__Other She
__label__Other also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
__label__Other Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24.
__label__Other She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
__label__Other renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit.
__label__Other Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
__label__Other diuretics.
"__label__Other Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more"
__label__Other with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.
__label__Other She is
"__label__Other not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness"
__label__Other of breath.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
__label__Other Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
__label__Other Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o.
"__label__Other q.d.,"
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o."

"__label__Other q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o."
__label__Other q. day and
__label__Other CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.
__label__Other Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
__label__Other pounds.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D."
"__label__Other 150/100, pulse is 80."
__label__Other Her skin is without any rashes or
"__label__Other ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present."
"__label__Other Heart regular rhythm,"
__label__Other distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.
"__label__Other Her lungs are clear,"
__label__Other there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
__label__Other healed.
__label__Other Her extremities are without any edema.
__label__Other Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.
__label__Other Diagnosis:
__label__cad.mention.during_dct 1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
"__label__Other 2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica"
__label__Other Page 2 
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct 3)   Diabetes mellitus.
__label__Other 4)   Anemia of chronic disease.
__label__Other 5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.
__label__Other 6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct 7)   Hypertension.
__label__obese.mention.after_dct 8)   Morbid obesity.
__label__Other Plan:
__label__cad.mention.during_dct 1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
__label__Other She is clinically
__label__Other      doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
__label__Other      or angina.
__label__Other Her ejection fraction significantly improved
__label__Other      postoperatively.
__label__Other I am concerned about a relatively high blood
__label__Other      pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct      been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.
__label__Other I will
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct      increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
__label__Other      of her potassium.
__label__Other 2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.
__label__Other Again we'll check regular labs
__label__Other      once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.
__label__Other Stable.
__label__Other Her blood pressure have been
__label__Other      under fairly good control.
__label__Other She has also lost a significant
__label__Other      amount of weight over 20 pounds.
__label__Other Her current weight is 326
__label__Other      pounds.
__label__Other We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
__label__Other We'll also recheck her blood count
__label__Other      and follow-up.
__label__Other The patient is using her CPAP
__label__Other      machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
__label__Other 6)   Hyperkalemia.
__label__Other She will continue with the Kayexalate as
__label__Other      prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
__label__Other      regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
__label__obese.mention.after_dct 7)   Morbid obesity.
__label__Other She is making good progress with her weight
__label__Other      loss.
__label__Other She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
__label__Other      weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
__label__Other      health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
"__label__Other      a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica"

__label__Other When asked where the 
__label__Other pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the

__label__Other Assessment and Plan:
__label__Other Cardiovascular.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
__label__cad.event.before_dct      his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
__label__Other      pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.
__label__Other Given that he is on 
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct      no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to "
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct      initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d.
__label__Other in an attempt to 
__label__Other      control his blood pressure and heart rate.
__label__Other I also encouraged him to 
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct      continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct      nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
__label__Other      maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.
__label__Other After he 
"__label__Other      has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an "
__label__Other      outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
__label__Other      evidence of ischemia at this time.
"__label__Other If he does, we will recommend a "
__label__Other      cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
__label__Other      causing syms of rest angina.
__label__Other The case was discussed with any 
__label__Other      cardiacs that are on call.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.before_dct      SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
__label__hyperlipidemia.high_chol..during_dct      have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
__label__Other      has at a level of 336.
__label__medication.niacin..before_dct He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
"__label__Other      the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year."
__label__Other I 
__label__Other      instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
__label__Other      diet and explained which food contain those products.
__label__Other I will also 
__label__Other      initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
__label__Other      both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.
__label__Other We will start him 
__label__medication.statin..after_dct      off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d.
__label__Other later this week.
__label__Other Daily anxiety.
__label__Other Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
__label__Other      control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
__label__Other      Ativan.
__label__Other History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.
__label__Other Patient 
__label__Other      states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
__label__Other      his next visit.
"__label__Other If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for "
__label__Other      liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

"__label__Other RE:  Parrish, Christopher "
__label__Other SFC#:  553-15-48 
__label__Other Dear Dr. Kirk:  
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today."
"__label__Other He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria."
__label__Other The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.
__label__Other An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.
"__label__Other The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized."
"__label__Other The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side."
__label__Other Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.
__label__Other There was no critical carotid stenosis.
"__label__Other He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale."
__label__Other He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.
__label__Other His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.
"__label__Other It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries."
__label__Other He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen."
"__label__Other Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months."
"__label__Other He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia."
__label__Other He has no symptoms of aphasia.
"__label__Other He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved."
__label__Other I would agree with him.
"__label__Other He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm."
__label__Other He has not had any problems with spasms.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.
__label__cad.event.before_dct His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.
__label__Other He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.
__label__Other He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.
__label__Other His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o.
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o."
"__label__Other q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o."
"__label__medication.fibrate..after_dct q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o."
"__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine."
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.
"__label__Other I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so."
__label__Other He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.
__label__Other The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.
__label__smoker.past The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.
"__label__Other There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke."
"__label__Other On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress."
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct His blood pressure was 150/90.
__label__Other His language was intact.
"__label__Other His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission."
__label__Other He was alert and oriented.
__label__Other His conversation was appropriate.
__label__Other The visual fields were full.
__label__Other The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.
__label__Other Facial sensation was normal.
__label__Other There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.
__label__Other The tongue and palate were midline.
__label__Other The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.
__label__Other There was atrophy of the left biceps.
__label__Other There was full range of motion of the joints.
"__label__Other The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors."
__label__Other The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.
__label__Other His right side was 5/5.
__label__Other He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.
__label__Other His right toe was downgoing.
__label__Other Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.
__label__Other I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.
__label__Other Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.
"__label__Other He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed."
__label__Other Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.
__label__Other He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.
__label__Other I hope that this will be the case.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement."
__label__Other I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.
__label__Other His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.
"__label__Other I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent."
__label__medication.fibrate..after_dct I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.
__label__Other The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.
__label__medication.fibrate..during_dct I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.
"__label__Other However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He should continue on an aspirin a day.
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type."
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.
__label__Other This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin."
__label__Other I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.
__label__Other I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.
"__label__Other The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination."
"__label__Other Sincerely, "

__label__Other Re:	Russell Urban	
__label__Other WRH#	4722064	
__label__Other Dear Dr. Ussery:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.
"__label__Other As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis."
__label__Other He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.
"__label__Other By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction."
"__label__Other That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia."
__label__Other He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.
"__label__Other The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall."
__label__cad.test.before_dct Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.
__label__cad.test.before_dct He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery."
__label__Other A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.
"__label__Other A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093."
__label__Other This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.
"__label__Other Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern."
__label__Other He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well."
__label__Other He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.
"__label__Other He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis."
__label__Other He has felt very well.
"__label__Other He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever."
__label__Other His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.
"__label__Other Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort."
__label__Other He was evaluated and released.
__label__Other He never had any further testing.
"__label__Other He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day."
__label__Other He has no known drug allergies.
"__label__Other Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions."
__label__Other He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.
__label__Other He has been working in Borders.
"__label__Other He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife."
__label__Other He has no children.
"__label__smoker.past He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization."
__label__Other He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.
"__label__Other On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm."
__label__Other His heart rate is 60 and regular.
"__label__Other In general, he is in no apparent distress."
__label__Other His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.
"__label__Other His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi."
__label__Other His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
"__label__Other He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops."
__label__Other His abdomen is benign.
"__label__Other His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema."
"__label__Other On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits."
"__label__Other His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits."
__label__Other His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.
__label__Other The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.
__label__Other His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_chol..before_dct His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl."
__label__Other His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
"__label__Other He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis."
__label__Other Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.
"__label__Other He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600."
__label__Other His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.
__label__cad.event.before_dct His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction.
__label__Other There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.
__label__Other His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease."
"__label__Other Also, his systolic function has improved over time."
__label__Other I think there are two processes going on.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct One is coronary artery disease.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.
"__label__Other Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this."
"__label__Other He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one."
__label__Other I suspect that this is myocarditis.
"__label__Other Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit."
__label__Other It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate."
__label__Other His LDL goal will be less than 100.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.
__label__Other I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.
__label__Other I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Ussery:
__label__Other I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.
"__label__Other Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well."
"__label__Other He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note."
"__label__Other Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation."
__label__Other He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.
__label__Other He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.
__label__smoker.past He has stopped smoking.
__label__Other There have been no difficulties with his medications.
"__label__Other On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis."
"__label__Other Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic."
__label__Other He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.
__label__Other His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.
__label__Other Medications:
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct Aspirin 325 mg daily
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct Plavix 75 mg daily 
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Lipitor 40 mg daily
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct lisinopril 10 mg daily
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Coreg 6.25 mg daily.
__label__Other Physical examination:
__label__Other He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.
__label__Other His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.
__label__Other His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.
__label__Other His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
__label__Other His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.
__label__Other He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.
__label__Other His abdomen is soft.
__label__Other It is neither tender nor distended.
__label__Other He has normal bowel sounds.
__label__Other His extremities are warm and well perfused.
__label__Other He has no edema.
__label__cad.event.before_dct Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.
"__label__Other Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction."
__label__Other The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.
__label__Other There is likely a component of left heart failure.
"__label__Other In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea."
"__label__Other He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing."
__label__Other This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.
"__label__Other Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this."
"__label__Other The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them."
"__label__Other To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study."
"__label__Other If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly."
__label__Other I will see him again in six months' time.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.
__label__Other He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure""."
__label__Other He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes.
"__label__Other There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED."
"__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG."
"__label__Other Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels."
__label__Other Stent placement was not attempted.
__label__Other His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward.
"__label__Other A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: "

__label__Other Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital.
__label__Other He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:
"__label__Other Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1."
"__label__Other Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue."
__label__Other No chest pain was    reported.
"__label__Other Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68."
"__label__Other The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2."
__label__Other See exercise report for full ECG details.
__label__Other Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.

__label__Other Dear Gray:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today.
"__label__cad.mention.after_dct As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction."
__label__Other I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.
__label__Other I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.
__label__Other The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.
__label__Other At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.
__label__Other He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal)."
__label__Other An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.
__label__Other An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent.
"__label__Other Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic."
"__label__Other Since then, he has had no further episodes."
"__label__Other ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope."
__label__Other He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved)."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening."
__label__Other This is an Equadorian formulation.
__label__Other SHx:
"__label__smoker.never He does not drink, nor smoke."
__label__Other FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60.
__label__Other Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.
"__label__Other On exam, he looks well."
__label__Other His heart rate is in the 64.
__label__Other His blood pressure was 115/70.
__label__Other His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
__label__Other His jugular venous pressures were not elevated.
__label__Other His chest was clear to auscultation.
__label__Other His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.
__label__Other His abdomen was soft.
__label__Other Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses.
__label__Other Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease."
__label__Other He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.
__label__Other I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.

"__label__Other Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely."
__label__Other Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.
"__label__Other Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly."
"__label__Other When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time."

"__label__Other Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid."
__label__Other Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great."
__label__Other so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.
"__label__Other We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction."
"__label__Other He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this."
__label__Other OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.

__label__cad.test.during_dct    A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.
__label__Other Interval History:
__label__Other    Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
__label__Other A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion.
__label__Other An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA."
__label__Other 1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased."
__label__cad.event.before_dct An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia.
__label__Other Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%.
__label__Other He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.
"__label__medication.diuretic..before_dct (BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2."
__label__Other An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%.
"__label__Other Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters."
__label__Other He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47.
"__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief."
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.
__label__cad.test.before_dct An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia.
"__label__Other He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done."
"__label__Other It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9."
"__label__Other Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held."
__label__Other He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.
__label__Other He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.
"__label__Other Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night."
__label__Other (2 liters NP)
"__label__cad.test.during_dct Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent."

__label__Other Clear bilaterally.
__label__Other CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 
__label__Other murmurs.
__label__Other ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
__label__Other EXTREMITIES:  Normal.
__label__Other GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here.
__label__Other LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 
__label__Other was 160.

"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture."
__label__Other Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies.
"__label__Other She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema."
__label__Other Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively.

"__label__Other PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal."
__label__Other There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator.
__label__Other The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit.
__label__Other Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated.
"__label__Other Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed."
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial.
"__label__Other It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed."
"__label__Other In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab."
"__label__Other Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture."
__label__Other There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either.
__label__Other I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her.
__label__Other I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma.
__label__Other We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.

__label__Other Re:  William Potts
__label__Other      MR#  109-16-75-8
__label__Other Dear Matt:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.
__label__Other As you
"__label__Other know, he recently had a complicated hospital course."
__label__Other He underwent
"__label__Other cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD"
__label__cad.test.before_dct including 70% and 90% stenoses.
__label__Other The first marginal branch had a
__label__Other 60% ostial stenosis.
__label__Other The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
"__label__Other stenoses, respectively."
__label__Other The PDA had a 70% narrowing.
__label__Other Given his
"__label__Other very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to"
__label__Other proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
__label__Other the obtuse marginal.
"__label__Other It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,"
__label__Other and not worth going after at this time.
__label__Other The RCA was successfully
"__label__cad.event.before_dct stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left"
__label__Other ventricular branch.
"__label__Other By the end of the procedure, flow had been"
"__label__Other restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,"
__label__Other but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
__label__Other infarction.
__label__Other Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
"__label__Other branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated."
__label__Other Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure.
__label__Other The second
__label__Other exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.
__label__Other He exercised for
"__label__Other nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest"
__label__Other pain.
__label__Other He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
__label__Other of 121.
__label__Other MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
__label__Other infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.
__label__Other There was
__label__Other moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
__label__Other territory of the RCA.
"__label__Other Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts"
__label__Other undergo bypass surgery.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,"
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d."
__label__Other He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
__label__Other Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
__label__Other recently.
__label__Other His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
__label__Other William Potts
"__label__Other MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070"
__label__Other from a hip fracture.
__label__Other He is having difficulty arranging the
__label__Other appropriate insurance to cover her medications.
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.
__label__Other This
"__label__Other occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest"
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct and/or 1 nitroglycerin.
__label__Other He has decreased his work level
"__label__Other considerably, and is relatively sedentary."
"__label__Other On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress."
__label__Other He had
"__label__Other a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60."
__label__Other His weight
__label__Other was 203 pounds.
__label__Other Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI"
"__label__Other with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops."
__label__Other Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
"__label__Other His abdomen is soft,"
__label__Other nontender.
"__label__Other There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux."
__label__Other Extremities are without edema.
__label__Other Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61.
"__label__Other Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees."
__label__Other There are
__label__Other flipped T-waves in III and AVF.
__label__Other I did not have an old
__label__Other electrocardiogram here for comparison.
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with"
__label__Other mild exertion.
__label__Other He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
__label__Other surgery.
__label__Other He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
"__label__Other by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this."
__label__Other There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
__label__Other return to work as an actor.
__label__Other Given Mr. Potts's current
"__label__Other feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon"
__label__Other as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
__label__Other It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
"__label__Other year-old mother at home, along with his wife."
__label__Other His mother currently
"__label__Other uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot"
__label__Other exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
__label__Other the house.
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct He understands this, and if his chest pain should"
"__label__Other become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately"
__label__Other call me.
"__label__Other If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two"
__label__Other weeks at NDNH.
__label__Other With best regards.

__label__Other Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg
__label__Other HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.
__label__Other He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.
__label__Other He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot.
__label__Other There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78.
__label__Other He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well.
__label__Other The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.
__label__Other No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.
"__label__Other During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed."
__label__Other The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.
__label__Other The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.

__label__Other CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
__label__Other numerous complaints.
__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
__label__Other since her upper respiratory tract infection.
__label__Other She had the flu in January 
__label__Other and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
__label__Other weeks ago.
__label__Other She states that this has severely debilitated her.
__label__Other She is 
"__label__Other complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and "
__label__Other occasional dull headache.
"__label__Other However, her main concern is her stomach and "
__label__Other her back.
__label__Other Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
"__label__Other in her epigastrium, particularly after eating."
__label__Other This is different than her 
"__label__Other reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the "
__label__Other Prilosec-Propulsid combination.
"__label__Other She is describing some anorexia, although "
__label__Other she has not lost any weight.
__label__Other She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
__label__Other movements.
__label__Other She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.
__label__Other She wonders 
__label__Other whether this could be in gallbladder.
"__label__Other In addition, she is continuing to "
__label__Other have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
__label__Other distribution.
__label__Other She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
__label__Other back.
"__label__Other Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed."
__label__Other She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.
__label__Other Her sugars 
"__label__Other have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143."
__label__Other Her blood 
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70."
__label__Other She is saturating well.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation."
__label__Other There was no JVD.
"__label__Other Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ?"
__label__Other S3 
__label__Other with no significant murmur.
"__label__Other Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some "
__label__Other mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.
__label__Other Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.
__label__Other Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, "
__label__Other and cerebrovascular disease.
__label__Other She came in today for discussion of her 
__label__Other ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
"__label__Other With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with "
"__label__Other codeine, which has helped in the past."
__label__Other I gave her a prescription.
__label__Other I 
__label__Other warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.
__label__Other She should 
"__label__Other contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural "
__label__Other steroid injection.
"__label__Other With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, "
__label__Other postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
__label__Other disease.
__label__Other Unclear contribution from her reflux.
__label__Other Dr. Mario Robison 
__label__Other recommended elective cholecystectomy.
__label__Other Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
"__label__Other being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to "
__label__Other page 2 
__label__Other consider her for the surgery.
__label__Other I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
__label__Other make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
__label__Other make an informed decision about the surgery.
__label__Other She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
__label__Other a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.
__label__Other She would probably do better 
__label__Other with lower blood pressure.
__label__Other We could consider increasing her Imdur.
__label__Other I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

"__label__Other REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D."
__label__cad.event.during_dct Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.
"__label__medication.insulin..during_dct She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension."
"__label__Other She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort."
"__label__Other She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath."
__label__Other She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.
__label__Other There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.
"__label__Other She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure."
__label__Other She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.
__label__Other The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.
__label__cad.event.during_dct The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.
__label__Other She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.
__label__Other She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.
__label__Other Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.
__label__Other She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct and atenolol 50 mg q.d.
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.
__label__Other Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.
__label__smoker.never Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
__label__Other She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.
"__label__Other Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular."
__label__Other Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.
__label__Other Head and neck were unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__cad.event.during_dct Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
__label__cad.event.during_dct PMI is normal.
__label__Other S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.
__label__Other There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.
__label__Other There is no S3.
__label__Other Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.
__label__Other Bowel sounds are normal.
__label__Other Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
__label__Other Calf site is clean without bruits.
__label__Other Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.
__label__cad.event.during_dct Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.
"__label__Other Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000."
__label__Other Liver function tests are normal.
__label__Other A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.
__label__cad.event.during_dct Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.
"__label__cad.event.during_dct She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved."
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates."
"__label__Other We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.
"__label__Other At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery."

__label__Other RE:  Jennifer Vance
__label__Other      MR #542-66-00-3
__label__Other Dear Vester:
__label__Other Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac
__label__Other evaluation.
"__label__Other As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it"
__label__Other briefly for our records.
__label__Other Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with
"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and"
__label__cad.mention.during_dct significant coronary artery disease.
"__label__Other In 2061, after a four to five"
"__label__Other day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to"
__label__Other the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography
__label__Other revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.
__label__cad.event.during_dct She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with
__label__Other inadequate results.
__label__Other She therefore was taken electively for
__label__cad.event.during_dct coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left
__label__Other internal mammary artery to her LAD.
__label__Other She subsequently continued to
__label__Other have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization
__label__Other in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%
__label__Other stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%
__label__Other stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
__label__Other The catheterization
__label__Other report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary
__label__Other artery graft.
"__label__Other Since then, she has continued to have episodes of"
__label__Other intermittent abdominal discomfort.
__label__Other She recently has undergone an
__label__Other extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her
__label__Other abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.
__label__Other Trials
__label__Other of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective.
"__label__Other In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test"
"__label__Other exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak"
__label__Other blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.
__label__Other She had no
__label__Other ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.
__label__Other Over the past two weeks
"__label__Other however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome"
__label__Other (which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now
__label__Other includes radiation to her left shoulder.
__label__Other The pain is not
"__label__Other exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity."
__label__Other The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest.
"__label__Other Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a"
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164."
"__label__Other Vance, Jennifer"

__label__Other dying from melanoma age 36.

__label__Other supple.
__label__Other JVP flat.
__label__Other Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right
__label__Other greater than left bruits.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam shows a
"__label__Other normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection"
"__label__Other murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant"
__label__Other diastolic murmur.
__label__Other The abdomen is benign.
__label__Other Extremities reveal no
__label__Other appreciable edema.
__label__Other Peripheral pulses are intact.
__label__Other Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.
__label__Other PR interval
"__label__Other of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees."
__label__Other There are minor
__label__Other nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
__label__Other Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and"
__label__cad.mention.during_dct dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.
__label__Other She has had a
__label__Other retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her
__label__Other most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show
__label__Other significant provokable ischemia.
"__label__Other Nonetheless, I am concerned that"
__label__Other her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia.
__label__Other I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and
__label__Other I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive
__label__Other studies.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.before_dct In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive"
__label__Other antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.
__label__Other Unless her variegata porphyria
"__label__Other precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po"
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.
__label__Other In
"__label__Other addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d."
__label__Other and
__label__Other I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her
__label__Other porphyria does not

__label__Other preclude this.
__label__Other She understands that if she has evidence for
__label__Other significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her
__label__Other to undergo repeat coronary angiography.

"__label__Other It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089."
"__label__Other Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms."
"__label__Other When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy."
"__label__Other At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms."
__label__Other Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.
__label__Other Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.
__label__Other He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.
"__label__Other He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation."
"__label__Other From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath."

__label__Other Assessment and plan:
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct    Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication."
__label__Other Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.
"__label__Other Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089."
"__label__Other On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes."
"__label__Other Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e."
"__label__Other CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted."
"__label__Other Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted."
__label__Other It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.
"__label__Other Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree."
__label__Other We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.
__label__Other He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.
__label__Other He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.
"__label__Other With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities."
"__label__Other Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss."
__label__Other We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Cooper:
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct   I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease."
"__label__Other Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago."
"__label__Other This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf."
"__label__Other The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset."
__label__Other They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.
"__label__Other While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living."
"__label__Other He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively."
__label__Other The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight."
"__label__Other He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet."
__label__Other He is struggling with the decision.
"__label__Other I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so."
"__label__Other In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler."
"__label__Other Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill."
__label__Other He has no ulcers or gangrene.
"__label__Other From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well."
"__label__Other He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia."
"__label__Other While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease."
"__label__Other He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results."
"__label__Other Otherwise, Chris is doing great."
__label__Other We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.
__label__Other We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.
"__label__Other If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation."
"__label__Other Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same."
__label__Other Other Data:
"__label__Other    I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note."
__label__Other We will send this along to you as well.

"__label__Other Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial."
__label__Other S/P Rt TMA.
__label__Other Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.
__label__Other By issue:
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct 1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance."
__label__Other The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management.
"__label__Other If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option."
"__label__Other In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis."
"__label__Other Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx."
"__label__Other I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture."
"__label__Other If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration."
__label__Other 2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start.
"__label__Other He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes."
__label__Other Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx.
__label__Other Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior.
__label__Other Might hold ranitidine as well.
__label__Other Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc.
__label__Other Currently on olanzapine.
__label__Other Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged.
__label__Other Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.
__label__Other 3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound.
__label__Other Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status.
__label__Other All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative.
__label__Other Would seek ID input to the end.
__label__Other Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future.

__label__Other He is doing well.
__label__Other He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes.
__label__Other He is currently not anticoagulated.
"__label__Other Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70."
__label__Other He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week.
"__label__Other If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen."
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75.
__label__Other The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male.

__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and
__label__Other recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise
__label__Other syndrome and back/chest pain.
__label__Other Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.
__label__Other She was found to have a blood
__label__Other pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent
__label__Other headaches.
__label__Other She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being
__label__Other found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.
__label__Other She was transferred to the

"__label__Other Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy."
"__label__Other Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar"
"__label__Other puncture, both of which were negative."
__label__Other Electroencephalogram was  performed and
__label__Other showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.
__label__Other The patient's

"__label__Other physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility."
__label__Other A
__label__Other specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that
__label__Other this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with
__label__Other use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her
__label__Other threshold for seizure activity.

__label__Other infarction in 2067.

__label__Other yards before getting very short of breath.
__label__Other He has no orthopnea or PND.
__label__Other He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Health maintenance.
__label__Other We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
__label__Other flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.
"__label__Other has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop "
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
__label__Other checked on the day prior to the test.
__label__Other This will be scheduled by our 
__label__Other secretary.
__label__Other He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
__label__Other standard dose and titrate up slowly.

__label__Other his feet appeared well.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, "
"__label__Other including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid."
__label__Other PLAN:
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, "
"__label__Other including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia "
"__label__Other and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care."
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
__label__Other left the other doses as is.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
__label__Other and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
__label__Other 4.
"__label__Other We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7."
__label__Other 5.

__label__Other He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.
__label__Other In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.
__label__Other He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.
"__label__Other On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89."

__label__Other Complete Cardiovascular Exam:.
__label__Other BP 100 50/65.

__label__Other He has no rales.
"__label__Other He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3."
__label__Other He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.
"__label__Other EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA"
__label__Other Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.
__label__Other He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.
__label__Other I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.
__label__medication.statin..after_dct Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.
__label__Other I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.
__label__Other Of course the catheterization will determine that.
__label__Other He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

__label__Other Impression:
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology."
__label__Other The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.
"__label__Other Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP."
"__label__Other However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered."
"__label__Other Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient."
"__label__Other While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis."
"__label__Other I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note."
"__label__Other My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP."
"__label__Other An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious)."
"__label__Other Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated."
__label__Other We recommend the following work-up:
__label__Other -Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
__label__Other -Induced sputum for
__label__Other -PCP
__label__Other -Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
__label__Other -Fungal stain and culture
__label__Other -Urine histo antigen
__label__Other -Serum cryptococcal antigen
__label__Other -Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
"__label__Other -Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture"
"__label__Other If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later."
"__label__Other It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol)."
__label__Other Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.
__label__Other Thank you for this consult.

__label__Other HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
__label__obese.mention.after_dct 44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.
"__label__Other She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated "
__label__Other creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
__label__Other evaluation.
"__label__Other The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as "
__label__Other planned.
"__label__Other She states that she has been ""too busy."""
__label__Other Her only complaint 
"__label__Other today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is "
__label__Other relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.
__label__Other A noted in her 
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d."
"__label__Other drug, however, "
__label__Other Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
__label__Other on an almost p.r.n.
__label__Other basis.
__label__Other Review of systems is essentially normal.
"__label__Other Specifically, she denies any "
"__label__Other headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath."
__label__Other She also denies any 
__label__Other symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.
__label__Other She has no history of 
"__label__Other dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria."
__label__Other Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.
__label__Other Vital signs are 
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.
__label__Other HEENT exam is unremarkable.
__label__Other Lungs are clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal "
"__label__Other S1, S2."
__label__Other No S3 is appreciated.
__label__Other There are no murmurs or rubs.
__label__Other Abdomen is 
"__label__Other slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds."
__label__Other No masses are 
__label__Other appreciated.
__label__Other Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
__label__Other suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.
"__label__Other Indeed, exam of "
__label__Other her legs is entirely unremarkable.
"__label__Other Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine "
__label__Other sediment and a urine creatinine.
__label__Other Assessment and Plan:
__label__Other 1.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct      on her Procardia.
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which "
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct      she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, "
__label__Other      beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.
__label__Other I will see her in a few days in order 
__label__Other      to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
__label__Other      and also to check her blood pressure once again.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
"__label__Other      related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the "
__label__Other      hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)
__label__Other I  have asked her to continue taking 
"__label__Other      Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, "
__label__Other      such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.
__label__Other Page 2                                        29195561
__label__Other 3.
"__label__smoker.unknown Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal "
__label__Other      appointment.
"__label__Other In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I "
__label__Other      have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.
__label__Other She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
__label__Other      also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.
"__label__Other Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this "
__label__Other      elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
__label__Other      function.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
"__label__Other      today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long."""
__label__Other She is to see me 
"__label__Other      again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time."
__label__Other Her 
__label__Other      February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
__label__Other      will not be repeated until next year.

"__label__Other Galena, MN  64864"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Trujillo:
"__label__Other Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady"
"__label__Other with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do"
__label__Other revascularization of the right leg.
__label__Other Her history is well known to
__label__Other you but I will repeat it for our records.
__label__Other She has a long history
__label__smoker.past of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30
"__label__Other years, stopping 15 years ago."
"__label__Other She has developed claudication,"
"__label__Other particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her"
"__label__Other husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved"
__label__Other by rest.
__label__Other This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also
__label__Other in the right thigh as well.
__label__Other She had segmental leg pressures done
__label__Other which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an
__label__Other ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.
__label__Other An MR angiogram
"__label__Other showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this"
__label__Other as yet.
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes
"__label__Other mellitus, which she has had for 10 years."
__label__Other Her other cardiac risk
__label__smoker.past factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of
"__label__Other myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her"
__label__Other cholesterol level is.
"__label__Other She has no history of hypertension,"
__label__Other although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the
__label__Other past.
__label__Other She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for
__label__Other a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in
__label__Other swallowing tablets and keeping them down.
__label__Other She also has a past
__label__Other history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma
__label__Other that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive
__label__Other therapy.
"__label__Other She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was"
__label__Other uneventful.
"__label__Other Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,"
"__label__Other palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,"
"__label__Other weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual"
"__label__Other disturbances, and all other systems are negative."
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin"
__label__Other only.
__label__Other She has no allergies.
"__label__Other On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any"
"__label__Other signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis."
__label__Other Her heart rate was 85
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms.
"__label__Other The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid"
"__label__Other upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible."
__label__Other Her apex
"__label__Other beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second"
"__label__Other heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops."
__label__Other Her chest
__label__Other was clear to percussion and auscultation.
__label__Other She had no
__label__Other hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.
__label__Other She
__label__Other had the scars from previous operations present.
__label__Other Her femoral
__label__Other pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side
__label__Other without bruits.
__label__Other She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and
__label__Other posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on
__label__Other the right leg.
__label__Other There were no trophic changes in her legs.
__label__Other had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf
__label__Other level in a stocking distribution.
__label__Other Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.
__label__Other Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and
"__label__Other requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any"
__label__Other myocardial ischemia.
__label__Other I therefore think a stress test is
__label__Other required.
__label__Other She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and
__label__Other this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her
"__label__Other atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate."
__label__Other Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess
__label__Other for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.
__label__Other I have also
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing
"__label__Other her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,"
__label__Other which is elevated.
__label__Other I have also asked her to have a fasting blood
"__label__Other lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is"
__label__Other likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.
__label__Other I
__label__Other plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after
__label__Other her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.
__label__Other I will let you know the results of her stress test when they
__label__Other become available.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to take part in this
__label__Other lady's care.
"__label__Other Yours sincerely,"

__label__Other No other masses are palpable.
__label__Other The lower extremities are free of edema.
"__label__Other I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink."

"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM."
__label__Other She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).
"__label__Other She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE."
"__label__Other Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic."
__label__Other She had persistent nausea and vomiting.
__label__Other Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.
"__label__Other She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds."
__label__Other Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.
"__label__diabetes.glucose.during_dct She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology."

__label__Other Dear Dr. Pearson: 
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning.
__label__Other Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis.
"__label__Other She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent."
__label__Other Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.
__label__Other Interval History
__label__Other Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago.
"__label__Other She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair."
"__label__Other She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties."
"__label__Other Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy."
"__label__Other According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year."
__label__Other Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96.
__label__Other Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months.
__label__Other A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma.
__label__Other This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent.
"__label__Other She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters."
__label__Other Her other children have not maintained close contact.
"__label__Other Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time."
"__label__Other Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094."

"__label__Other Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension)."
__label__Other 5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg.
__label__Other SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left.
"__label__Other DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left."
__label__Other Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally.
"__label__Other Right plantar response extensor, left flexor."
__label__Other CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger.
__label__Other MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 
"__label__Other CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation."
__label__Other CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel
"__label__Other Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities."
__label__Other Impression
__label__Other Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque."
__label__Other She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now.
__label__Other Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression.
__label__Other Plan
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
__label__Other 2.
"__label__Other We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control."
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
__label__Other 3.
"__label__Other Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy."
"__label__Other Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl."
__label__Other I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep.
"__label__Other After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS."
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.
__label__Other It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you.
__label__Other Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues.
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.

"__label__Other Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review"

__label__Other was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia.
__label__Other This was treated with
__label__medication.metformin..during_dct Metformin.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct he has been diagnosed with hypertension).
__label__Other He subsequently developed
__label__medication.metformin..after_dct diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
__label__Other subsequently reduced in dose.
__label__Other In June of the past year the patient
__label__Other was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his

__label__Other traveled to trinidad and tobago.
__label__Other While in trinidad and tobago he had a

__label__Other found it difficult to ambulate.
__label__Other He denied any difficulty with chest
__label__Other pains or shortness of breath.
__label__Other He had no hemoptysis and no focal
__label__Other unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
__label__Other during the trip.
__label__Other He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
__label__Other ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
__label__Other significantly.
"__label__Other However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this"
__label__Other medication and it was stopped.
__label__Other Subsequently his lower extremity has
__label__Other once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of

"__label__Other He has no chest pain, has no cough, no"
"__label__Other sputum production, no hemoptysis."
__label__Other He has no fevers or chills.
__label__Other believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
__label__Other months.
__label__Other He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation.
__label__Other denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
__label__Other that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
__label__Other often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him.
__label__Other denies any history of snoring.
__label__Other He has noted no new joint complaints
__label__Other although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of

__label__Other This has been

__label__Other The thyroid gland is normal.
__label__Other Jugular venous distention to

__label__Other was noted.
__label__Other Neck was supple.
__label__Other Examination of the
__label__Other chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
__label__Other at both bases.
__label__Other There was no egophony and no wheezes.
__label__Other Otherwise the
__label__Other lungs were clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,"
"__label__Other normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated."
__label__Other No RV heave
__label__Other or lift was appreciated.
__label__Other No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
__label__Other The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced.
__label__Other No appreciable
__label__Other murmurs were detected.
__label__Other The point of maximum impulse was in the
__label__Other anterior axillary line.
__label__Other Examination of the abdomen revealed a
"__label__Other nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths"
__label__Other below the right costal margin.
__label__Other This was nontender and smooth.
__label__Other Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well.

__label__Other There was trace
__label__Other MR with moderate TR.
__label__Other A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
__label__Other right atrial pressure was noted.
__label__Other In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct pulmonary hypertension.
__label__Other The etiology of this is not clear at the
__label__Other moment.
__label__Other Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
"__label__Other disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive"
"__label__Other sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease."
__label__Other In addition some
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
__label__Other setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
__label__Other ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
__label__Other exclusion.
__label__Other The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
__label__Other with increasing his diuretic regimen.
__label__Other I'm embarking on a course of
__label__Other evaluation to exclude the most likely causes.
__label__Other In specific he will
__label__Other be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
__label__Other disease this afternoon.
__label__Other This has already been arranged by Dr.
__label__Other Faust.
"__label__Other In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an"
__label__Other antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70.
__label__Other I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
__label__Other Page 4
__label__Other to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea.
__label__Other will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
__label__Other pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
__label__Other arterial blood gas drawn.
"__label__Other If this evaluation should be unrevealing,"
__label__Other he may require more invasive diagnostics.
__label__Other I've already consulted
"__label__Other formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most"
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
__label__Other be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
__label__Other workup is nondiagnostic.
"__label__Other Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation."
__label__Other I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
__label__Other his diagnostic tests have been performed.
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to
__label__Other call me with any further questions or concerns.

"__label__Other Dear Hicks,"
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.
"__label__Other She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy."
"__label__Other As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery."
__label__Other She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease."
__label__Other She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.
"__label__Other Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066."
"__label__Other It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago."
__label__Other She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.
__label__Other You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.
__label__Other Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.
"__label__Other She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope."
__label__family_hist.present She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.
__label__cad.event.before_dct She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.
__label__cad.mention.during_dct She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.
"__label__Other In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever."
"__label__Other Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise."
__label__Other She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.
__label__Other She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation."
"__label__Other She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet."
"__label__smoker.past She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s."
__label__Other She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.
"__label__family_hist.present As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s."
"__label__Other On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds."
"__label__Other In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest."
__label__Other She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.
__label__Other She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.
__label__Other Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.
__label__Other Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
"__label__Other Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border."
__label__Other Her abdomen is benign.
__label__Other She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.
"__label__Other Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe."
"__label__Other Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses."
"__label__Other In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT."
__label__Other An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.
__label__Other There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft."
__label__Other She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.
"__label__cad.mention.during_dct However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction."
"__label__Other As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery."
"__label__Other Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period."
"__label__Other During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60."
__label__Other I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.
__label__Other We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.
"__label__Other If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI."
__label__Other I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.
"__label__Other As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results."
__label__cad.mention.during_dct This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.
__label__Other It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.
__label__Other We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.
__label__Other Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Schmidt:
"__label__smoker.unknown Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today."
"__label__Other As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease."
"__label__Other She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078."
__label__Other She has done well since the procedure.
__label__Other She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.
"__label__Other She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did."
__label__Other She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.
"__label__Other On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress."
__label__Other She is alert and oriented x3.
__label__Other She appears grossly neurologically intact.
__label__Other Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.
__label__Other Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.
__label__Other This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.
__label__Other It remains superficial.
__label__Other She has no other ischemic skin changes noted.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.
__label__Other She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.
__label__Other She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.
__label__Other I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.
__label__Other She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.
__label__Other She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen.
"__label__Other If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me."

"__label__Other Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise."
"__label__Other She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission."
"__label__Other The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis."
__label__Other Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.
__label__Other She should not receive diuretics at present.
__label__Other Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.
"__label__Other I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first."
"__label__Other The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease."
__label__Other We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.
__label__Other The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.
__label__Other Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.
__label__Other Suggest:
"__label__medication.arb.diuretic.during_dct Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted."
__label__Other IV normal saline.
"__label__Other May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach."
"__label__Other Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels."
"__label__Other Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct."
__label__Other Agree with check echocardiogram.
__label__Other We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.
__label__Other Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

"
__label__Other SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.
__label__Other Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.

__label__Other Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.
__label__Other With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.
__label__Other Continue IVF while NPO

"__label__Other Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30."
__label__Other She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
__label__Other She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.
__label__Other Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.
__label__Other Transfuse 1U PRBCs
__label__Other Check colostomy guaiac

__label__Other Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.
__label__Other She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.

__label__Other Another daughter is staying with the
__label__Other patient full-time.
__label__Other Visiting nurse is involved.
__label__Other Previous to
"__label__Other the last few months, the patient was fairly independent."
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
"__label__Other GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady"
"__label__Other on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly"
__label__Other and carefully.
"__label__Other Has a cane, but does not always use it."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),"

__label__Other HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
__label__Other No murmurs.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
__label__Other Weight loss.
__label__Other Probably due to poor caloric intake.
__label__Other This
"__label__Other is a significant health concern for her, as she has become"
__label__Other progressively cachectic and weak.
__label__Other This is probably
"__label__Other attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia."
"__label__Other She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on"
__label__Other Tuesday.
__label__Other I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
__label__Other that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
"__label__Other of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate."
__label__Other She should continue to take p.o.
"__label__Other foods as tolerated, but she"
"__label__Other needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,"
__label__Other since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.
__label__Other Will try Glucerna
__label__Other because of her diabetes history.
__label__Other The patient's daughter and
__label__Other the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
"__label__Other Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees"
__label__Other Nutrition Clinic in two days.
__label__Other Cerebrovascular disease.
__label__Other Followed closely by Neurology.
__label__Other No acute change in neuro status today.
__label__Other Will continue
__label__Other Coumadin.
__label__Other Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
__label__Other this.
__label__Other Recent INR 1.4.
__label__Other Will adjust Coumadin as advised by

__label__medication.sulfonylureas..during_dct Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
__label__Other Finger-sticks three to four times daily.
__label__Other Further
__label__Other adjustments PRN.
__label__Other Our current goal is simply to maintain her
__label__Other sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.
__label__Other Once her
"__label__Other dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly"
__label__Other tighter control.
"__label__Other Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her"
__label__Other troubles with p.o.
__label__Other intake.
__label__Other Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.
__label__Other Daughter
"__label__Other will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will"
__label__Other take it from there.
__label__Other Constipation.
__label__Other Continue Colace.
__label__Other Add Dulcolax PRN.
__label__Other Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.
__label__Other If she does
"__label__Other have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and"
__label__Other her ability to eat successfully.
__label__Other Currently in reasonable control.
__label__Other Goal BP
"__label__Other 140 to 170, systolic."
__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct Initial severe hypertension this
"__label__Other visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue"
__label__Other for her.
__label__Other Follow-up at next visit.
__label__Other Followed by Psychiatry.
__label__Other Extensive reassurance
__label__Other given today to the patient.
__label__Other She is very concerned about her
"__label__Other weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would"
__label__Other take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion.
__label__Other Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd
__label__Other watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
__label__Other Multiple other issues.
__label__Other To be addressed at further
__label__Other visits.
"__label__Other Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see"
"__label__Other her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN."
"__label__Other Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me."

__label__Other Last
__label__Other week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
__label__Other It was a very very windy day.
__label__Other Afterwards she was outside and a
__label__Other huge gust of wind knocked her over.
__label__Other Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
__label__Other her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
__label__Other the wind blew.
"__label__Other There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss"
"__label__Other of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode."
"__label__Other She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and"
__label__Other left eyebrow.
__label__Other She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
__label__Other CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
__label__Other lateral edge of her left eyebrow.
__label__Other She had films of her wrist and
__label__Other hips both of which were fine.
__label__Other She has bruising in these areas.
__label__Other Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
__label__Other back to normal.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct She had marked hypertension up to 250.
__label__Other She was treated with
"__label__Other hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with"
__label__Other some hematuria.
__label__Other Her blood pressure at home since then has been
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct 180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.
__label__Other She
__label__Other is not on a beta-blocker currently.
__label__Other She has not had any episodes
__label__Other of chest pain.
__label__Other She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.

"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,"
__label__Other weight 148 pounds.
__label__Other GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
__label__Other HEENT: PERRL.
__label__Other Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
__label__Other eyebrow is easily removed.
__label__Other No evidence of any infection.
__label__Other Her
__label__Other left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
__label__Other shoulder.
__label__Other Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
__label__Other bony step-offs.
__label__Other She walks well with no pain in her left hip.
__label__Other There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
__label__Other bursa.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
__label__Other bruising but no more serious complications.
__label__Other Fortunately she did
__label__Other not have intracranial bleeding.
__label__Other I am not sure why her blood
"__label__Other pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the"
__label__Other falls verses independent causes.
__label__Other Given that the high blood
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o."
"__label__Other q.d.,"
__label__Other and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
__label__Other see how well this is working.
__label__Other Goal BP 140-160 systolic.
__label__Other urine was checked today.
__label__Other Hematuria has resolved.
__label__Other She has 2+
__label__Other proteinuria.
__label__Other I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct her hypertension.
__label__Other We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
__label__Other and benefits of Coumadin therapy.
__label__Other Although she is at risk for
"__label__Other falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the"
__label__Other Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke.
"__label__Other She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and"
__label__Other that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke.
__label__Other I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
__label__Other hemorrhage and its consequences.
__label__Other I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
"__label__Other month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be"
"__label__Other working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at"
__label__Other increased risk for falls.
__label__Other It seems to me that she is in a gray
__label__Other area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
__label__Other for Coumadin for her.
__label__Other She feels very strongly that she wishes to
__label__Other continue.
__label__Other This was discussed in detail with her and her
"__label__Other daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision."
__label__Other I
__label__Other encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
__label__Other strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall.
__label__Other More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
__label__Other counseling and education.

__label__Other This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.

"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia."

"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing."
__label__Other I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.
__label__Other I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.
"__label__Other I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease."
__label__Other I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.
"__label__Other I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology."
"__label__Other Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes."
"__label__Other I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year."
__label__Other This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.

__label__Other DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.
__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.
__label__Other The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.
"__label__Other In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning."
__label__Other There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.
"__label__Other This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed."
__label__Other The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.
"__label__Other She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured."
__label__Other The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.
__label__Other She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.
__label__Other The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.
__label__Other Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.
"__label__Other Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50."
__label__Other There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.
"__label__Other On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings."
__label__Other MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.
__label__Other The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.
__label__Other MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.
__label__Other Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.
"__label__Other Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup."
__label__Other It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.
__label__Other Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.
__label__Other Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.
__label__Other There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.
__label__Other The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.
__label__Other There are no medication allergies reported.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?."
"__label__smoker.current Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke."
__label__Other She uses alcohol occasionally.
__label__Other She has a 12th grade education.
__label__Other She lives alone and is a widow.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20."
__label__obese.mention.before_dct The patient is overweight.
__label__Other Height is 5 foot 3 inches.
__label__Other Weight is 217 pounds.
"__label__Other Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm."
__label__Other Poor neck posture is noted.
__label__Other Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.
"__label__Other Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits."
__label__Other Temporal arteries are normal.
"__label__Other Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years."
__label__Other Romberg is negative.
__label__Other Tandem gait is normal.
"__label__Other The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia."
__label__Other There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.
__label__Other This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.
__label__Other There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.
"__label__Other NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information."
"__label__Other Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive."
__label__Other Extraocular movements are full.
__label__Other Visual fields are intact.
"__label__Other There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological."
__label__Other Hearing is intact.
__label__Other Oropharynx is normal.
__label__Other Palate elevates well.
__label__Other Tongue is midline.
__label__Other Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.
__label__Other Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.
__label__Other There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.
__label__Other Coordination testing today seemed intact.
__label__Other Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.
"__label__Other Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten."
"__label__Other Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12."
"__label__Other IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology."
__label__Other Comment.
__label__Other I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.
__label__Other I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.
__label__Other Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.
"__label__Other In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant."
__label__Other It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.
"__label__Other PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.
__label__Other We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.
__label__Other We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.
"__label__Other It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both."
"__label__Other For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily."
__label__Other I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.
__label__Other She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.
__label__Other We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

"__label__Other Dear Robert, "
"__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee, a 51-year-old female patient with the history of seizure disorder, hypertension, borderline diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms, and depressive disorder, who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent polysomnographic abnormalities."
"__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As you already know, Ms. Mckee describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses, and describes a ""restless sleep"", but only relatively recently (over the last five months, particularly after 12/26 of last year)."
__label__Other She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.
"__label__Other She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves ""sleeping around the clock"" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration."
__label__Other The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.
"__label__Other She states that she is so tired that she can ""fall asleep right after breakfast""."
__label__Other She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.
"__label__Other Ms. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy."
"__label__Other She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m."
__label__Other and three tablets po q.h.s.
"__label__Other While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of ""diffuse"" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below)."
"__label__medication.diuretic..during_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Celexa, Zestril, Prilosec, carbamazepine (200 mg tablets, four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night), clonazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, Premarin, tetracycline and klor-con."
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  No adverse drug allergies reported.
"__label__Other SLEEP HISTORY:  Sleep onset intended for 11:00 p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.  She describes one to two early morning awakenings, with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance."
__label__Other Sleep offset initially occurs at 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and sometimes as late as 10:00 a.m.
__label__Other The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration (up to four hours).
"__label__Other The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness, will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep."
__label__Other Patient may sleep until 3:00 p.m. on certain given afternoons.
"__label__Other The patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as ""restless"" sleep."
__label__Other She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder.
__label__Other She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms.

__label__smoker.never SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies active tobacco use.
__label__Other She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease.
__label__Other She averages two cups of tea per day.
"__label__Other While describing an overweight status, she has increased her weight by 10-20 pounds over the past four years."
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies."
__label__Other Speech is clear and fluent.
__label__Other Receptive language functioning essentially intact.
__label__Other No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
__label__Other No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted.
__label__Other No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
"__label__Other The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias."
__label__Other No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
"__label__Other No acute evidence of ""microsleeps"" are noted."
"__label__Other On HEENT examination, there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal apeture, with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula, as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Vital signs include a blood pressure of 144/88 (seated, left arm) and a heart rate of 88, with a respiratory rate of 14."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  
__label__Other Hypersomnia (780.54):  Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals.
__label__Other Other diagnostic possibilities include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy (although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy).
__label__Other Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (780.53):  Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of 26 per hour as noted during a recent 3/26/27 sleep study with associated O2 desaturations down to 76 percent.
__label__Other Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted.
"__label__Other Seizure disorder:  Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy."
__label__Other PLAN:  
"__label__Other Suggest regular home CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure)."
"__label__Other Pending clinical response, will reassess the patient's level of alertness, decrease amount of early morning awakenings, and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in 12-14 weeks times."
"__label__Other In addition, patient is advised to continue efforts at weight reduction, use of an oro-dental, and/or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms."
"__label__Other Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m."
__label__Other until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made.
__label__Other Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in 12-14 weeks time.
"__label__Other Once again, thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee."
__label__Other I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.
"__label__Other Sincerely, "

__label__Other Department of Sleep Studies 
__label__Other ADDENDUM:  Sleep study results (3/26/27):  
"__label__Other Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive (82) and partially obstructive apneas (63) during supine sleep, as well as intermittent hypopneas (19) and nocturnal hypoventilations, intermittent snore arousals (4) and episodes of moderate snoring (respiratory disturbance index = 26 per hour) with associated arousals and O2 desaturations down to 76%."
"__label__Other Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved, the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented."
"__label__Other CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances, help consolidate sleep, as well as improve O2 saturations (i.e., to 96% and above, even during REM supine sleep) and overall sleep stage architecture."
"__label__Other Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep, activated during both ""light"" non-REM, as well as stage REM sleep (index = 8 per hour) with infrequent limb associated arousals (index = 1 per hour) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep (the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition)."
__label__Other Cardiac rates typically ranged between 72-87 beats per minute; average 80 beats per minute.
"__label__Other EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of ""diffuse"" spike-wave discharges were evident during light sleep, without associated clinical accompaniment."
"__label__Other Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre-CPAP conditions, but with prominent ""slow wave and REM rebounds"" subsequently noted with CPAP administration; i.e., accounting for more than 41% and more than 31% of the CPAP sleep times, respectively."

__label__Other 			Reason for visit:
__label__Other    Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.
__label__Other Interval History:
__label__Other    Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.
"__label__Other His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic."
__label__Other Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.
"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital."
"__label__Other Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up."
"__label__Other He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell."
"__label__Other The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there."
"__label__Other The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all."
"__label__Other Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards."
"__label__Other The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely."
"__label__Other His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens."
__label__Other It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.
"__label__Other At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease."
__label__Other Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.
"__label__Other The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature."
"__label__Other Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability."
__label__Other Past medical history:
"__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct    Diabetes, onset in 2135."
"__label__Other Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's."
__label__Other The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.
"__label__Other MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged."
__label__Other Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.
"__label__Other Neuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI."
__label__Other Cervical spondylosis.

__label__Other It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.
__label__Other He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.
__label__Other He has nocturia.
__label__Other He wears dentures.
__label__Other No significant weight loss or anorexia.
__label__Other No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.
__label__Other He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.
"__label__Other Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail."
__label__Other Physical examination:
__label__Other -Pulse:   68 and regular.
__label__Other Afebrile
"__label__Other -BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself."
__label__Other Equal bilaterally
"__label__Other -General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age."
"__label__Other Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance"
__label__Other -Skin:   Without rashes
"__label__Other -Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils"
"__label__Other -Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits."
__label__Other No JVD
__label__Other -Chest:   Clear
"__label__Other -Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs"
"__label__Other -Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender."
"__label__Other Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta."
__label__Other May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation
"__label__Other -Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides."
"__label__Other Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+."
__label__Other Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.
__label__Other Good capillary refill
"__label__Other -Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped."
"__label__Other His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution."
__label__Other He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.
"__label__Other Otherwise, no focal deficits"
__label__Other Procedures:
__label__Other Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.
"__label__Other 92 and 1.03, respectively."
__label__Other The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.
__label__Other I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.
__label__Other EKG:
__label__Other     demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.
"__label__Other There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay."
__label__Other Other Data:
__label__Other    DOB: 11/25/2083.
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
__label__Other    Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.
"__label__Other Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA."
"__label__Other Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example."
"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated."
"__label__Other His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease."
"__label__Other I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment."
__label__Other 1.
"__label__Other As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed."
"__label__Other Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease."
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.
__label__Other PLAN: 
__label__Other Formal exercise ABIs.
__label__Other Obtain angiographic studies from AC.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Followup visit in one month.

__label__Other Quick
__label__Other ATCH: 		655-75-45
__label__Other Dear Harry and Yair:
__label__Other My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.
"__label__Other As you know, she is just 52 years of age."
"__label__medication.sulfonylureas..before_dct Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year."
__label__Other She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.
__label__Other She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.
__label__Other She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.
__label__Other On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.
"__label__Other This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side."
__label__Other In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.
__label__Other There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.
__label__Other She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.
"__label__Other By last spring, i.e."
__label__Other a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.
__label__Other She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.
__label__Other Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.
__label__Other Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.
__label__Other Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (???
__label__Other length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.
__label__Other Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.
__label__Other She has sought an opinion here in this regard.
__label__Other She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.
__label__Other On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.
__label__Other Pulse was 70 and regular.
__label__Other Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.
"__label__Other She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse."
__label__Other There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.
__label__Other She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.
__label__Other This is of course a very unhappy situation.
__label__Other Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.
__label__Other However I am not absolutely ruling this out.
__label__Other I would suggest the following.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix."
__label__Other Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.
__label__Other She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.
__label__Other If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.
__label__Other I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.
__label__Other My thanks once again.
__label__Other With every best wish.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

"__label__Other Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted"
__label__Other since her fall on Monday.
__label__Other Did not have an x-ray of the area.
__label__Other Says it is very painful
__label__Other to sit.
__label__Other Roxicet was not helping.

__label__Other Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started
"__label__Other      only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with"
__label__Other      angioedema.
"__label__medication.diuretic..before_dct Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure"
__label__Other      is WNL.
__label__Other So will follow for now.
__label__Other (2)  Low back pain.
__label__Other Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which
__label__Other      treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut
__label__Other      pillow.
__label__Other Patient was given a prescription for the pillow.
__label__Other She was told to look
__label__Other      out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced
__label__Other      any perianal numbness or incontinence.
__label__Other Will notify patient by phone if x-ray
__label__Other      shows a fracture.
__label__Other (3)  Depression.

"__label__Other Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed."
"__label__Other However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66."
__label__Other 8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear.
"__label__Other U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin."
"__label__Other There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent."
__label__Other Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.
__label__Other Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days.

__label__Other I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.
__label__Other The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.
__label__Other In August he suffered a stroke.
__label__Other He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.
__label__Other He recalls no problem with his vision.
__label__Other He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.
__label__Other He does no know the extent of the evaluation.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.
__label__Other He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.
__label__Other His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.
__label__Other He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.
__label__Other He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.

__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct He has DM and HTN.
__label__smoker.never He is a nonsmoker.

__label__Other There is no history of alcohol abuse.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this."
__label__Other He has no known allergies.
__label__Other He is aware of no significant family history.
__label__Other He is married.
__label__Other He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.
__label__Other He came to america from Honduras in 2073.
__label__Other He worked nights in construction until his stroke.
"__label__Other Pulse 66, regular."
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct BP 186/110.
__label__Other There are no cranial bruits.
__label__Other The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.
__label__Other The lungs are clear.
__label__Other The heart is regular with no murmur.
__label__Other The abdomen is benign.
__label__Other The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.
"__label__Other He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well."
__label__Other His fluency in his native language is probably normal.
__label__Other Cranial nerves are intact.
"__label__Other There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5."
__label__Other (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)

__label__Other I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.
__label__Other He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.
__label__Other He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.
__label__Other I asked him to return here in a month to review this.

__label__Other right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.
__label__Other IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
__label__Other acute stroke or hemorrhage.
"__label__Other On the CT, there was a question of a"
__label__Other left MI cutoff.
__label__Other CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
__label__Other stenosis with minimal distal interflow.
__label__Other MRI of the brain showed
"__label__Other a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of"
__label__Other the caudate basal ganglia.
__label__Other She has had mild to moderate chronic
__label__Other small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.
__label__Other Echo showed a normal
"__label__Other EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
"__label__Other vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation"
__label__Other with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
__label__Other infarct.
"__label__Other On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both"
__label__Other comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.
__label__Other It
__label__Other is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
__label__Other stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
"__label__Other during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from"
__label__Other anti-coagulation therapy.
__label__Other I have asked her to get a follow up
__label__Other PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
__label__Other any contraindications to anti-coagulation.
__label__Other If there are no such
"__label__Other contraindications, she should restart on warfarin."
"__label__Other In addition,"
__label__Other her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d.
__label__Other and to maintain a
__label__Other blood pressure diary.
__label__Other RECOMMENDATIONS:
__label__Other 1.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
__label__Other t.i.d.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Continue risk factor modification with the management of
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing."
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
__label__Other stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
__label__Other per the PCP.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
__label__Other training and language rehab.
__label__Other 6.
__label__Other Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
__label__Other problems.
__label__Other More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
__label__Other and counseling.

__label__Other The patient was seen clinic
__label__Other and was thought to be depressed.
__label__Other The patient has a known history
__label__Other of a facial droop.
__label__Other The patient was incontinent of urine today.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs reveal the
"__label__Other following:  Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per"
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct minute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144/110, and"
__label__Other oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.
__label__Other The patient's oxygen
__label__Other saturation was interpreted as borderline low.
__label__Other General:  No acute
"__label__Other distress, multiple family members at bedside."
__label__Other HEENT:  The
"__label__Other patient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp"
__label__Other hematomas.
"__label__Other Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light."
"__label__Other Mucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no"
__label__Other drooling.

__label__Other INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 76-year-old female
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and"
__label__Other status and urinary incontinence.
__label__Other Differential diagnosis at this
__label__Other time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.
__label__Other patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and
__label__Other as per review of prior notes.
__label__Other Repeat stroke is certainly on the
"__label__Other differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a"
__label__Other metabolic or infectious etiology.
__label__Other The patient will need to have
"__label__Other a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley"
"__label__Other catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT"
__label__Other scan.
__label__Other EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency
"__label__Other Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed."
__label__Other The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid
__label__Other ventricular response.
__label__Other The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate
"__label__Other of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid"
"__label__Other ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the"
__label__Other lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.
__label__Other No definite
__label__Other ST segment abnormalities were noted.
__label__Other The patient then had a
"__label__Other portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable"
__label__Other chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or
__label__Other findings.
__label__Other The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and
__label__Other the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some
__label__Other right-sided edema.
__label__Other The patient will have this followed up with
__label__Other an MRI of the brain.
__label__Other The patient's laboratory studies were
__label__Other notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.
__label__Other The patient's
__label__Other lactic acid was 1.7.
__label__Other The patient's white blood cell count was
__label__Other not elevated.
__label__Other The patient was not anemic.
__label__Other urinalysis was consistent with infection.
__label__Other The patient's first
__label__Other set of cardiac markers were negative.
__label__Other The patient's coagulation
__label__Other studies were normal.
__label__Other The patient was treated with ceftriaxone
__label__Other for her urinary tract infection.
__label__Other The patient could possibly have
__label__Other urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.
__label__Other Urine sepsis is my
__label__Other leading diagnosis at this time.
__label__Other The patient's right-sided edema
"__label__Other is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient"
__label__Other will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.
__label__Other The patient
__label__Other will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.
__label__Other will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.
__label__Other The patient's blood
"__label__Other pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient"
__label__Other needs an intensive care unit bed.
__label__Other In terms the patient's atrial
"__label__Other fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was"
__label__Other given metoprolol IV.
__label__Other The patient was not given any oral
__label__Other medications secondary to her possible stroke.
__label__Other The patient was
__label__Other given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her
__label__Other elevated potassium at 5.2.
__label__Other PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Urosepsis.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Hyponatremia.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Hyperkalemia.
__label__Other DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a
__label__Other monitor bed.
"__label__Other CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded."

__label__Other ID Fellow: Amanda Qualls
__label__Other ID Attending: Craig Faulkner
__label__Other Referring Physician: Dr. Kevin Katz
__label__Other Date of Consult: 10/26/2092
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Reason for Consult: DM, chronic R and L. foot ulcerations; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, pain"
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct HPI: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM."
"__label__Other She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals."
"__label__Other She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics."
"__label__Other She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa."
"__label__Other In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting."
"__label__Other In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA."
"__label__Other She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening)."
"__label__Other She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge."
"__label__Other Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting."
"__label__Other In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely."
"__label__Other During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations."
"__label__Other She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically."
"__label__Other These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92."
"__label__Other She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds."
"__label__Other On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively."
"__label__Other She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft."
"__label__Other She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously."
__label__Other Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past.
"__label__Other Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot."
"__label__Other She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement."
"__label__Other She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias."
__label__Other She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.

__label__Other Date of Visit:  01/20/2120
__label__Other Bryan returns for followup of cerebrovascular disease.
__label__Other A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119.
__label__Other A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA.
__label__Other He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke.
__label__Other He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December.
__label__Other In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo.
__label__Other His wife called 911.
__label__Other He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed.
__label__Other He felt better.
"__label__Other He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly."
__label__Other An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia.
__label__Other Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.
__label__Other He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.
__label__Other He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet.
__label__Other He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy.
__label__Other He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication.
__label__Other There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms.
"__label__Other Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.
__label__Other Lying down he was hypertensive.
__label__Other He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119.
"__label__medication.fibrate..during_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine."

__label__Other The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength.
"__label__Other His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady."
__label__Other DTRs 1+ throughout.
__label__Other DATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable.
__label__Other CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described.
__label__Other CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA.
__label__Other Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA.
__label__Other There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect.
__label__Other There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.
__label__Other Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.
__label__Other Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged.
"__label__Other A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study."

__label__Other He has been doing well considering.
__label__Other The cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.
__label__Other It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology.
__label__Other He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement.

"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness."
__label__Other The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.
"__label__Other In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out."
"__label__Other The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation."
"__label__Other There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.
"__label__Other Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis."
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.
__label__smoker.unknown SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg."
__label__Other Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.
__label__Other The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
"__label__Other Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4."
__label__Other There is no murmur.
__label__Other The abdomen is soft and nontender.
__label__Other The liver is not palpably enlarged.
__label__Other The extremities are warm without edema.
__label__Other Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.
__label__Other There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
__label__Other There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.
__label__Other Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.
__label__Other Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block."
__label__Other Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.
__label__Other We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.
"__label__Other There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary."
__label__Other Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.
"__label__Other Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy."
__label__Other Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

__label__Other Micro Data: 
__label__Other None recently
"__label__Other Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)"
__label__Other Imaging:
__label__Other Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.
__label__Other The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear.
__label__Other The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease.
__label__Other There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.
"__label__Other AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly."
"__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall."
"__label__Other With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course."
"__label__Other Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis."
"__label__Other The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes."
__label__Other He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).
"__label__Other Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection."
"__label__Other However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder."
"__label__Other As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics."
"__label__Other The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative."
"__label__Other However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected."
__label__Other This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.
"__label__Other Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis)."
__label__Other Recommendations:
"__label__Other -hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data"
__label__Other -Aspirate shoulder.
"__label__Other Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures"
__label__Other -if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement
"__label__Other -would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection"
"__label__Other -likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement"
"__label__Other -check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo"
__label__Other Thank you for this interesting consultation.
__label__Other We will continue to follow with you.

__label__Other The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are

__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
"__label__Other history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131"
"__label__Other with good results who, last year before she left the"
"__label__Other country, had a subnormal TSH."
__label__Other She does not have obvious
__label__Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
__label__Other repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes continues to be a problem.
__label__Other Glycemic control
__label__Other continues to be difficult to achieve.
"__label__Other Today, I have"
__label__medication.metformin..after_dct reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o.
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other The son is going
__label__Other to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
__label__Other is not taking this medicine at this point.
__label__Other The other
__label__Other medications were continued.
__label__Other It is indeed possible that she
__label__medication.insulin..before_dct will need insulin in the near future.
__label__Other I plan close followup
__label__Other and will see her again in six weeks' time.
__label__Other If she is
"__label__Other hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in"
__label__Other achieving glycemic control.
__label__Other Against this is the high
__label__Other cholesterol.
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct She used to be on Lipitor, which was"
__label__Other discontinued during her trip to Ghana.
__label__Other I have
__label__medication.statin..before_dct reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o.
__label__Other I have also
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o.
__label__Other to protect
__label__Other her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

__label__Other 						RE:  Tyler Pearson
__label__Other 					                    WMC#727-19-02
__label__Other Dear Doctor Trejo:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Tyler Pearson, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today."
__label__Other As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.
__label__Other He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.
"__label__Other He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax."
__label__Other A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.
"__label__Other Assessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status."
__label__Other It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.
__label__Other I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.
__label__Other Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.
"__label__Other If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly."
"__label__Other Sincerely,"
"__label__Other 						Steven E. Land, M.D."
