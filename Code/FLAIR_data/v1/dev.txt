__label__Other NEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE 
__label__Other PATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes
__label__Other MRN: 78361343
__label__Other DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04
__label__Other Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness
__label__Other HPI:   
"__label__Other 69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion."
"__label__Other Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note)."
__label__Other Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.
"__label__Other She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months."
__label__Other Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly.
__label__Other An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
__label__Other There was no abnormal enhancement.
__label__Other This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
__label__Other EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
"__label__Other She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20)."
__label__Other CSF HSV PCR was negative.
__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.
"__label__Other An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC."
__label__Other CSF ACE was normal.
__label__Other Cultures were negative.
__label__Other CSF VDRL was negative.
__label__Other She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily.
"__label__Other In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab."
__label__Other This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin.
__label__Other Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.
"__label__Other Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance."
"__label__Other Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls."
"__label__Other Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down."
"__label__Other Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused."
"__label__Other She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom."
__label__Other It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days.
__label__Other Patient reports intermittent headaches.
"__label__Other On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities."
__label__Other ROS: 
__label__Other Reliability of ROS is questionable.
"__label__Other Neurologic: Except as above, there have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, speaking, language, swallowing, or gait."
"__label__Other General: negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and change in bowel or bladder habits."

__label__Other There is bilateral exophthalmus.
__label__Other CXR: today
__label__Other Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia.
__label__Other Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.
__label__Other EKG: sinus tachy.
__label__Other no ST changes or Q waves.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
"__label__Other 69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion."
__label__Other Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.
__label__Other Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities.
__label__Other Head CT unremarkable.
"__label__Other Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid."
"__label__Other She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP."
__label__Other She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.
"__label__Other This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion."
"__label__Other CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically."
__label__Other -check her gait
__label__Other -check ESR
__label__Other -LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
__label__Other -MRI of the brain
__label__Other -EEG
__label__Other -further lab w/u pending LP results
__label__Other -remove foley catheter
__label__Other -PT consult

__label__Other Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.
__label__Other Her nares are without discharge.
__label__Other Oropharynx with dentures.
__label__Other She has no erythema or exudate.
"__label__Other Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits."

"__label__Other This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible."
"__label__Other At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan."
__label__Other Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
__label__Other She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
__label__Other I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
__label__Other She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
__label__Other She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
"__label__Other Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology."
"__label__Other If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate."

__label__Other History of The Present Illness:  
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct 	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath."
"__label__Other He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis."
__label__Other He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication.
"__label__Other His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper."
"__label__Other He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea."
"__label__Other On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness."
"__label__Other He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder."
__label__Other This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted.
"__label__Other The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths."
__label__Other He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day.
__label__Other This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath.
"__label__Other He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts."

"__label__Other The proximal, mid- and distal graft is"
__label__Other   widely patent.
__label__Other The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 
__label__Other (below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 
"__label__Other velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis."
__label__Other The distal native ( posterior 
__label__Other tibial artery)  is patent.
__label__Other IMPRESSION
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 
__label__Other knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a

__label__Other The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up.
__label__Other She has been having

"__label__Other There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other"
__label__Other symptoms.
__label__Other She has not actually had syncope.
__label__Other There is no positional component to her
__label__Other I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms.
__label__Other The
"__label__Other MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum"

__label__Other Dear Dr.  Osuna:
__label__Other   I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina."
"__label__medication.arb..during_dct His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure."
__label__Other He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.
__label__Other Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.
"__label__Other He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort."
"__label__Other He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami."
__label__Other He is no longer using a CPAP.
__label__Other Current Medications:

__label__Other -BP: 135/90  
__label__Other -resp.
__label__Other rate:   12 and unlabored
__label__Other -General:   He is a mildly overweight white male in no acute distress.
__label__Other Alert and cooperative.

"__label__Other -Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag."
__label__Other Mucous membranes are moist.
__label__Other Trachea is midline
__label__Other -Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.
"__label__Other Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke."
__label__Other JVP is less than 7 cm of water
"__label__Other -Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes"
"__label__Other -Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border"
__label__Other -Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.
__label__Other No organomegaly.
__label__Other No pulsatile masses
__label__Other -Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.
__label__Other He has trace pedal edema bilaterally
__label__Other Procedures:
__label__Other Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.
"__label__Other concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation."
__label__Other Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.
__label__Other Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.
__label__cad.test.before_dct Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.
__label__Other The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.
__label__Other EKG:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct     shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI."
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct    In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution."
__label__Other There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique.
__label__Other I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease.
"__label__Other Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm."
__label__Other We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

"__label__Other In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol."
__label__Other Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.
__label__Other Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.
__label__Other Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.
"__label__Other In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071."
"__label__Other Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.statin..after_dct daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o."

"__label__Other Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago."
__label__Other The neck is supple.
__label__Other JVP is flat.
__label__Other Carotids are without significant bruits.
__label__Other Chest remains clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base."
__label__Other No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
"__label__Other The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit."
__label__Other Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.
"__label__Other Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished."
__label__Other Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.
__label__cad.event.before_dct There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.
"__label__Other Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower."
"__label__Other Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o.
__label__Other daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.
__label__Other I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.
__label__Other She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.
"__label__Other Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61."
"__label__Other She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy."
__label__Other She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.
"__label__Other In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor."
"__label__Other At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing."
"__label__Other Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program."
__label__Other I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

"__label__Other Post, IN 86454"
"__label__Other Dear Dr. Null, "
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.
"__label__Other While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer."
__label__cad.event.before_dct MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in."
"__label__Other Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted."
"__label__Other His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident."
"__label__Other He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up."
"__label__Other Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed."
"__label__Other Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months."
"__label__Other He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes."
"__label__Other He feels well, and has had no problems."
"__label__Other He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea."
"__label__Other He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication."
"__label__Other He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's."
__label__Other His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.
__label__Other His past medical history includes:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA"
__label__cad.event.before_dct  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
"__label__Other  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT"
__label__Other  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
__label__Other  hypothyroid
__label__Other  basal cell skin CA
__label__Other  nephrolithiasis
__label__Other His medications include:
__label__medication.statin..before_dct  Lipitor 80 mg
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct  Plavix 75 mg
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct  ASA 325 mg po QD
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct  Lopressor 200 mg po BID
__label__Other  Prilosec 20 mg
__label__Other He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD."
"__label__Other He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job."
__label__Other He is now back at work.
"__label__Other He is married, and lives in Lincoln City."
"__label__Other He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets."
__label__smoker.never He has never smoked cigarettes.
"__label__Other He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam."
"__label__Other On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75."
__label__Other He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
"__label__Other His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits."
__label__Other His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
"__label__Other He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups."
__label__Other His abdomen is benign.
"__label__Other He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI."
__label__Other He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.
__label__Other His recent cardiac tests include: 
"__label__Other  - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease"
"__label__cad.event.before_dct  - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result "
"__label__cad.event.before_dct In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA."
"__label__Other He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event."
__label__Other Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin."
"__label__Other Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix."
"__label__Other His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time."
"__label__Other We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time."
"__label__Other Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia."
"__label__Other Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course."
"__label__Other At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing."
__label__Other It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
"__label__Other I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns."
"__label__Other Regards,"

__label__Other Patient Name: Yasseen Jacks
__label__Other MRN#: 8841350
__label__Other Attending: Uriel Mays MD
__label__Other Code status: DNR/DNI per discussion with son
"__label__Other Historian: medical record, patient's son Ursula Jacks"
__label__Other Chief Complaint: agitation
__label__Other HPI: 
"__label__Other Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home."
__label__Other As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.
__label__Other The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.
"__label__Other Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions."
"__label__Other They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife."
__label__Other He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.
__label__Other His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.
__label__Other His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.
__label__Other They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady.
"__label__Other About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out."
__label__Other Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.
__label__Other They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.
__label__Other Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.
"__label__Other They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes."
__label__Other They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.

__label__Other     MR#65772757
"__label__Other Dear Xzavior, "
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow
__label__Other up of his emphysema.
__label__Other The patient reports that he continues to lead a very
__label__Other active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours
"__label__Other a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes."
__label__Other When he
__label__Other returns home from work he cooks dinner and this
__label__Other combined with his work schedule and picking up his
__label__Other daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited
__label__Other him from a regular exercise program.
"__label__Other Needless to say,"
__label__Other he has remained active.
__label__Other He is not limited in these
__label__Other activities by his respiratory function with the
__label__Other exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with
__label__Other heavy lifting.
__label__Other He uses albuterol during these
__label__Other instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day.
__label__Other His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350
__label__Other liters per minute.
__label__Other He knows that when his PEFR falls
__label__Other to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for
__label__Other advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1
__label__Other burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.
__label__Other His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220
"__label__Other micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI"
"__label__Other 2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec"
__label__Other and the albuterol as mentioned above.
"__label__Other RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 "
__label__Other The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of
"__label__Other fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,"
__label__Other change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.
__label__Other He does
__label__Other continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to
__label__Other frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.
__label__Other There is
__label__Other no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.
"__label__Other On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress."
"__label__Other NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva."
__label__Other TM's are clear with
__label__Other normal light reflexes bilaterally.
__label__Other His nasal mucosa is notable
__label__Other for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.
__label__Other No
__label__Other significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary
__label__Other chains.
__label__Other Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and
__label__Other prolongation of his expiratory phase.
__label__Other He has an occasional
__label__Other expiratory wheeze.
__label__Other There are no focal findings of consolidation
__label__Other and air movement is moderate.
__label__Other No significant JVD and he has a
"__label__Other regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and"
"__label__Other there are no murmurs, rubs or S3."
"__label__Other Abdomen is benign without HSM,"
__label__Other focal tenderness or masses.
__label__Other His extremities are without
"__label__Other clubbing, cyanosis or edema."
__label__Other His weight is 223 pounds.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his"
__label__Other respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation
__label__Other of 97 percent.
__label__Other My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction
__label__Other secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.
__label__Other I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active
__label__Other life.
__label__Other We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of
__label__Other prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact
__label__Other information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of
__label__Other a flare.
__label__Other I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.
__label__Other To
__label__Other try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of
"__label__Other prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun"
__label__Other Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to
__label__Other be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.
__label__Other We talked about
__label__Other vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the
__label__Other influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia
__label__Other vaccine.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care.
__label__Other He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time
__label__Other but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a
__label__Other flare of his COPD.

__label__Other taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.
__label__Other The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.
__label__Other Her blood 
__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
__label__Other been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from

__label__Other We have made some adjustments recently in

"__label__Other Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has "

__label__Other She does note that she is having some pain

__label__Other The

__label__Other monitoring.
__label__Other My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
__label__Other I will 
__label__Other not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
__label__Other I 
"__label__Other suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I "
"__label__Other would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it "

"__label__Other Youssef Nall, M.D."
__label__Other Ludlow Medical Center
__label__Other 45 Wilder St
"__label__Other Post, IN  86454"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Nall:
__label__cad.event.before_dct It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.
"__label__Other As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors."
"__label__Other He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.before_dct He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight."
"__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results."
__label__Other He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o."
__label__Other daily lifelong.
"__label__Other We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity."
"__label__Other Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times."
__label__Other He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.
"__label__Other He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion."
__label__Other He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85."
__label__Other His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
__label__Other He has had no side effects to his medications.
__label__smoker.never He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
"__label__Other He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o."
"__label__Other daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o."
__label__Other b.i.d.
__label__Other Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular."
__label__Other His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
__label__Other There are no bruits.
__label__Other His chest is clear to auscultation.
__label__Other He was not clubbed.
"__label__Other His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs."
__label__Other He had no peripheral edema.
__label__Other His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
__label__Other His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
"__label__Other EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement."
__label__Other Prior inferior Q-wave MI.
"__label__Other Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level."
__label__Other TSH was also normal.
__label__diabetes.a1c.during_dct Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.during_dct Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102."
__label__Other Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.
"__label__Other Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.
__label__Other He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.
__label__medication.niacin..after_dct We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin."
"__label__Other The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening."
"__label__Other To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition."
"__label__Other We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today."
"__label__Other Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well."
__label__Other We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.
"__label__Other If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital."
__label__Other He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.
__label__Other This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.
"__label__Other Yours sincerely,"

"__label__Other Dear Dr. Xanthos,"
"__label__Other We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in"
"__label__Other the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093."
__label__Other We will
__label__Other not repeat her history as you know it well.
__label__Other Over the past three
"__label__Other months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,"
"__label__Other occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness"
__label__Other and tingling of the fingers and toes.
__label__Other She has maintained a
"__label__Other relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness"
__label__Other of breath.
"__label__Other An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092"
__label__Other revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
"__label__Other minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function."
__label__Other On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
__label__Other pounds.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular."
__label__Other The
__label__Other lungs are clear.
__label__Other There is no peripheral edema.
"__label__Other Again, there marked"
__label__Other cushingoid features.
"__label__Other Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent"
__label__Other comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
__label__Other facial hair over the past several months.
"__label__Other In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of"
__label__Other uremia.
__label__Other Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
__label__Other undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
__label__Other dialysis within the next several months.
__label__Other We have arranged to
__label__Other recheck her chemistries today.
__label__Other We would also recommend that she
__label__Other undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.
__label__Other Although renal
__label__Other failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
"__label__Other androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary."
__label__Other Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

__label__Other Assessment and Plan:
__label__Other 1.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Diabetes.
"__label__Other She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, "
"__label__Other      has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been "
"__label__Other      ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below."
__label__Other This is 
__label__Other      borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.
__label__Other She 
"__label__Other      definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight "
__label__Other      is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.
__label__Other She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
__label__Other      and urine dip.
"__label__Other She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one "
"__label__Other      for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her."
__label__Other She also needs 
__label__Other      to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Health maintenance.
__label__Other Patient does not want a flu shot.
"__label__Other Otherwise, "
"__label__Other      she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter "
__label__Other      with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.
__label__Other We will do so.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Migraine headaches.
__label__Other She said she has had one every day recently.
__label__Other This is worse than her usual.
__label__Other The Motrin was not helping.
__label__Other I 
__label__Other      therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
__label__Other      use.
"__label__Other Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do."
__label__Other I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Ankle pain.
__label__Other Patient has chronic ankle pain.
__label__Other She went to an 
__label__Other      Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
__label__Other      got better.
__label__Other She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
__label__Other      and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.
__label__Other I therefore referred 
__label__Other      her at her request.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Feldman:
__label__Other We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
__label__Other today in the Cardiology clinic.
"__label__Other As you know, she is a"
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,"
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary"
"__label__Other disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on"
"__label__Other echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia."
__label__Other She
"__label__Other last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup"
__label__Other appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
__label__Other Oregon.
"__label__Other Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has"
__label__Other been doing quite well.
__label__Other She states that she has episodes of
"__label__Other palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5"
__label__Other minutes.
"__label__Other She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with"
"__label__Other no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope."
"__label__Other She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley"
"__label__Other continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting."
__label__Other states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
__label__Other Cessation Program.
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg"
"__label__medication.metformin..after_dct q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,"
"__label__Other Protonix, and Allegra."
"__label__Other On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress."
"__label__Other Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65"
__label__Other beats per minute.
"__label__Other Extremities are warm, with no peripheral"
__label__Other edema.
__label__Other Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
__label__Other JVP is 8 cm of water.
__label__Other Chest is clear to auscultation and
__label__Other percussion bilaterally.
"__label__Other PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,"
"__label__Other physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs."
__label__Other Abdomen
__label__Other is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
__label__Other Pulse examination is
__label__Other normal.
__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
__label__Other ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
"__label__Other minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC"
"__label__Other 467, and QRS axis 33 degrees."
__label__Other There is a nonspecific Q-wave
"__label__Other abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change"
__label__Other compared to prior.
"__label__Other In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well."
__label__Other Her palpitations and
__label__Other likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
__label__Other quite acceptable for her.
"__label__Other Therefore, she wishes no consideration"
__label__Other of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
__label__Other has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
__label__Other Regarding
"__label__Other her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably"
"__label__Other well controlled today, and you are actively managing her"
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct diabetes.
"__label__Other However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated"
__label__Other LDL.
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor"
__label__Other to 40 mg q.h.s.
__label__Other I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
__label__Other Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
__label__Other cardiovascular issues.
__label__Other Thank you very much for referring this
__label__Other very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
