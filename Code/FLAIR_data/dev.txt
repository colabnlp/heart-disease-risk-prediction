__label__Other MAJOR DIAGNOSIS:  Lung mass.
__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Lauren is a 75-year-old woman.
__label__smoker.past She has only a very remote history of smoking, smoking not at all after the age of 30.
__label__Other In early March, she was undergoing a routine physical.
__label__Other At that time, she reported she had some mild weight loss.
__label__Other However, she had been trying to lose weight.
__label__Other She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough.
__label__Other A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass.
__label__Other The patient subsequently had a CT scan.
__label__Other The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe.
__label__Other There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm.
__label__Other She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs.
__label__Other The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation.
__label__Other The patient has no history of lung .
__label__Other She has no history of asthma or allergies.
__label__Other She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD.
__label__Other She has no history of malignancy.
__label__Other She has no avocational exposures to dust or danders.
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Mild vascular dementia.

__label__Other 8.
__label__Other Renal artery stenosis with mild renal failure.
__label__Other 9.
__label__Other Carotid artery stenosis.
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.
__label__Other She does not drink.
__label__smoker.past She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.
__label__Other FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.
__label__Other Her O2 saturation is 95%.
__label__Other Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.
__label__Other Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.
__label__Other Her nares are without discharge.
__label__Other Oropharynx with dentures.
__label__Other She has no erythema or exudate.
__label__Other Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.
__label__Other Her thorax is kyphotic.
__label__Other She has normal fremitus and percussion.
__label__Other Her lungs are clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.
__label__Other Abdomen is soft.
__label__Other Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
__label__Other She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.
__label__Other She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.
__label__Other LABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.
__label__Other IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.
__label__Other This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.
__label__Other At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.
__label__Other Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.
__label__Other She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.
__label__Other I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.
__label__Other She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.
__label__Other She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.
__label__Other Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.

__label__Other RE:  Peggy Tinsley
__label__Other      MR #236-67-03-3
__label__Other Dear Dr. Ventura:
__label__Other Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.
__label__Other This patient
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
__label__Other on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.
__label__Other She has been doing well
__label__Other except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
__label__Other the past week.
__label__Other There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
__label__Other pain.
__label__Other She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.
__label__Other Her blood
__label__Other sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.
__label__Other Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
__label__Other NPH 10 units qam.
__label__Other On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
__label__Other dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.
__label__Other CBC at the time
__label__Other revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.
__label__Other Blood
__label__Other cultures were sent.
__label__Other On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
__label__Other and a pulse of 88.
__label__Other She was afebrile.
__label__Other Head and neck examination
__label__Other was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.
__label__Other On cardiovascular
__label__Other examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
__label__Other peripheral edema.
__label__Other Heart sounds were normal.
__label__Other Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
__label__Other protein and 2+ glucose.
__label__Other Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center.
__label__Other There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection.
__label__Other She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
__label__Other tract infection.
__label__Other Because of her early satiety she has been
__label__Other eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
__label__Other gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

__label__Other SYMPTOMS
__label__Other FINDINGS
__label__Other The inflow (the left  mid superficial femoral artery)  is patent.
__label__Other The 
__label__Other proximal anastomosis is widely patent.
__label__Other The proximal, mid- and distal graft is
__label__Other   widely patent.
__label__Other The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 
__label__Other (below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 
__label__Other velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis.
__label__Other The distal native ( posterior 
__label__Other tibial artery)  is patent.
__label__Other IMPRESSION
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 
__label__Other knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a 
__label__Other compromised graft.

__label__Other After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then 
__label__Other returned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of 
__label__Other right lower quadrant pain.
__label__Other CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal 
__label__Other thickening with fat stranding locally.
__label__Other She subsequently was taken to 
__label__Other the operating room.
__label__Other Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she 
__label__Other was discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.
__label__Other Her complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating 
__label__Other to iron intake.
__label__Other She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk 
__label__Other of magnesia for this.
__label__Other She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, 
__label__Other which she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest 
__label__Other pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
__label__Other or calf pain.

__label__Other The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up.
__label__Other She has been having
__label__Other symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
__label__Other clear history of her symptoms.
__label__Other At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
__label__Other fall over to her right side.
__label__Other There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
__label__Other symptoms.
__label__Other She has not actually had syncope.
__label__Other There is no positional component to her
__label__Other I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms.
__label__Other The
__label__Other MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
__label__Other ovale and bilateral pontine region.
__label__Other She had small chronic lacunar infarcts.
__label__Other She reports
__label__Other that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
__label__Other would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms.
__label__Other She had some left internal carotid
__label__Other mild 30% proximal stenosis.
__label__Other Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Most likely related to hypertension rather
__label__Other than embolic disease.
__label__Other Her blood pressure has been very well controlled.
__label__Other In fact, today
__label__Other on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60.
__label__Other She brought her medications with her and

__label__Other Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.
__label__Other Her lungs are clear without
__label__Other wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
__label__Other Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
__label__Other S1, S2.

__label__Other Now with lower blood
__label__Other pressure and some lightheadedness.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct We will d/c her atenolol.
__label__Other I would like her to get a
__label__Other repeat blood pressure in one week.
__label__Other I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
__label__Other Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her

__label__Other RE:  Otis Narvaez
__label__Other      MR #045-61-32-6
__label__Other Dear Uddin:
__label__Other Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
__label__Other undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.
__label__Other His previous visit with me occurred on
__label__Other February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.
__label__Other He
__label__Other denied chest pain, but did admit to a tight feeling down his left arm on occasion.
__label__Other This was not
__label__Other associated with activity.
__label__Other He admits to being a very sedentary person.
__label__Other The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
__label__Other LV function, and CT coronary angiography.
__label__Other There were no significant findings on the clinical
__label__Other evaluation.
__label__Other The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion.
__label__Other The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
__label__Other limiting stenosis.
__label__Other There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
__label__Other was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging.
__label__Other There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.
__label__Other The
__label__cad.test.before_dct narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.
__label__Other A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
__label__Other cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
__label__Other 342 mg/dl.
__label__Other He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.
__label__Other He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
__label__Other insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.
__label__Other Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.
__label__Other denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.
__label__Other His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
__label__Other Otis Narvaez
__label__Other MR #045-61-32-6
__label__Other Page 2
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.
__label__Other He usually takes these once every other day.
__label__Other He is
__label__medication.insulin..before_dct now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.
__label__Other He takes this at bedtime.
__label__Other Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.
__label__Other This causes him
__label__Other to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.
__label__Other He also has chronic low
__label__Other back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.
__label__Other He also has
__label__Other degenerative joint disease in his knees.
__label__Other He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
__label__Other depression.
__label__Other He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.
__label__Other On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
__label__Other cell carcinoma.
__label__Other On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.
__label__Other His
__label__Other weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.
__label__Other Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
__label__Other reveals upper dentures in place.
__label__Other There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear.
__label__Other There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.
__label__Other On cardiac examination, the heart
__label__Other sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
__label__Other rubs, or gallops.
__label__Other The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
__label__Other distal right calf.
__label__Other There is no edema noted.
__label__Other I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
__label__Other catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.
__label__Other He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
__label__Other Kraft will perform the procedure.
__label__Other His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
__label__Other catheterization.
__label__Other After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
__label__Other comprehensive metabolic profile performed.
__label__Other He will return to see me in the office again in one
__label__Other month.
__label__Other Best personal regards.
__label__Other Sincerely,

__label__Other RE: Lloyd Gregg 
__label__Other     MR#65772757
__label__Other Dear Xzavior, 
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow
__label__Other up of his emphysema.
__label__Other The patient reports that he continues to lead a very
__label__Other active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours
__label__Other a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.
__label__Other When he
__label__Other returns home from work he cooks dinner and this
__label__Other combined with his work schedule and picking up his
__label__Other daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited
__label__Other him from a regular exercise program.
__label__Other Needless to say,
__label__Other he has remained active.
__label__Other He is not limited in these
__label__Other activities by his respiratory function with the
__label__Other exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with
__label__Other heavy lifting.
__label__Other He uses albuterol during these
__label__Other instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day.
__label__Other His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350
__label__Other liters per minute.
__label__Other He knows that when his PEFR falls
__label__Other to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for
__label__Other advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1
__label__Other burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.
__label__Other His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220
__label__Other micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI
__label__Other 2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec
__label__Other and the albuterol as mentioned above.
__label__Other RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 
__label__Other The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of
__label__Other fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,
__label__Other change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.
__label__Other He does
__label__Other continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to
__label__Other frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.
__label__Other There is
__label__Other no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.
__label__Other On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress.
__label__Other NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.
__label__Other TM's are clear with
__label__Other normal light reflexes bilaterally.
__label__Other His nasal mucosa is notable
__label__Other for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.
__label__Other No
__label__Other significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary
__label__Other chains.
__label__Other Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and
__label__Other prolongation of his expiratory phase.
__label__Other He has an occasional
__label__Other expiratory wheeze.
__label__Other There are no focal findings of consolidation
__label__Other and air movement is moderate.
__label__Other No significant JVD and he has a
__label__Other regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and
__label__Other there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.
__label__Other Abdomen is benign without HSM,
__label__Other focal tenderness or masses.
__label__Other His extremities are without
__label__Other clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
__label__Other His weight is 223 pounds.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his
__label__Other respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation
__label__Other of 97 percent.
__label__Other My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction
__label__Other secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen.
__label__Other I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active
__label__Other life.
__label__Other We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

__label__Other ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.
__label__Other She is a 
__label__Other 70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
__label__Other fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
__label__cad.event.before_dct Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
__label__Other history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
__label__Other diminution after the surgery.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
__label__Other 20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.
__label__Other She is also 
__label__Other taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.
__label__Other The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.
__label__Other Her blood 
__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
__label__Other been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
__label__Other 150 all the way up to 450.
__label__Other We have made some adjustments recently in 
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.
__label__Other Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
__label__Other been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
__label__Other medicines without problems.
__label__Other She does note that she is having some pain 
__label__Other down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.
__label__Other The 
__label__Other patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
__label__Other wanes over time.
__label__Other The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
__label__Other this.
__label__Other The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
__label__Other fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
__label__Other walks with a walker today.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure: 144/76.
__label__Other Pulse: 78 and 
__label__Other regular.
__label__Other Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.
__label__Other Her heart 
__label__Other is with sharp click during S1 and S2.
__label__Other She has got a regular rate and 
__label__Other rhythm today.
__label__Other Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.
__label__Other She has got a well-healed abdominal scar.
__label__Other She has got no lower extremity 
__label__Other edema.
__label__Other Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
__label__Other into the sciatic notch on the left side.
__label__Other She has got otherwise joints 
__label__Other that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth.
__label__Other There 
__label__Other is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.
__label__Other Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
__label__Other monitoring.
__label__Other My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.
__label__Other I will 
__label__Other not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.
__label__Other I 
__label__Other suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
__label__Other would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
__label__Other remits on it's own.

__label__Other PAGE 2
__label__Other Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
__label__Other last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
__label__Other She is 
__label__Other clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
__label__Other her being able to manage her own medications.
__label__Other I have discussed this 
__label__Other issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
__label__Other with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.
__label__Other I will talk 
__label__Other to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
__label__Other his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
__label__Other without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
__label__Other finally in a more regular situation.
__label__Other We will try this over time and see 
__label__Other how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
__label__Other letting her drive on her own.

__label__Other He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.
__label__Other He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.
__label__Other His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.
__label__Other He has had no side effects to his medications.
__label__smoker.never He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o.
__label__medication.thienopyridine..before_dct daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o.
__label__Other daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o.

__label__Other Physical Examination: Nick looked well.
__label__Other His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.
__label__Other There are no bruits.
__label__Other His chest is clear to auscultation.
__label__Other He was not clubbed.
__label__Other He had no peripheral edema.
__label__Other His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
__label__Other His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.
__label__Other EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.

__label__Other No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.
__label__Other However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion.
__label__Other No evidence for deep venous thrombosis.
__label__Other Small right pleural effusion.
__label__Other Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.
__label__Other EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.
__label__Other The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF.
__label__Other The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear.
__label__Other More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI.
__label__Other Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT.
__label__Other Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion.
__label__Other Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process?
__label__Other If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative.
__label__Other Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms.

__label__Other RE:  Roberta Vincent
__label__Other      MR #380-18-32-2
__label__Other Dear Dr. Xanthos,
__label__Other We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
__label__Other the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.
__label__Other We will
__label__Other not repeat her history as you know it well.
__label__Other Over the past three
__label__Other months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
__label__Other occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
__label__Other and tingling of the fingers and toes.
__label__Other She has maintained a
__label__Other relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
__label__Other of breath.
__label__Other An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
__label__Other revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
__label__Other minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
__label__Other On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
__label__Other pounds.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.
__label__Other The
__label__Other lungs are clear.
__label__Other There is no peripheral edema.
__label__Other Again, there marked
__label__Other cushingoid features.
__label__Other Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
__label__Other comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
__label__Other facial hair over the past several months.
__label__Other In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
__label__Other uremia.
__label__Other Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
__label__Other undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
__label__Other dialysis within the next several months.
__label__Other We have arranged to
__label__Other recheck her chemistries today.
__label__Other We would also recommend that she
__label__Other undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.
__label__Other Although renal
__label__Other failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
__label__Other androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
__label__Other Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.
__label__Other MR #380-18-32-2

__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of any further
__label__Other assistance.

__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
__label__Other regular follow-up.
__label__Other Assessment and Plan:
__label__Other 1.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes.
__label__Other She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
__label__Other      has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
__label__Other      ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.
__label__Other This is 
__label__Other      borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.
__label__Other She 
__label__Other      definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
__label__Other      is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.
__label__Other She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
__label__Other      and urine dip.
__label__Other She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
__label__Other      for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.
__label__Other She also needs 
__label__Other      to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Health maintenance.
__label__Other Patient does not want a flu shot.
__label__Other Otherwise, 
__label__Other      she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
__label__Other      with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.
__label__Other We will do so.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Migraine headaches.
__label__Other She said she has had one every day recently.
__label__Other This is worse than her usual.
__label__Other The Motrin was not helping.
__label__Other I 
__label__Other      therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
__label__Other      use.
__label__Other Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.
__label__Other I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Ankle pain.
__label__Other Patient has chronic ankle pain.
__label__Other She went to an 
__label__Other      Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
__label__Other      got better.
__label__Other She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
__label__Other      and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.
__label__Other I therefore referred 
__label__Other      her at her request.

__label__Other Phone:  851-9764-289.
__label__Other Dear Dr. Feldman:
__label__Other We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
__label__Other today in the Cardiology clinic.
__label__Other As you know, she is a
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
__label__smoker.current dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
__label__Other disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
__label__Other echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
__label__Other She
__label__Other last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
__label__Other appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
__label__Other Oregon.
__label__Other Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
__label__Other been doing quite well.
__label__Other She states that she has episodes of
__label__Other palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
__label__Other minutes.
__label__Other She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
__label__Other no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
__label__Other She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.
__label__Other Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
__label__Other continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.
__label__Other states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
__label__Other Cessation Program.
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
__label__medication.metformin..during_dct q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
__label__Other Protonix, and Allegra.
__label__Other On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress.
__label__Other Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
__label__Other beats per minute.
__label__Other Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
__label__Other edema.
__label__Other Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits.
__label__Other JVP is 8 cm of water.
__label__Other Chest is clear to auscultation and
__label__Other percussion bilaterally.
__label__Other PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
__label__Other physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.
__label__Other Abdomen
__label__Other is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.
__label__Other Pulse examination is
__label__Other normal.
__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.
__label__Other ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
__label__Other minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
__label__Other 467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.
__label__Other There is a nonspecific Q-wave
__label__Other abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
__label__Other compared to prior.
__label__Other In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.
__label__Other Her palpitations and
__label__Other likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
__label__Other quite acceptable for her.
__label__Other Therefore, she wishes no consideration
__label__Other of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.
__label__Other has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.
__label__Other Regarding
__label__Other her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
__label__Other well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct diabetes.
__label__Other However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
__label__Other LDL.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
__label__Other to 40 mg q.h.s.
__label__Other I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months.
__label__Other Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
__label__Other cardiovascular issues.
__label__Other Thank you very much for referring this
__label__Other very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.
__label__Other Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
__label__Other preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.
