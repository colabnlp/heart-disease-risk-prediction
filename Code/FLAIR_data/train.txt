"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers."
"__label__Other He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache."
"__label__Other As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded."
"__label__Other He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning."
"__label__Other He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms."
"__label__Other Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up."
"__label__Other Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting."
"__label__Other He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing."
"__label__Other That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors."
"__label__Other He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation."
__label__Other The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.
"__label__Other He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup."
__label__Other He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.
"__label__Other Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan."
"__label__Other He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting."
"__label__Other In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air."
"__label__Other He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus."
__label__Other CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.
__label__Other Oncology History (per attending notes)
__label__Other Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
"__label__Other On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time."
__label__Other The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
__label__Other Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
"__label__Other On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma."
__label__Other Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
"__label__Other Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease."
__label__Other On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
"__label__Other This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space."
__label__Other The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
__label__Other There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
__label__Other PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
__label__Other The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
__label__Other 3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).

__label__Other _____________________________________________________________________________________
__label__Other I/P: 
__label__Other 73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.
"__label__Other Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum."
"__label__Other Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left."
__label__Other The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.
"__label__Other The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes."
"__label__Other The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential."
__label__Other The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.
"__label__Other Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely."
"__label__Other In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes."
"__label__Other Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent."
__label__Other a.
__label__Other Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.
__label__Other b.	Sputum gram stain and culture
__label__Other c.	Blood cultures

"__label__Other g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea."
__label__Other h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake.
__label__Other Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g."
__label__Other hypoglycemia).
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult."
"__label__Other The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely."
__label__Other Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.
__label__Other The dizziness was positional in nature.
"__label__Other The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms."
"__label__Other In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone."
__label__Other a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour.
__label__Other b.
__label__Other Check orthostatics daily.
"__label__Other Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum."
__label__Other Has been on Taxotere for the last six months.
"__label__Other Patient does not know of new findings, to discuss with Dr. Otero in AM."
__label__Other Consider alternative therapies.
__label__Other Anemia: Patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV=73).
__label__Other Not known to be iron-deficient.
"__label__Other Iron studies (Iron, Ferritin, TIBC) to assess iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease."
__label__Other b.	Guaiac stool for evidence of occult blood.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct HTN:  
__label__Other Patient is stable on current regimen.
__label__Other No changes to medications.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct CAD/hypercholesterolemia:

__label__Other b.	Cardiac enzymes negative times one.
"__label__Other Per Oncology fellow, no need to cycle given stability of TW changes in EKG and lack of anginal symptoms"
__label__Other c.	Low fat diet
__label__Other 7.
__label__Other Renal vein thrombosis: 
__label__Other Stable on Coumadin.
__label__Other b.	Clarify goal INR level.
__label__Other Currently INR=3.4.
__label__Other Prophylaxis:
__label__Other a.	Nexium for GI prophylaxis
__label__Other b.	Colace/Mylanta for constipation.
"__label__Other c.	Low-fat, no added salt, no concentrated sugar diet."
__label__Other d.	Finger sticks after each meal.

__label__Other Agree with above excellent HCC3 note.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h/o esophageal CA (Stage 4B), DM, HTN, CAD s/p LAD stent, renal v. thrombosis on Coumadin."
"__label__Other He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of ""room spinning"" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea."
__label__Other His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea.
"__label__Other Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L.  He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic."
__label__Other Will treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP.
"__label__Other Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED)."
__label__Other Check orthostatics.
__label__Other IVF gentle hydration.
__label__Other Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.
__label__Other Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.
__label__Other EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.
__label__Other Will treat nausea symptomatically.
__label__Other Discussed with onc fellow (Dr. Kramer).

"__label__Other Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941"
"__label__Other Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D."
"__label__Other DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome."
"__label__Other HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain."
"__label__Other The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand."
__label__Other This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.
__label__Other Also bothers him during prolonged activity.
"__label__Other He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function."
__label__Other Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.
__label__Other He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.
"__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER."
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium."
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  None.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress."
__label__Other Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.
__label__Other There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
__label__Other very weak opponens.
"__label__Other He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist."
__label__Other His interossei and extensors are full.
__label__Other Sensation is intact throughout.
"__label__Other EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.
"__label__Other At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome."
"__label__Other Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as "
__label__Other possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.
__label__Other We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.
__label__Other We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.
"__label__Other We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office."

__label__Other CARDIOLOGY
__label__Other PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC
__label__Other Reason for visit:
__label__Other    Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.
__label__Other She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases
__label__Other Interval History:
__label__Other    Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.
__label__Other She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.
__label__Other She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.
__label__Other Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.
__label__Other She had global hypokinesis.
__label__Other She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.
"__label__Other She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion."
__label__Other Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.
__label__Other d dimer 400 rnage.
__label__Other BNP elevated at 500.
__label__Other VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.
__label__Other Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.
__label__Other Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.
__label__Other A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.
__label__Other Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.
__label__Other The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.
__label__Other Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:
__label__Other Lasix 20mg
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Toprol XL 50mg
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct ASA 325mg
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Zestril 20mg
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Lantus 10 units hs
__label__medication.sulfonylureas.metformin.during_dct Glucovance 2.5/500mg
__label__Other Multivitamin
__label__Other She relates that her dyspnea is better
__label__Other She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.
"__label__Other She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy."

__label__Other Family history:
__label__Other    No significant cardiac disease
__label__Other Social history:
__label__Other    She and her husband are doing well.
__label__Other She has retired.
__label__Other Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.
__label__Other Review of systems:
__label__Other    Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.
"__label__Other Denies edema, PND, orthopnea."
__label__Other Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.
__label__Other Physical examination:
__label__Other -BP: 130/80  
__label__Other -General appearance:   No acute distress.
"__label__Other -Skin:   No rashes, anicteric."
__label__Other -Heent:   Unremarkable
__label__Other -Neck:   CVP 8.
__label__Other No carotid bruits
__label__Other -Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
__label__Other -Cardiac:   S1 S2.
__label__Other No significant murmurs.
__label__Other PMI normal.
"__label__obese.mention.during_dct -Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly"
"__label__Other -Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema"
__label__Other -Neuro:   Non-focal
__label__Other -Pulse: 89  
__label__Other EKG:
__label__Other    Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.
__label__Other Impression:
__label__Other    Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.
__label__Other Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.
__label__Other She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.
__label__Other Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.
"__label__Other At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained."
__label__Other Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication."
__label__Other She relates that she will call our office.

__label__Other Date of Visit: 06/28/2097
__label__Other  Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today.
__label__Other Her daughter Gibbs was translating.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems."
__label__Other She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past.
__label__Other Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house.
__label__Other They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication.
__label__Other When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not.
__label__medication.arb..before_dct Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol.
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning.
__label__Other She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars.
__label__Other She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low.
__label__Other She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat.
__label__Other She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range.
__label__Other She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249.
__label__Other The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner.
__label__Other The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times.
__label__Other She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating.
__label__Other She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations.
__label__Other Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down.
"__label__Other No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness."
__label__Other Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved.
"__label__Other Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response."
__label__Other No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images.
__label__Other From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length.
__label__Other She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid.
__label__Other Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct.
__label__Other The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia.
__label__Other Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not.
__label__Other Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia.
__label__Other She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital.
__label__Other On exam she is in no acute distress.
__label__Other Blood pressure 124/60.
__label__Other Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits.
"__label__Other Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi."
"__label__Other Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs."
"__label__Other Abdomen: Soft, nontender."
__label__Other No CCE.
__label__Other She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy.
__label__Other Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed.
__label__Other Motor 5/5.
"__label__Other Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes."
__label__Other Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid.
__label__Other Sensation intact to light touch.
__label__Other Distal pulses intact.
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen.
__label__Other Continue same.
__label__Other Check Chem-7.
__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct Type 2 diabetes.
__label__Other Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low.
__label__Other Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar.
__label__Other Lightheadedness and dizziness.
__label__Other We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck.
__label__Other She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor.
__label__Other She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.

"__label__Other Patient Name: RICO, NATHAN C                     "
__label__Other MRN: 9190908
__label__Other Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    
__label__Other Dictated By: Leroy Kelly
__label__Other Date of Visit: 11/23/2071
__label__Other Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.
"__label__Other HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069."
"__label__Other This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke."
__label__Other He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.
__label__Other His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.
__label__Other A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
__label__Other Homocysteine was normal.
__label__Other Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
"__label__Other His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy."
__label__Other Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.
__label__Other He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.
__label__Other A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting."
__label__Other This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.
"__label__Other The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated."
__label__Other I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.
__label__Other He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.
__label__Other His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa.
__label__Other Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.
__label__Other Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.
"__label__Other He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful."
"__label__Other He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head."
"__label__Other He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome."
__label__Other His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.
"__label__Other These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time."
__label__Other He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.
__label__Other He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.
__label__Other This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.
__label__Other There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.
"__label__Other He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea."
__label__Other The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.
__label__Other He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.
"__label__Other He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning."
__label__Other He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.
__label__Other He is unable to work.
__label__Other His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.
__label__Other He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.
__label__Other His left arm remains paralyzed.
__label__Other He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.
__label__Other He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.
__label__Other He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily."
__label__Other On exam Nathan is well-appearing.
__label__Other His hair has now grown back.
__label__Other On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.
__label__Other He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.
__label__Other Eye contact is good.
__label__Other On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.
__label__Other There is a left visual field deficit.
__label__Other The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.
__label__Other The tongue protrudes in the midline.
__label__Other The left arm is completely plegic.
__label__Other The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.
__label__Other There is left-sided sensory extinction.
__label__Other Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.
__label__Other Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.
__label__Other We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.
__label__Other Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.
__label__Other I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.
__label__Other There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.
__label__Other Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.
"__label__Other Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear."
__label__Other Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.
__label__Other I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.
__label__Other We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.
"__label__Other If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism."
__label__Other If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.
__label__Other I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.
__label__Other There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.
__label__Other There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
__label__Other The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.
"__label__Other The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep."
__label__Other I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.
__label__Other We will keep an eye on this over time.
__label__Other No other changes are indicated at the moment.
__label__Other I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

"__label__Other She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events."
"__label__Other Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain."
"__label__Other If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan."
__label__Other We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes.
"__label__Other We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us."

__label__Other LEPROSARIUM:              962-85-18
__label__smoker.unknown Dear Dr. Colon:
__label__Other I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.
"__label__Other Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know."
__label__Other He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.
__label__Other During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.
__label__Other He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.
__label__Other He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.
__label__Other Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.
__label__Other In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.
"__label__Other The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes."
__label__Other He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.
__label__Other He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.
"__label__Other He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim."
__label__Other He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.
__label__Other His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.
__label__Other He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.
__label__Other On exam today he is doing quite well.
__label__Other He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.
__label__Other His head and neck exams were unremarkable.
__label__Other His lungs were clear.
__label__Other Heart was regular.
"__label__Other His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound."
__label__Other With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.
"__label__Other There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity."
__label__Other He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.
"__label__Other Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle."
__label__Other He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.
__label__Other This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.
"__label__Other His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar."
"__label__Other In summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity."
__label__Other He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.
"__label__Other Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left."
__label__Other With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.
__label__Other I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.
__label__Other My thanks again for this referral.
__label__Other I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.
__label__Other With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.
__label__Other The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.
__label__Other The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
__label__Other Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.

__label__Other The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.
"__label__Other To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region."
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.
__label__Other This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.
__label__Other I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.
__label__Other I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.
__label__Other This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.
__label__Other These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.
"__label__Other I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found."
__label__Other The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.
"__label__Other However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process."
__label__Other I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.
"__label__Other However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology."
__label__Other I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.
"__label__Other If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board."
__label__Other He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.
__label__Other The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.
"__label__Other In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now."
"__label__Other At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed."
"__label__Other At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way."
__label__Other The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__cad.event.before_dct Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD
__label__Other History of Present Illness
__label__cad.mention.before_dct This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB.
__label__Other Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts.
__label__cad.test.before_dct He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD."
__label__Other There was no PCI option available.
"__label__Other He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted."
__label__Other Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic.
__label__Other He now presented for cath.
__label__cad.test.during_dct Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch.
__label__Other The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%.
__label__Other The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis.
__label__Other LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM.
__label__cad.test.during_dct RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG.
__label__Other The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent.
__label__Other The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized.
__label__Other The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent.
__label__Other He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

__label__Other Dear Miles:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.
__label__Other This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign"
"__label__Other prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status"
__label__Other post total knee replacement.
__label__Other He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
__label__cad.mention.before_dct coronary artery disease.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct His history of coronary artery disease
__label__Other begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
__label__Other in June of 2091.
__label__Other In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
__label__Other and sat down.
"__label__Other He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of"
__label__Other consciousness or edema.
__label__Other Workup at that time included a thallium
__label__Other test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
__label__Other echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.
__label__Other He began therapy
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,"
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin."
__label__Other He had
"__label__Other been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal"
"__label__Other nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA"
__label__Other until this past spring.
__label__Other He actually had done very well with risk
__label__Other factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
__label__Other following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
__label__Other weight.
__label__Other In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
__label__Other up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
__label__Other discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.
__label__Other He stopped
__label__Other working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct nitrate therapy.
__label__Other Since that time he has noted that he has had
__label__Other significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
__label__Other taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.
__label__Other He does note
__label__Other fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
__label__Other night.
__label__Other He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
"__label__Other dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness."
"__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,"
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin."
__label__Other He has no known drug
__label__Other allergies.
__label__Other On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct noted to be 220/100.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct At the present time it is 180/100 with a
"__label__Other Vicente, Kadeem F."
__label__Other MRN: 948-59-58-0
__label__Other Page Two
__label__Other heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.
__label__Other There is no
__label__Other increase in jugular venous pressure.
__label__Other His carotids are free of
__label__Other bruits.
"__label__Other His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,"
"__label__Other and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and"
"__label__Other physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop."
__label__Other Abdominal
__label__Other exam is notable for a ventral hernia.
__label__Other There is no organomegaly and
__label__Other neither are there bruits present.
__label__Other Lower extremities are notable
"__label__Other for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial"
__label__Other pulses with no edema.
__label__Other Skin exam is notable only for the senile
__label__Other angioma.
__label__Other Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
__label__Other is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.
__label__Other MIBI was
__label__Other notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
__label__Other significant ischemia on 5/6/94.
__label__Other The ejection fraction on a gated
__label__Other spect was 57%.
"__label__Other In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new"
__label__Other myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
__label__Other March of 2094.
"__label__Other He could, however, also have developed his"
__label__Other progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
__label__Other his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.
__label__Other I will
__label__Other be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.
__label__Other In
__label__Other either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
__label__Other regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
__label__Other pressure.
__label__Other I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
__label__Other increase to 60 mg p.o.
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other I also would consider further decrease
__label__Other of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
__label__Other assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program.
__label__Other Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
"__label__Other activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route."
__label__Other I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
__label__Other hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
__label__Other risk factor reduction.
__label__Other I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you.
__label__Other It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.

__label__Other MICROBIOLOGY
__label__Other None
__label__Other RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES
__label__Other CXR - No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
__label__Other EKG &#8211; Sinus tachycardia.
__label__Other Rate 106.
"__label__Other Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3."
__label__Other Slightly changed from prior.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap."
"__label__Other She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis."
__label__Other ##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
"__label__Other Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics."
__label__Other A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.
"__label__Other Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L."
__label__Other Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.
"__label__Other Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased."
__label__Other Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic
__label__Other Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination
__label__Other Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day
"__label__Other Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion"
__label__Other Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)
__label__Other ##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.
"__label__Other Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67."
__label__Other Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.
__label__Other Check orthostatics
__label__Other Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.

__label__Other Re: Nancy Xayarath
__label__Other ANC Unit #:  111-64-17
__label__Other Dear Dr. Townsend:
__label__Other 	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity."
__label__Other She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.
__label__Other She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot.
"__label__Other She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot."
__label__Other Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her.
__label__Other She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in.
"__label__Other Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor."
"__label__Other Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098."
__label__Other She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.
__label__Other Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.
__label__Other She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.
"__label__Other She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely."
__label__Other She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.
__label__Other The skin is of normal turgor.
__label__Other She has no active plantar ulcers on 
__label__Other Page two
__label__Other Re:  Nancy Xayarath
"__label__Other Date: February 17, 2100"
__label__Other either foot.
__label__Other At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.
__label__Other No new x-rays were obtained today.
"__label__Other Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot."
"__label__Other Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer."
__label__Other It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.
"__label__Other I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote."
__label__Other I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.
__label__Other We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer.
__label__Other She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime.
__label__Other Thank you kindly for this referral.
"__label__Other Best personal regards,"

__label__Other Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083."
__label__Other She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.
__label__Other She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.
"__label__Other An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads."
"__label__Other Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus."
"__label__Other At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization."
"__label__smoker.current Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation."
__label__Other Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.
__label__Other There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
"__label__Other After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully."
"__label__Other She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s."
"__label__Other She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year."
__label__Other It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.
__label__Other A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.

__label__Other TRANSPLANT FELLOW ADMIT NOTE
"__label__Other HPI: 42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplantation for bronchiectasis in 7/73 transferred from Burlington Obstetrics Gynecology Center for further evaluation of N/V/D, fever and hypoxia."
__label__Other Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function  prompting a recent admission here 1/23 -25/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection.
__label__Other He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission.
__label__Other Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1/25/77.
__label__Other Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge.
__label__Other Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds).
__label__Other He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea.
"__label__Other Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen."
__label__Other GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO.
"__label__Other Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness."
__label__Other Currently no dyspnea at rest.

__label__Other Dear Fitzgerald:
"__label__Other   I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted."
"__label__Other The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses."
"__label__Other There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.
"__label__Other At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time."
"__label__Other That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%."
__label__Other The right side was patent.
"__label__Other With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%."
"__label__Other The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent."
"__label__Other The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal."
"__label__Other Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side."
__label__Other There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.
"__label__Other The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week."
"__label__Other He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup."
__label__Other The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.
__label__Other He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.
"__label__Other Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy."
__label__Other This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.
__label__Other The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.
"__label__Other He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that."
"__label__Other Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week."
"__label__Other He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal."
"__label__Other He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time."
__label__Other The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.
__label__Other His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.
__label__Other He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.
"__label__Other He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below."
"__label__Other Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan."
__label__Other He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.
"__label__Other He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate."
"__label__Other Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting."
"__label__Other Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk."""
"__label__Other At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions."

__label__Other Other Data:
__label__Other    Date of Birth:  01/22/2077
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
__label__Other    1.
"__label__Other Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle."
__label__Other This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.
"__label__Other I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years."
__label__Other Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.
__label__Other We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.
"__label__Other I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway."
__label__Other Impression:
"__label__Other Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities."
"__label__Other We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated."
__label__Other Right leg has not been examined in the past.
"__label__Other Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone."
__label__Other Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.
__label__Other Blood pressure is under reasonable control.
__label__Other Need to check his creatinine and BUN.
"__label__Other If they are okay, then we would leave him alone."
"__label__Other He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Coronary artery disease - stable.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes.
__label__Other Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

__label__Other 	NORTHERN STATE HOSPITAL
__label__Other 	Interval History:
__label__Other    Ms. Kong presents to follow-up her recent hospitalizations.
"__label__Other Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI."
__label__Other The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.
__label__Other Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.
__label__Other On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.
"__label__Other Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA."
__label__Other Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.
__label__Other She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.
"__label__Other However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest."
__label__Other ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).
__label__Other TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.
__label__Other There was a new apical WMA.
__label__Other She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.
__label__Other The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (?
"__label__Other from afib, INR 1.5 on admission)."
__label__Other She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.
__label__Other She was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.
__label__Other She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.
__label__Other She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.
"__label__Other However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits."
__label__Other No F/C or weight loss.
__label__Other She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.
"__label__Other While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat."
__label__Other Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.
"__label__Other However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week."
__label__Other She denies LE edema.
__label__Other She's tolerating all medications well.
__label__Other Home BS checks have been running 90-130.
__label__Other Past medical history:
__label__Other    - GBS AoV endocarditis s/p aortic root replacement with 20mm homograft

__label__Other 	Impression:
"__label__Other    Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months."
"__label__Other Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning."
"__label__Other To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home)."
__label__Other She has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.
"__label__Other If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix."
"__label__Other In terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced."
__label__Other She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.
"__label__Other In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement."
__label__Other She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.
"__label__Other With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced."
"__label__Other If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run."
__label__Other She'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
"__label__Other Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o, who p/w dizziness that began 2 to 3 weeks ago."

"__label__Other During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious."

__label__Other Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.
"__label__Other Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed."

__label__Other ASSESSMENT
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status."
__label__Other Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated.
__label__Other He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days.
"__label__Other This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia."
"__label__Other Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process."
"__label__Other Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure."
__label__Other Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g.
"__label__medication.arb..before_dct Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF."
__label__Other Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.
"__label__Other amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy."
"__label__Other Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys."
__label__Other Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF.
"__label__Other Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc."
__label__Other PLAN
__label__Other #) Acture Renal Failure
__label__Other -Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs
__label__Other -D/c naproxen use.
__label__Other -Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters.
__label__Other If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate.
__label__Other Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.

__label__medication.metformin..before_dct -Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

__label__Other Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides.
"__label__Other Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty."
__label__Other He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.

__label__Other ASSESSMENT:
__label__Other Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.
__label__Other PLAN:
__label__Other 1.
"__label__Other His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department."
__label__Other Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys.
__label__Other Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys.
__label__Other Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery.
__label__Other Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm.
__label__Other Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.
__label__Other 2.
"__label__Other We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future."
"__label__Other If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys."
__label__Other We are awaiting his expert opinion.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk.
"__label__Other Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained."
__label__Other However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.
__label__Other 5.
"__label__Other If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis."
__label__Other We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

__label__Other Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
"__label__Other He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL."
__label__Other His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.
__label__Other His options are:
"__label__Other 1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks"
__label__Other 2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
__label__Other 3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication

__label__Other Stage IVB 
__label__Other Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 
__label__Other Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 
__label__Other History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.
"__label__Other On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time."
__label__Other The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
__label__Other Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
"__label__Other On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma."
__label__Other Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
"__label__Other Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease."
__label__Other On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
"__label__Other This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space."
__label__Other The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
__label__Other There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
__label__Other PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
__label__Other The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
__label__Other He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.
__label__Other Problems/PMH:
__label__Other Repair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080

__label__Other Assessment and Plan:
__label__Other 72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer.
__label__Other He is doing quite well.
"__label__Other Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss."
"__label__Other After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging."
"__label__Other If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment."
"__label__Other If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards."
__label__Other He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.
__label__Other RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

__label__Other 10/26/2073
__label__Other To Whom It May Concern:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease."
"__label__Other He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center."
__label__Other This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.
"__label__Other Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease."
"__label__Other He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently."
__label__Other He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.
__label__Other He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds."
"__label__Other He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents."
"__label__Other He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer."
__label__Other Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o."
"__label__Other daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.arb..during_dct daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o."
__label__Other daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o.
__label__Other daily.
__label__Other He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.
"__label__smoker.past His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago."
__label__Other He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.
__label__Other He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.
__label__Other He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress."
__label__obese.mention.after_dct He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.
__label__Other His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.
__label__Other He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
"__label__Other He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop."
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated."
__label__Other His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.
__label__Other He has good distal pulsations.
__label__Other His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.
__label__Other Laboratory values are not available today.
__label__Other ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.
__label__Other He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.
__label__Other No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now."
"__label__Other This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS."
"__label__Other Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS."
"__label__Other However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease."
"__label__Other As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning."
"__label__Other If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week."
"__label__Other This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074."
"__label__Other With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o."
__label__Other This medication should be continued through all surgery.
"__label__Other Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o."
__label__Other daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so."
__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.
__label__Other I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication."
"__label__Other We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary."
"__label__Other Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis."
"__label__Other As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future."
__label__Other I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.
__label__Other He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.
__label__Other Thank you.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

"__label__Other Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement ."
__label__Other She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity."

__label__Other She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.
"__label__Other Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today."
"__label__Other Today, she feels reasonably well."
"__label__Other She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds."

"__label__Other Dear Nurse Rivas, "
__label__Other We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
__label__Other The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures."

__label__Other She was last seen here in December 2091.
"__label__Other Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy."
__label__Other Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.
"__label__Other However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms."
"__label__Other Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area."
"__label__Other She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved."
__label__Other She denies any recent seizures.
"__label__Other After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents."

__label__Other Assessment and Recommendations:
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct 60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures."
__label__Other Her clinical examination remains intact.
"__label__Other She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin."
"__label__Other Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation."
"__label__Other Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability."
"__label__Other Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study."
"__label__Other If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days)."
"__label__Other After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG."
"__label__Other She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months."
"__label__Other We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention."
__label__Other The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.
__label__Other (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)
"__label__Other Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression."
"__label__Other Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin."
"__label__Other Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam."
"__label__Other Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan."
__label__Other Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.
"__label__Other As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time."

__label__Other Dear Dr. Dillon:
"__label__cad.mention.during_dct I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure."
"__label__Other Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms."
"__label__Other She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea."
"__label__Other She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o.
"__label__Other q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o."

__label__Other perspective.
__label__Other Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
__label__Other undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps.
__label__Other Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.
__label__Other This has been
__label__Other reevaluated and he has been stable.
__label__Other The fourth polyp will need to
__label__Other be removed at a later time.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct At this point, his aspirin has been"
__label__Other discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
__label__Other discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests.
"__label__Other His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,"
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd."
__label__Other He is aware of a
__label__Other belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
__label__Other exertional or other related symptoms.
__label__Other He is reasonably active but
__label__Other somewhat limited by his claudication.
"__label__Other On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,"
__label__Other a heart rate of 65 and regular.
__label__Other Head and neck were unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
__label__Other at 30 degrees.
__label__Other PMI is normal.
__label__Other S1 and S2 are normal with a
__label__Other physiologic split.
__label__Other There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
__label__Other murmur at the left sternal border.
__label__Other Abdominal exam was
__label__Other unremarkable.
__label__Other Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.
__label__Other His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
__label__Other rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
__label__Other intraventricular conduction delay.
__label__Other Page 2
__label__Other I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.
__label__Other It would be of
__label__Other value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
__label__Other 2069.
__label__Other He had minimal ischemia at that time.
__label__Other There are no symptoms
__label__Other that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
__label__Other see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings.
"__label__Other If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me."
__label__Other Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
__label__Other Kindest personal regards.
"__label__Other Sincerely yours,"

__label__Other He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09/84 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off.
__label__Other His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years.
__label__cad.test.before_dct He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory.
__label__Other His LV was normal with EF of 59%.
__label__Other He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis.
__label__Other There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX.
__label__Other He had been asymptomatic.
__label__Other The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty.

__label__Other 	Reason for visit:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct    Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation."
__label__Other Interval History:
__label__cad.mention.before_dct    He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097.
"__label__Other At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation.
__label__Other Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer.
"__label__Other His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch."
__label__Other He required re-exploration for bleeding.
"__label__Other He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone."
__label__Other His IABP was removed a few days post operatively.
"__label__Other He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%."
__label__Other He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab.
"__label__Other Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV."
"__label__Other The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents."
__label__Other His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function.
__label__Other He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability.
__label__Other He was followed by Dr. Hardin.
__label__Other His HIT assay was borderline negative.
"__label__Other He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban."
"__label__Other Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux."
"__label__Other A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation."
__label__Other He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20.
__label__Other He was discharged from rehab on June 5th.
__label__Other On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA.
"__label__Other His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half."
"__label__Other He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations."
"__label__Other He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees."
__label__Other The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath.
__label__Other His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid.
"__label__Other However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%."
__label__Other 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation.

"__label__Other Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits."
"__label__Other Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia."

"__label__Other Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG."
__label__Other Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.
__label__Other Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.
__label__Other Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.
__label__Other Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.
__label__Other Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.
__label__Other Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.
__label__Other Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.

__label__Other percussion.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-"
"__label__Other displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or"

"__label__Other Unfortunately, he did"
__label__Other take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his

__label__Other MRN:  0261948
__label__Other Date of Visit:  01/26/2098
__label__Other Background:
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
__label__Other She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease.
"__label__Other She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain."
__label__Other Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration.
"__label__Other She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70."
"__label__Other Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face."
__label__cad.event.before_dct The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095.
__label__Other Slowly these lesions healed.
__label__Other Interim Issues:
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis."
__label__cad.event.before_dct In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed.
__label__Other Recovering from surgery has been slow.
__label__Other But it has been steady and uncomplicated.
"__label__Other She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home."
__label__Other She has had no recurrent chest pain.
__label__Other She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage.
"__label__Other She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se."
__label__Other She healed well postoperatively.
__label__Other She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape.
__label__Other Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR.
"__label__Other In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's."
__label__Other She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands.
__label__Other What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis.
__label__Other She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily.
__label__Other She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily.
__label__Other She has had no worsening swallowing.
"__label__Other She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion."
__label__Other She sleeps on two pillows.
__label__Other She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth.
__label__Other She continues on omeprazole.
__label__Other Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative.
__label__Other MEDS:
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Amlodipine 5 MG QD

__label__Other She has telangiectasias over her face.
__label__Other She looks well to me.
__label__Other Her color is good and she smiles easily.
"__label__Other She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes."
"__label__Other Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here."
__label__Other Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well.
__label__Other But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma.

"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks."
__label__Other Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained.
"__label__Other I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim."
"__label__Other Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient."
__label__Other She and her husband agree with this plan.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Givens:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up."
__label__Other VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.
"__label__Other Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous."
"__label__Other For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest."
"__label__Other The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation."
"__label__Other He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers."
__label__Other He has managed to lose 6 lbs.
"__label__Other by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better."
__label__Other GE reflux is very well controlled.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar."
__label__Other On Examination:  He is well appearing.
"__label__Other Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored."
__label__Other Oropharynx is clear.
__label__Other Conjunctivae are clear.
"__label__Other Trachea is midline, no goiter."
"__label__Other Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla."
"__label__Other Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR."
"__label__obese.mention.during_dct Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass."
"__label__Other Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis."
__label__Other Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.
"__label__Other Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14."
__label__Other Weight is 238 lbs.
__label__obese.bmi.during_dct (BMI 38).
__label__Other Impression:
__label__Other 1.
"__label__Other Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia."
"__label__Other I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent."
"__label__Other I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this."
"__label__Other I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux."
"__label__Other If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup."
__label__obese.mention.before_dct The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.
__label__Other I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs.
"__label__Other to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32."
"__label__Other Hence, he has his work cut out for him."
__label__Other 2.
__label__obese.mention.before_dct Obesity - As above.
__label__Other 3.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other GE reflux - As mentioned.
__label__Other 6.
"__label__Other Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis."
__label__Other Recommendations:
__label__Other Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.
__label__Other Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d.
__label__Other - as 20 mg b.i.d.

"__label__Other RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda"
__label__Other MRN: 892-76-95-4
__label__Other Dear Usha:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in"
__label__Other my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary
__label__Other artery bypass surgery.
"__label__Other As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a"
__label__Other terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest
__label__Other discomfort.
__label__Other One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was
__label__Other fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.
__label__Other Both of
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.
__label__Other I
__label__Other am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier
__label__Other Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine.
"__label__Other Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort."
__label__Other She
__label__Other continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking
__label__Other corticosteroid shots for that.
"__label__Other On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly"
__label__Other woman.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.
__label__Other Jugular venous
__label__Other pulse is not observed.
__label__Other She has bilateral carotid bruits.
__label__Other Chest
__label__Other exam is clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a"
__label__Other physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
__label__Other sternal border.
__label__Other Abdominal exam is benign.
__label__Other Peripheral exam shows
__label__Other trace pedal edema.
__label__Other EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute.
"__label__Other There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old"
__label__Other anterolateral MI.
__label__Other The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared
__label__Other with previous tracings.
"__label__Other MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085"
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a
__label__Other Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.
__label__Other If she can
"__label__Other exercise on this test, that would be even better."
__label__Other When the
"__label__Other results are back, I will get back you regarding further"
__label__Other recommendations.
__label__Other My hope is that we will not have to
__label__Other revascularize her again.
"__label__Other If we do, I am hoping to do so with"
__label__Other potential angioplasty and stenting.
"__label__Other In the meantime, I have"
__label__medication.statin..after_dct switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes
__label__Other of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100.
__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.
__label__Other I also suggested to her in
__label__Other the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know
__label__Other the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of
__label__Other her steroid injection for her back.
__label__Other Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
__label__Other regarding this patient.
"__label__Other Again, thank you for referring her to"

"__label__Other Florence Mildred Yuan, M.D."

__label__Other 02 Weymouth Dr
"__label__Other Plymouth, IN  46368"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Yuan:
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation."
__label__Other I will be sending a copy of this letter to
__label__Other Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group."
"__label__Other His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94."
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d.."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d."
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.before_dct He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.
"__label__smoker.never He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese."
"__label__Other He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath."
"__label__Other His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia."
"__label__Other His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well."
"__label__Other He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH."
__label__Other Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.
__label__Other The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.
"__label__Other The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar."
"__label__Other The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal."
"__label__Other His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so."
"__label__Other He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago."
__label__Other He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.
__label__Other Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.
"__label__Other He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085."
__label__Other Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.
__label__Other He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.
__label__Other His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct On exam, he is obese but comfortable."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds."
__label__Other Head and neck are unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
__label__Other PMI is normal.
__label__Other S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
__label__Other There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
__label__Other Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
__label__obese.mention.before_dct The abdomen is obese.
__label__Other Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
__label__Other Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
__label__Other Distal pulses are normal.
"__label__Other His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3."
__label__Other He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.
__label__Other The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.
__label__Other This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.
__label__Other We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.
"__label__Other In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible."
__label__Other He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.
"__label__Other I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone."
"__label__Other We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available."
__label__Other I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
"__label__Other If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me."
__label__Other We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
__label__Other Kindest personal regards.

"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady."
__label__Other She is
__label__Other symptomatic only when she walks.
__label__Other Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the
"__label__Other toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the"
"__label__Other wide-based, at times veering gait."
__label__Other It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are

"__label__Other It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given"
__label__Other that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she

"__label__Other However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,"
"__label__Other she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she"

__label__Other DOB:               3/22/68
__label__Other Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:
__label__Other I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.
"__label__Other The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again."
__label__Other The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.
__label__Other The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.
__label__Other He has never worn compression stockings.
__label__Other He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.
__label__Other To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.
"__label__Other The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT."
__label__Other There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.
__label__Other He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.
"__label__Other He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed."
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair."
"__label__Other The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding."
__label__Other The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.
"__label__smoker.past He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia."
__label__obese.mention.before_dct On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.
__label__Other He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.
__label__Other He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.
__label__Other He has a huge protuberant abdomen.
__label__Other There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
"__label__Other He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses."
__label__Other His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.
__label__Other On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.
"__label__Other He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right."
__label__Other He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.
"__label__Other He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left."
__label__Other The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.
__label__Other The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.
__label__Other The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.
"__label__Other It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds."
"__label__Other In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux."
"__label__Other In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds."
__label__Other In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.
__label__Other Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration."
__label__Other Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.
__label__Other I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.
__label__Other Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.
"__label__obese.mention.after_dct This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs."
"__label__Other All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling."
__label__Other The solution to this problem is not an easy one.
__label__Other With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.
"__label__Other Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device."
__label__Other If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.
__label__Other I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.
__label__Other I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.
"__label__Other I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important."
__label__Other I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.
__label__Other It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.
"__label__Other If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know."
"__label__Other Sincerely,"
"__label__Other Michael D. Roe, M.D."

__label__Other LEFT ATRIUM 
__label__Other There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.
"__label__Other AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT "

__label__Other The aortic valve is tricuspid.
__label__Other There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler.
__label__Other LEFT VENTRICLE 
__label__Other The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
__label__Other The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.
__label__Other There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.
__label__Other There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant.

"__label__Other    In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device."
"__label__Other She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events."
"__label__Other Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol."

__label__Other The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.
"__label__Other Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted"
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask."

__label__Other She has rales
__label__Other halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.
__label__Other Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.
__label__Other Abdomen is obese but soft.
__label__Other Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees.
__label__Other Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.
"__label__Other On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual"
__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.

"__label__Other LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit"
"__label__Other of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1."
__label__Other BNP was noted at
__label__Other 700.
"__label__Other Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was"
__label__Other less than assay.
"__label__Other However, labs were obtained within half an hour"
"__label__Other of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6."
__label__Other Urinalysis
__label__Other was negative and urine HCG was negative.
__label__Other EKG was sinus

"__label__smoker.unknown HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care."
__label__Other He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.
__label__Other Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.
__label__Other Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.
"__label__Other Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms."
"__label__Other He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16."
"__label__Other He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia."
"__label__Other Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever."
__label__Other He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.
__label__Other He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.
__label__Other He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.
__label__Other This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.
"__label__smoker.unknown PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems."

__label__Other Sinuses: Non-tender.
__label__Other Nasal turbinates: Benign.
"__label__Other Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen."
"__label__Other Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema."
"__label__Other Neck: Supple, without adenopathy."
"__label__Other I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at."
__label__Other Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.
__label__Other Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.
"__label__Other Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop."
"__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having."
__label__Other I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.
__label__Other He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.

__label__Other She has a history of TIAs and
__label__Other was seeing the neurologist today for follow up.
__label__Other She has not had recent TIA symptoms
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.
__label__Other Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she
__label__Other has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she
__label__Other walks about one block.
__label__Other The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both
__label__Other sides of her chest.
"__label__Other It is not severe, sharp chest pain."
__label__Other It does not radiate to her back.
__label__Other There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain.
"__label__Other No PND, orthopnea or edema."
__label__Other The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago.
__label__Other She has a history of TIAs and our
__label__Other goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a
__label__Other low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She is on aspirin and Plavix.
__label__Other She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.

__label__Other Her blood
__label__Other pressure is 160/70.
__label__Other Neck supple without JVD or bruits.
"__label__Other Lungs clear without wheezes,"
__label__Other rales or rhonchi.
"__label__Other Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur"
__label__Other or gallop.
"__label__Other Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly."
__label__Other No edema.
__label__Other Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct which sounds convincing for exertional angina.
__label__Other She has not had any symptoms in over
__label__Other two weeks.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
__label__Other b.i.d.
__label__Other She should stop it if she
__label__Other feels lightheaded on the medication.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d.
__label__Other We
__label__Other will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT.

__label__Other 	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23
__label__Other Dear Dr. Givens:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease."
__label__Other He has managed to lose 3 lbs.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control."
"__label__Other His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees."
__label__Other They both attribute it to the Prilosec.
__label__Other He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.
"__label__Other He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work."
__label__Other Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.
"__label__Other No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers."
__label__Other Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.
"__label__Other On examination, he is well appearing."
__label__Other Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored.
__label__Other Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff.
__label__Other Conjunctivae are clear.
__label__Other Oropharynx is clear.
"__label__Other Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy."
__label__Other Back:  Normal configuration.
"__label__Other Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases."
"__label__Other Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop."
__label__Other JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.
"__label__Other Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass."
"__label__Other Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing."
"__label__Other Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range."
__label__Other My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.
__label__Other Impression:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.
"__label__Other Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis."
"__label__Other However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy."
"__label__Other There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes."
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
"__label__Other If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this."
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.
__label__Other 4.
"__label__Other Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled."
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Chronic cough.
__label__Other 6.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Diabetes - Better controlled.
__label__Other 7.
__label__obese.mention.before_dct Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.
"__label__Other As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress."
__label__Other Recommendations:
__label__Other Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d.
"__label__Other dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake."
__label__Other Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.
"__label__Other Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated."
__label__Other It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.
__label__Other Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.

__label__Other Attending: Andersen
__label__Other HPI: 
__label__Other The patient is a 79yF with ESRD on HD.
__label__Other She is being dialyzed via a right brachiocephalic fistula that was created in Nov 2075.
__label__Other The patient is a very poor historian and the subsequent information has been collected from the medical record.
"__label__Other While the fistula is beng used successfully for dialysis, it has undergone aneurysmal dilatation and the patient has also developed non-healing areas over the fistula at points of access."
__label__Other There is note made in the chart that the patient has had difficulty with recurrent outflow stenosis and for this she seems to have undergone angioplasty at Brooks Hospital (no record in LMR) recently.
__label__Other The patient does not have any complaints.

__label__Other RE:  Christine Olivier
__label__Other      MR #652-33-21-5
__label__Other Dear Dr. Arteaga:
__label__Other Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
__label__Other regarding her current cardiac condition.
__label__Other As her history is well
"__label__Other known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records."
__label__Other Mrs.
__label__Other Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
__label__cad.mention.before_dct coronary artery disease.
__label__Other After several catheterizations in the
__label__cad.mention.before_dct 2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct (done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071"
__label__cad.mention.before_dct showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
__label__Other was managed medically.
"__label__Other However, she suffered a non-Q wave"
__label__Other myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
__label__Other underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
__label__Other artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
__label__Other bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
"__label__Other her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse"
__label__Other marginal branch.
__label__Other She underwent repeat catheterization in February
__label__Other of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
__label__Other but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.
__label__Other She
__label__Other underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
"__label__Other proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis"
__label__Other with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
__label__cad.test.before_dct and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
__label__Other The saphenous
__label__Other vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
"__label__Other stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft"
__label__Other to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
__label__Other saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.
__label__Other The left

__label__Other It is certainly possible that her fatigue and

__label__Other Record date: 2151-01-25
"__label__Other  January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:"
__label__Other 	He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas.
__label__Other He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago.
__label__Other Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on.
__label__Other This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein.
__label__Other He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions.
__label__Other A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion.
__label__Other Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma.
__label__Other The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
__label__Other His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
"__label__smoker.never He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week."
"__label__Other His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143."
"__label__medication.sulfonylureas..during_dct His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin."
__label__Other He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
__label__Other His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis.
__label__Other He has had some mild recent weight loss.
"__label__Other He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease."
__label__Other His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
__label__Other I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time.
"__label__Other With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation."
"__label__Other He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy."
"__label__Other I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter."
"__label__Other After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT."
__label__Other He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us.
__label__Other This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up.
__label__Other I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
__label__Other I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

"__label__cad.mention.before_dct HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management."
__label__Other She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.
__label__Other She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.
"__label__Other She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal."
__label__Other There is no operative report from the procedure.
"__label__Other Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed."
__label__Other Tissue appeared fairly healthy.
"__label__Other She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle."

__label__Other The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.
"__label__Other If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics."
"__label__Other However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware."
"__label__Other After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal."
"__label__Other Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis."
__label__Other Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.
"__label__Other We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service."
"__label__Other Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure."
__label__Other Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

__label__Other 33 y.o.
"__label__Other Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum."
"__label__Other All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control."
"__label__Other He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen."
__label__Other The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.
"__label__Other His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing."
__label__Other RECOMMENDATIONS:
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.
"__label__Other If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose"
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
__label__Other No concentrated sweets diet
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
__label__Other Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
__label__Other Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
__label__Other Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
__label__Other Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service

__label__Other which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.
__label__Other There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.
__label__Other Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080.
"__label__Other He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate."
__label__Other There was no evidence of ischemia.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct."
__label__Other EKG:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct     shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI."

__label__Other He is on a good medical regimen.
__label__Other Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.
__label__Other He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.
__label__Other He does have some trace pedal edema.
__label__Other His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.
"__label__Other I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today."
__label__Other My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.
__label__Other Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

__label__Other learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
__label__Other presenting for follow up of his DVT.
__label__Other The patient's current medical 
__label__Other problems include:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Recent DVT.
__label__Other The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
__label__Other      1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.
__label__Other The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
__label__Other      previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
__label__Other      car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
__label__Other      previously over the recent few weeks.
__label__Other The patient stated he awoke 
__label__Other      in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
__label__Other      quadriceps and right calf.
__label__Other He later developed progressive swelling 
__label__Other      of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
__label__Other      department.
__label__Other He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
__label__Other      confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.
__label__Other He was 
__label__Other      admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.
__label__Other The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
__label__Other      time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
__label__Other      sent off which was negative.
__label__Other The patient currently returns to me 
__label__Other      complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.
__label__Other He states that 
__label__Other      he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
__label__Other      occur during his hospital course.
__label__Other The patient was also angry and 
__label__Other      upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.
__label__Other I 
__label__Other      explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
__label__Other      his emergency department visit.
__label__Other I called all of the parties 
__label__Other      responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
__label__Other      occurred.
__label__Other 2.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension.
__label__Other The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct      including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE "
__label__Other      inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
__label__Other      discontinued recently.
"__label__Other With a discontinuation of his drinking, the "
__label__Other      patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
__label__Other 3.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
__label__Other I recently started the patient on 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      insulin.
__label__Other He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
__label__Other      did not make his visit.
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
__label__Other      the morning and 15 units of regular.
__label__Other In the evening he takes 10 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      units of NPH and 10 units of regular.
__label__Other The patient does not yet have 
__label__Other      a home glucometer.
__label__Other We will arrange for this.

__label__Other Lungs: clear to

"__label__Other Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds."
__label__Other Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
__label__Other significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.
__label__Other Impression:
__label__Other 1)   DVT.
"__label__Other Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT "
"__label__Other      check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT."
__label__Other      encouraged the patient to elevate the leg.
__label__Other My feeling is that the DVT 
__label__Other      has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
__label__Other      therapeutic at the present time.
__label__Other I have arranged for the patient to 
"__label__Other      follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat "
__label__Other      check of his PT.
__label__Other I left instructions that I should be called 
"__label__Other      immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the "
__label__Other      patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
__label__Other      cane to help with ambulation.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct 2)   Adult onset diabetes.
__label__Other I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
__label__Other      next office visit.
__label__Other A finger stick in the office approximately three 
__label__Other      hours after eating is 253.
__label__Other I feel this is still too elevated.
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.
__label__Other      will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
__label__Other      adjustments in his medications at that time.

__label__Other    Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI.
__label__Other We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention.
"__label__Other We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death."
__label__Other He understands and has agreed to proceed.
__label__Other We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation.
__label__Other We have had a long discussion in this regard.
__label__Other We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly.
__label__Other His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.
__label__Other Sotalol is the best option at this time.
"__label__Other We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079."
__label__Other If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load.
__label__Other We will assess after his angiogram.
"__label__Other We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis."
"__label__Other We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status."
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

__label__Other Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.
__label__Other I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.
"__label__Other CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities."
__label__Other He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.
"__label__Other If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later."
__label__Other This is relieved by sitting.
__label__Other It will happen when walking as well.
__label__Other This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.
"__label__Other He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls."
"__label__Other Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist."
__label__Other PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.
"__label__Other ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien."
__label__Other FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.
"__label__medication.arb..before_dct CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s."
__label__Other and Selexa.
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.
__label__Other BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.
__label__Other EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.
__label__smoker.past He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.
__label__Other He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.
__label__Other He has no HIV risk factors.
__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.
__label__Other He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.
__label__Other He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.
__label__Other When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.
"__label__Other There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms."
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.
__label__Other Pulse of 60 and regular.
__label__Other Carotids 2+ without bruits.
__label__Other Mental status:  Unremarkable.
"__label__Other Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s."
__label__Other No evidence of retinopathy.
__label__Other Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.
__label__Other Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.
__label__Other Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.
__label__Other Rapid alternating movements intact.
__label__Other Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.
__label__Other Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.
"__label__Other The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses."
__label__Other Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.
__label__Other Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.
__label__Other He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.
__label__Other He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.
__label__Other DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).
__label__Other Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.
__label__Other The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT:  
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Neuropathy.
__label__Other The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.
__label__Other He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.
"__label__Other He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy."
__label__Other There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.
"__label__Other I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors."
__label__Other I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.
__label__Other He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.
__label__Other I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.
"__label__Other Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree."
__label__Other The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.
__label__Other DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

__label__Other and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.
__label__Other She
__label__Other has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent
__label__Other infections.
__label__Other She is most concerned about having cancer.
__label__Other She is scheduled to see Dr.
__label__Other Quezada March 24th.
__label__Other The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have
__label__Other been issues going around the housing projects.
__label__Other A 14-year-old girl was raped and
__label__Other one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment.
__label__Other She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.
__label__Other She did not file a
__label__Other police report.
__label__Other As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.
__label__Other reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix
__label__Other approximately one week ago.
__label__Other She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet
__label__Other sporadically but not on a regular basis.
__label__Other She denies any chest pressure or
__label__Other palpitations.
__label__Other She denies any shortness of breath.
__label__Other She denies any problems with
__label__Other pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.
__label__Other Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
"__label__Other No murmurs, gallops or rubs."
__label__Other UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.
__label__Other Her
__label__Other ankle reveals trace edema on the left.
__label__Other Her right extremity is warm to palpation.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct (1)  Hypertension.
__label__Other Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.
__label__Other This
__label__Other      may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.
__label__Other I have
__label__Other      restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d.
__label__Other on a regular
__label__Other      basis.
__label__Other (2)  Anxiety.
__label__Other I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try
__label__Other      to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.
__label__Other (3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
__label__Other She had a urine culture submitted today.
__label__Other She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.
__label__Other      will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.
__label__Other I attempted to
__label__Other      reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current
__label__Other      recurrent infections.
__label__Other It is more likely due to her cystocele.
__label__Other (4)  Peripheral vascular disease.
__label__Other This appears stable.
__label__Other She remains off the
__label__Other      cigarettes.
__label__Other (5)  ASCVD.
__label__Other She remains without symptoms.
__label__Other (6)  GERD.
__label__Other She remains on the Prilosec.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct (7)  Hyperlipidemia.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct She remains on Lipitor.
__label__Other She should have a repeat
__label__Other      cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.
__label__Other (8)  Borderline high sugar.
__label__Other The patient should also have this rechecked with the
__label__Other      new physician in the fall.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Galvan:
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease."
"__label__Other He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks."
"__label__Other Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances."
"__label__Other No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections."
__label__Other No reflux symptoms.
"__label__Other Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months."
"__label__Other He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells."
"__label__Other Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.
"__label__Other On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self."
"__label__Other Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular."
__label__Other Conjunctivae are clear.
__label__Other Sinuses nontender.
__label__Other Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.
"__label__Other Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates."
__label__Other No goiter or adenopathy.
__label__Other Back:  Normal configuration.
"__label__Other Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes."
"__label__Other Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3."
"__label__Other Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass."
"__label__Other Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema."
__label__Other Skin:  Well tanned.
"__label__Other Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3."
"__label__Other CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries."
__label__Other Impression:
"__label__Other Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair."

"__label__Other RE:Craft, Lloyd"
__label__Other MRN:26649180
__label__Other Dear Dr. Short:
__label__Other Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr.
__label__Other Craft for the 
__label__Other possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.
"__label__Other As you know, he "
"__label__Other is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical "
__label__Other history for a rheumatological disease.
"__label__Other His past medical history, "
"__label__Other briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that "
"__label__Other time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and "
__label__Other he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
"__label__Other characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-"
__label__Other stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.
__label__Other All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.
__label__Other He was 
__label__Other treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
"__label__Other that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his "
__label__Other symptoms and seizures went away.
"__label__Other Since that time, he has had a "
__label__Other recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
"__label__Other neck, pressure within his head."
__label__Other He considers himself to have 
"__label__Other vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, "
"__label__Other numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive "
__label__Other salivation and increased appetite.
"__label__Other In describing his headache, he "
__label__Other noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
__label__Other has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
__label__Other quality.
__label__Other It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
"__label__Other associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias."
__label__Other There is no 
__label__Other family history of migraines as well.
__label__Other Also during his headache 
"__label__Other events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any "
__label__Other nausea or vomiting.
__label__Other Past medical history:  As per above.
__label__Other Medicval issues include 
"__label__Other bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic "
"__label__Other gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of "
__label__Other migraine headaches.
"__label__Other His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, "
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n."
__label__Other and 
__label__Other prednisone p.r.n.
"__label__Other He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol."
__label__Other There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
__label__Other use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
__label__Other remission.
__label__Other 3-16-14
__label__Other Page 2
__label__Other Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
__label__Other mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.
__label__Other Social history:  He is a former stage manager.
"__label__Other Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3."
__label__Other Attention 
__label__Other was normal.
"__label__Other Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic "
__label__Other errors.
__label__Other There is no memory deficit or agnosia.
__label__Other The patient gave 
__label__Other a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
__label__Other status testing was performed.
__label__Other Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
__label__Other fields were full.
__label__Other Disks were sharp.
__label__Other Fundus was clear.
__label__Other Extraocular movements were intact.
__label__Other There was no nystagmus.
__label__Other He 
__label__Other had normal facial sensation and symmetry.
__label__Other Hearing was grossly 
__label__Other normal.
"__label__Other Uvula, tongue and palate were midline."
__label__Other Motor examination 
__label__Other revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.
__label__Other Deep tendon 
__label__Other reflexes were symmetrical.
__label__Other There was no upper motor neuron sign.
__label__Other Coordination and gait were normal.
"__label__Other Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history "
__label__Other of lupus in the past.
__label__Other His recent blood work shows that his 
__label__Other double-stranded DNA was negative.
__label__Other Taking into consideration his 
__label__Other current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
__label__Other evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular

__label__Other        Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.
__label__Other He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.
__label__Other He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081.
__label__Other He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects.
__label__Other Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.

"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan."
__label__Other PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise.
__label__Other Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min.
__label__Other Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec).
__label__Other 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired.
__label__Other Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day.
__label__Other Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed.
__label__Other Chest pain did not occur.
__label__Other REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.

__label__Other First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test.
__label__Other Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited."
__label__Other SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size.
__label__Other There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest.
__label__Other The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study.
__label__Other Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study.
__label__Other CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia.

__label__smoker.unknown HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.
__label__Other She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.
"__label__Other Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving."
__label__Other She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.
"__label__Other According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention."
__label__Other She denies any significant pain in the leg.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well."
"__label__Other The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever."
"__label__Other The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition."
__label__Other She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.
__label__Other The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.
__label__Other The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.
"__label__Other She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing."
__label__Other The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.
"__label__Other Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery."
__label__Other The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.
"__label__Other In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things."
__label__Other There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.
__label__Other We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

__label__Other Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.
__label__Other Assessment:
"__label__Other  64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back."""
__label__Other Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.
__label__Other No other major symptoms.
__label__Other Plan:
__label__Other #
__label__Other  SOB
__label__Other Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.
"__label__Other Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday."
"__label__Other Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection."
"__label__Other Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea)."
__label__Other -Large acute PE ruled out with CT
__label__Other -?
"__label__Other of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea"
__label__Other -CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
"__label__Other -CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload."
__label__Other BNP is not very high.
"__label__Other However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress."
__label__Other Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
"__label__Other -Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow."
__label__Other Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.
"__label__Other -Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) "
__label__Other  NSCLC
"__label__Other Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer."
__label__Other Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.
"__label__Other -F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey"
__label__Other -Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.
__label__Other She has been doing very well.
__label__Other She has been exercising and has lost from 
__label__Other 200 to 170 pounds.
__label__Other She is feeling very well.
"__label__Other Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT."
__label__Other He did not find the 
__label__Other first ETT acceptable.
__label__cad.test.before_dct The second ETT was grossly positive.
__label__Other As a result 
"__label__Other of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on "
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a "
__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct nitrate.
__label__Other She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
__label__Other pain that she was having before when she went up steps.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct She did have hyperlipidemia.
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct We have put her on Lipitor, which has "
__label__Other provided some control.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which "
__label__Other is not an excellent ratio.
"__label__Other Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal "
__label__Other limits.
__label__Other She also has right shoulder lipoma.
__label__Other This has become apparent since she 
__label__Other lost so much weight.
__label__Other She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
__label__Other recommended Dr. Dawson.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is "
"__label__Other 120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64."
__label__Other Neck is supple.
__label__Other There 
__label__Other is no lymphadenopathy.
__label__Other Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs."
__label__Other Abdomen is soft and nontender.
__label__Other There is no hepatosplenomegaly.

__label__Other Premarin and Synthroid.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Weight loss.
__label__Other She will continue to exercise.
__label__Other I suspect she is going 
__label__Other to lose more weight.
__label__Other This is excellent.
__label__Other 3.
__label__cad.mention.after_dct Coronary artery disease.
__label__Other Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
__label__Other cardiac catheterization.
"__label__Other It is his opinion, and I must concur that "
__label__Other this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.
__label__Other She is going to 
__label__Other delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
__label__Other done on this variety of medical issues.

__label__Other Disposition and Plans
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.
"__label__Other I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can."
__label__Other I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.
__label__Other His PSA is low and will continue to follow.
"__label__Other If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out"
__label__Other 2.
"__label__Other Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease."
__label__Other He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past.
__label__Other I will broach this issue next time again
__label__Other 3.
"__label__Other DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,."
"__label__Other He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton."
__label__Other Will check lipids.
__label__Other Will continue to monitor BP.
__label__Other Will start aspirin when he is willing.
__label__Other Plan to follow up with patient by email
__label__Other will see in clinic RTC in 3 months
__label__Other Eddie Zajac MD 94212

__label__Other OFFICE VISIT (CHC)
__label__Other The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.
__label__Other He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.
__label__Other He has had an eventful past six months.
"__label__Other In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke."
__label__Other He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.
__label__Other His symptomatology fortunately clear.
__label__Other His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.
"__label__Other About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe."
__label__Other He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.
"__label__Other Not long after this, he went into renal failure."
__label__Other He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.
"__label__Other According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9."
"__label__Other Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4."
__label__Other His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.
__label__Other He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.
"__label__Other He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement."
"__label__Other They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation."
"__label__Other On examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses."
__label__Other I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.
"__label__Other Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable."
__label__Other He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.
__label__Other He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.
__label__Other There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.
__label__Other This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.
__label__Other There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.
__label__Other We will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d.
__label__Other for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.
__label__Other I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.
__label__Other I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.
"__label__Other Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration."
__label__Other His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.
__label__Other I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.

__label__Other Impression:  
__label__Other Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.
__label__Other His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.
__label__Other His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.
__label__Other He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.
"__label__Other Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez."
"__label__Other Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal."
__label__Other Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
__label__Other He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.
__label__Other His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.
__label__Other He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.
"__label__cad.symptom.during_dct Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation."
__label__Other His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.

__label__Other he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.
__label__Other Since that
"__label__Other surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time"

"__label__Other The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he"
"__label__Other did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician"
"__label__Other did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully."
"__label__Other At the current time,"
__label__Other Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is
"__label__Other able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several"
__label__Other months ago.
"__label__Other In fact, he was told recently that he does not need"

__label__Other He has no known drug allergies.
__label__Other He discontinued cigarette
__label__Other smoking years ago.
"__label__Other On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60."
__label__Other His pulse was
"__label__Other 56, afebrile."
"__label__Other O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when"
"__label__Other I rechecked it, it was 95%."
__label__Other His weight was 221 lbs.
__label__Other He is in no
__label__Other respiratory distress at rest.
__label__Other His oropharynx had dry mucosa and
__label__Other a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.
__label__Other His neck had no
__label__Other enlarged lymph nodes.
__label__Other Chest had diminished breath sounds in the
__label__Other left base with crackles.
__label__Other His right lung was clear.
__label__Other His heart
__label__Other was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic
__label__Other murmur.
"__label__Other His abdomen was protuberant, but benign."
__label__Other His

__label__Other Pulmonary
__label__Other function testing had been performed in December and was repeated
"__label__Other again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined"
__label__Other restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.
__label__Other His current
__label__Other vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of
__label__Other December.
__label__Other He has no bronchodilator response.
__label__Other I took Mr. Joshi
__label__Other for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that
__label__Other includes after walking up one flight of stairs.
"__label__Other In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely"
__label__Other mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning.
"__label__Other However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on"
"__label__Other my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred"
__label__Other him to have a decubitus chest film taken.
__label__Other Mr. Joshi had several
__label__Other questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have
__label__Other recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.
__label__Other I do
__label__Other not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled
__label__Other corticosteroid for this gentleman.
__label__Other I do recommend that he get
__label__Other daily exercise.
__label__Other He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and
__label__Other I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that
__label__Other he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.
__label__Other I have also
__label__Other confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen.
__label__Other His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced
"__label__Other defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for"
__label__Other albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely
__label__Other to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

"__label__Other Dear Dr. Null, "
__label__cad.event.before_dct I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result."
__label__cad.mention.during_dct No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.
"__label__Other Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident."
"__label__cad.symptom.before_dct He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk."
"__label__cad.mention.during_dct He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden."
"__label__Other Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints."
__label__Other He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.
"__label__Other He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema."
"__label__Other He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication."
"__label__Other He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight."
"__label__Other He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well."
"__label__Other He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home."
"__label__Other He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI."
"__label__Other Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed."
"__label__Other His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor."
"__label__Other Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis."
__label__Other His past medical history includes:
"__label__cad.event.before_dct   CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA"
__label__Other   VF arrest in setting of STEMI
"__label__Other   Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT"
__label__Other   LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct   hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
__label__Other   hypothyroid
__label__Other   basal cell skin CA
__label__Other   nephrolithiasis
__label__Other His medications include:
__label__medication.statin..before_dct   Lipitor 80 mg
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct   Plavix 150 mg
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct   ASA 325 mg po QD
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct   Toprol 200 mg po BID
__label__Other   Levoxyl
__label__Other   Omega-3-fatty acids
__label__Other   Multivitamin
__label__Other He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD."
"__label__Other He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job."
"__label__Other He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week."
"__label__Other He is married, and lives in Lincoln City."
"__label__Other He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets."
__label__smoker.never He has never smoked cigarettes.
__label__Other He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.
"__label__Other On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#."
__label__Other He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.
__label__Other His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.
__label__Other His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
"__label__Other He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups."
__label__Other His abdomen is benign.
"__label__Other He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally."
"__label__Other His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether."
"__label__Other His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records."
"__label__Other His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past."
"__label__Other I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal."
"__label__Other As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future."
"__label__Other We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms."
__label__Other It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.
"__label__Other I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns."
"__label__Other Regards,"

__label__Other MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  
"__label__Other CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP."
__label__Other His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation.
"__label__Other His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke."
"__label__Other The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification."
"__label__Other Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis."
"__label__Other Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely."
"__label__Other Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP."
"__label__Other The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary."

__label__Other Re:  Brady Duvall
__label__Other      MR #425-03-15-1
__label__Other Dear Patricia:
__label__Other I saw Brady Duvall again today.
__label__Other He has been very stable
__label__Other clinically over these past six months.
__label__Other I believe this represents
__label__Other a composite of the following three major changes in his medical
__label__Other regimen.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,"
__label__Other and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.
__label__Other He
"__label__Other had biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to"
__label__Other his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose
__label__Other of Lasix.
__label__Other He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.
"__label__Other does have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is"
__label__Other quite reasonable.
__label__Other He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Lasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril"
__label__Other 6.25 mg p.o.
"__label__medication.insulin..before_dct t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and"
__label__Other mexiletine.
__label__Other His amiodarone has been discontinued.
__label__Other He does have
"__label__Other asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,"
__label__Other but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the
__label__Other present time.
__label__Other He has not been shocked by his ICD.
__label__Other Functionally he seems quite stable.
"__label__Other He does have mild fatigue,"
__label__Other but is otherwise reasonably active.
__label__Other He will hopefully be
__label__Other traveling to Miami this spring.
__label__Other Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs.
"__label__Other His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69."
__label__Other His neck
"__label__Other veins are in fact, quite unimpressive."
__label__Other There is minimal jugular
"__label__Other distention, perhaps 6-7 cm."
__label__Other There is no hepatojugular reflux.
__label__Other      MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98
__label__Other Lungs were clear.
__label__Other Examination of his heart reveals a quiet
__label__Other precordium.
__label__Other S1 and S2 seem normal.
"__label__Other No S3, no gallop and no"
__label__Other murmur or mitral regurgitation.
__label__Other Abdomen is benign without
__label__Other palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema.
__label__Other There are bilateral varicosities.
__label__Other His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.
__label__Other Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen.
"__label__Other Accordingly, I have made no changes."
__label__Other I have checked appropriate
__label__Other electrolytes.
__label__Other Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.
__label__Other With best regards.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other Dear Dr. Irvine:
"__label__Other I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her "
__label__Other primary care physician.
"__label__Other As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female "
__label__Other who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you 
__label__Other have been taking care of her.
__label__Other I have not seen her now for the past ten 
__label__Other months.
"__label__Other For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history "
__label__Other briefly.
__label__Other It includes a history of atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other She is status 
__label__Other post an MVR with Duluth Clinic.
__label__Other She is on chronic anti-coagulation.
__label__Other She is 
__label__Other status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
__label__Other strep glomerular nephritis.
__label__Other She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
__label__Other several decades with no history of rejection.
__label__Other She also has a history of 
__label__cad.event.before_dct a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement.
"__label__Other As well, she has a "
"__label__Other history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated "
__label__Other intermittently with epidural steroid injection.
"__label__Other About a year ago, she "
__label__Other had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
__label__Other some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
__label__Other fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
__label__Other nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
__label__Other fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home.
__label__Other I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
"__label__Other where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully "
__label__Other treated with levofloxacin.
__label__Other MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
"__label__Other include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, "
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, "
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg "
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on "
__label__Other her INR.
__label__Other ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
__label__Other cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
__label__Other which seems to have been stopped.
"__label__Other As well, she is on sliding scale "
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently."
__label__Other Page 2
"__label__Other The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were "
__label__Other concerned that she was not getting optimal care.
"__label__Other In talking to her, she "
__label__Other says she feels quite well.
__label__Other She has no pain.
__label__Other She has no pain in her 
__label__Other buttocks or her legs.
__label__Other She says her breathing feels well.
__label__Other She has no 
__label__Other productive cough.
__label__Other She has no chest pain.
__label__Other She denies any peripheral 
__label__Other edema.
__label__Other She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
"__label__Other exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she "
__label__Other is getting reasonable care.
"__label__Other However, she does breakdown and cry about "
__label__Other her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
__label__Other home.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70."
__label__Other She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72.
__label__Other She 
__label__Other has sharp clicks over her chest.
__label__Other She has a soft abdomen with no 
__label__Other organomegaly and a well healed scar.
__label__Other She has equal pulses bilaterally.
__label__Other She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags.
__label__Other She has a full 
"__label__Other range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and "
__label__Other ankles.
__label__Other She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
__label__Other she seems relatively stable.
__label__Other She is somewhat confused about the date and 
"__label__Other the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly "
__label__Other about her current situation at Elm Hills.
__label__Other I have no laboratory data to speak of.
__label__Other I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
__label__Other and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
__label__Other and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
__label__Other unsupervised setting.
__label__Other I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
__label__Other place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
__label__Other antidepressant.
__label__Other It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
"__label__Other recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of "
"__label__Other SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects."
"__label__Other I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, "
__label__Other but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
__label__Other me with questions about her past history.
"__label__Other Sincerely, "

__label__Other 	Assessment and plan:
__label__Other    Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation.
"__label__Other We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation."
__label__Other We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease.
__label__Other We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily.
__label__Other If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation.
__label__Other We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management.
__label__Other He has a CHAD2 Score of 0.
__label__Other We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time.
"__label__Other We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed."
"__label__Other We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status."
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

"__label__Other Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital"
__label__Other CC:  chest pain
__label__Other HPI:
"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147."
"__label__Other He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery."
"__label__Other The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue."
"__label__Other On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal."
__label__Other Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.
__label__Other A subsequent exercise echo was normal.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.
__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.
"__label__Other Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening."
"__label__Other These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout."
"__label__Other The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout."
__label__Other His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.
"__label__Other Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes."
"__label__Other The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home."
"__label__Other Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months."
"__label__Other The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats."
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved."
__label__Other EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.
__label__Other Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.
__label__Other A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.

__label__Other Choelithiasis without cholecystitis.
"__label__Other Punctate calcification in the left kidney, without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis, likely vascular, though renal calculus is possible."
__label__Other Assessment:
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety."
"__label__Other The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE."
"__label__Other The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity."
"__label__Other In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur."
__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.
"__label__Other Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors."
__label__cad.event.before_dct This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.

__label__Other Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms."
"__label__Other He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time."
__label__Other The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin.
"__label__Other Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week."
"__label__Other He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema."
__label__Other He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital.
__label__Other He does not know the details of the workup.
"__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65."
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose.
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro."
__label__Other HR was 85 and BP 135/82.
__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct He was given ASA and a BB.
"__label__Other Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6."
"__label__Other Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6."
__label__Other There were no old EKGs available for comparison.
__label__Other He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44).
__label__Other A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE.
__label__Other (the ddimer was elevated).
__label__Other His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation.
"__label__Other On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free."
"__label__Other Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema."
__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct ASA and BB were cont.
__label__Other The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test.
"__label__Other However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead."
__label__Other This is planned for this morning.
__label__Other Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

__label__Other 12/10/94 Intern addendum:
__label__Other Patient seen and examined with med student above.
__label__Other Agree with overall assessment above.
__label__Other Briefly:
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days."
"__label__Other DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine."
"__label__Other Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities."
"__label__Other Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins."
"__label__Other Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE."
"__label__Other CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this."
"__label__Other Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy."
"__label__Other Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress."
__label__Other D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

"__label__Other      pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,"
__label__Other      oropharynx without erythema.
__label__Other JVP 4 cm supine.
__label__Other There was no
"__label__Other      lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly."
"__label__Other Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2."
__label__Other There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
__label__Other Chest:
__label__Other      Clear to auscultation.
__label__Other Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
__label__Other      lower quadrant without external drainage.
__label__Other The abdomen was soft with mild
__label__Other      tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
__label__Other      guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.
__label__Other Extremities reveal no
__label__Other      edema.
__label__Other There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
__label__Other      on the left side of her foot.
__label__Other Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
__label__Other Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
__label__Other      lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
"__label__Other      in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior"
__label__Other      tibialis.
"__label__Other LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets"
"__label__Other      443,000."
"__label__Other INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were"
__label__Other      negative x3.
__label__Other EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
__label__Other Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.
__label__Other Her
__label__Other      adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
__label__Other      perfusion defects.
__label__Other She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
"__label__Other      heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%."
__label__Other CT of chest with a PE
__label__Other      protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
__label__Other HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
__label__Other      of general surgery.
__label__Other The patient had expressed an interest in considering
__label__Other      colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
"__label__Other Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during"
__label__Other      surgery.
__label__Other After extensive
"__label__Other      conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,"
__label__Other      I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
"__label__Other      perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may"
__label__Other      have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
__label__Other      to pursue this.
__label__Other Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
__label__Other Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.
__label__Other She will
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct      continue to be treated with antihypertensives.
__label__Other Her chest wall pain is
__label__Other      likely due to esophageal spasm.
__label__Other Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
__label__Other Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
__label__Other      fibromyalgia.
__label__Other This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
__label__Other      extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications.
"__label__Other At the time, we"
__label__Other      will continue pain medications for her comfort.
__label__Other Continue aggressive bowel
__label__Other      regimen.
__label__Other Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
__label__Other      eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.
__label__Other The family currently
__label__Other      working to try to obtain dentures for her.
"__label__Other Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive"
"__label__Other      conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic"
__label__Other      intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.
__label__Other DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o.
"__label__Other daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o."

__label__Other He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
__label__Other He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.
"__label__cad.symptom.during_dct He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest."
__label__Other He has not had any rest pain.
"__label__Other For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta."
__label__Other He then had a left brachial artery.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.
"__label__Other There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear."
"__label__Other With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation."
"__label__smoker.past He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol."
__label__Other He is married and lives in Missouri.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day."

__label__Other IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.
__label__Other We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.
__label__Other We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.
__label__Other We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

__label__Other Neurology Clinic Follow-up
__label__Other ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections
__label__Other HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.
"__label__Other Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion."
__label__Other The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.
__label__Other Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.
"__label__Other Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service."
__label__Other He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.
__label__Other His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.
__label__Other A hypercoagulability panel was negative.
__label__Other Homocysteine was normal.
__label__Other Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.
__label__Other The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.
__label__Other The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.
"__label__Other He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting."
__label__Other His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.
__label__Other Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.
"__label__Other The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site."
__label__Other This may represent abscess.
"__label__Other Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture."
__label__Other Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.
__label__Other Patient denies fever or chills.
__label__Other He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.
__label__Other This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.
"__label__Other Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well."
__label__Other He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.
"__label__Other His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone."

__label__Other Re:  Christine Olivier
__label__Other      MR #652-33-21-5
__label__Other Dear Dr. Arteaga:
__label__Other Mrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.
"__label__Other Since last seen, she reports"
"__label__Other return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,"
__label__Other occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.
"__label__Other Of note, she underwent"
__label__Other a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar
"__label__Other syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left"
__label__Other back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60."
__label__Other A
__label__Other simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left
"__label__cad.event.before_dct ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction"
__label__Other involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal
__label__Other peri-infarct ischemia.
"__label__Other In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound"
__label__Other study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right
__label__Other peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,"
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,"
"__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40"
"__label__Other mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and"
"__label__medication.insulin..during_dct Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and"

__label__Other Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.
__label__Other Blood
"__label__Other pressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,"
"__label__Other respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four"
__label__Other pounds below her weight of six months ago.
__label__Other The neck is supple with
__label__Other JVP flat.
__label__Other Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.
__label__Other Chest is
__label__Other clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and"
__label__Other a I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.
__label__Other No significant diastolic murmur or rub.
__label__Other The abdomen is benign.
__label__Other Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema.
__label__Other Peripheral pulses are diminished.
"__label__Other Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval"
"__label__Other of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25."
__label__Other There is borderline
__label__Other Page Two
__label__Other evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
__label__Other wave changes.
"__label__Other Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has"
__label__Other been no significant change.
"__label__Other Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left"
__label__Other shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct surgery angina.
"__label__Other In this setting, a dobutamine stress test"
__label__Other performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.
__label__Other I
__label__Other have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
__label__Other therapeutic and diagnostic options.
__label__Other She made it quite clear that
"__label__Other she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,"
"__label__Other and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility"
__label__Other (should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
__label__Other vascularization.
__label__Other It is not entirely clear to me that her left
"__label__Other shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly"
__label__Other understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities.
__label__Other I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.
__label__Other In the
"__label__Other meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort"
__label__Other syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
__label__Other morning.
__label__Other She will call me within the next several days to report
__label__Other how this helps her discomfort syndrome.
__label__Other I do not believe that she
__label__Other is having GERD to explain her symptoms.
__label__Other In light of her reluctance
"__label__Other to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to"
__label__Other tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
__label__Other discomfort syndrome.
"__label__Other I, of course, will keep you fully informed as"
"__label__Other to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her"
__label__Other care.

__label__cad.event.before_dct He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.
__label__Other He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.
__label__Other He has had some episodic nature to this.
"__label__Other Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool."
__label__Other This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.
__label__Other He had no palpitations at that time.
__label__Other He has no chest discomfort.
__label__Other His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct He has diabetes.
__label__Other He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.
"__label__medication.diuretic..during_dct His current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness."
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.
__label__medication.diuretic..after_dct He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.
__label__Other He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct He is on insulin and Lantus.
__label__Other He has no known drug allergies.
__label__Other His family history is essentially unremarkable.
"__label__Other Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s."
__label__Other The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.
__label__smoker.past He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.
__label__Other He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.
"__label__Other Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits."
__label__Other He has no problems with swallowing.
__label__Other He has no problems with hearing or vision.
__label__Other Review of systems is otherwise negative.
"__label__Other On physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm."
__label__Other His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.
__label__Other Temperature is 35.9.
__label__Other His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.
"__label__Other His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible."
__label__Other He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.
__label__Other The right ventricular impulse is present also.
"__label__Other He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize."
__label__Other It does not change with respiration.
__label__Other The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.
__label__Other His legs are cool.
__label__Other Venous pattern is very prominent.
__label__Other His pulses are intact peripherally.
__label__Other He has no abdominal bruits.
__label__Other His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.
__label__Other He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.
__label__Other His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.
__label__Other He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.
"__label__Other Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention."
__label__Other There is no peripheral edema.
"__label__Other His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back."
"__label__Other He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses."
__label__Other His standing blood pressure is unchanged.
__label__Other He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.
__label__Other We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.
__label__Other The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.
__label__Other He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.
"__label__Other However, the episodicity is significant."
__label__Other 2.
"__label__Other Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern."
__label__Other His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.
"__label__Other However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected."
__label__Other It is also possible that this is related to angina.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Other related risks.
__label__Other He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.
"__label__Other It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function."
__label__Other There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.
"__label__Other At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation."
"__label__Other Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion."
__label__Other We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

__label__Other Dear Ken:
__label__cad.event.before_dct Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal."
__label__Other He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.
__label__Other His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.
"__label__Other He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge."
__label__Other He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.
"__label__Other Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias."
__label__Other He is slowly recovering his overall strength.
"__label__Other The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3."
__label__Other On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o."
"__label__Other q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o."
"__label__Other q.d., p.r.n."
__label__Other Tylenol No.
"__label__Other 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o."
"__label__Other q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o."
"__label__Other q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.statin..after_dct b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o."
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.
"__label__Other Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds."
"__label__Other The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits."
__label__Other Chest is clear.
"__label__Other Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub."
__label__Other The abdomen is benign.
__label__Other Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.
"__label__Other Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees."
__label__Other There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.
__label__Other An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.
__label__Other No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.
__label__cad.event.before_dct Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.
__label__Other I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.
"__label__Other I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued."
"__label__Other At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin."
"__label__Other In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention."
"__label__Other In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center."
__label__cad.mention.before_dct I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.
__label__Other He will have routine blood studies obtained today.
__label__Other I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.
"__label__Other Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen."
__label__Other Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.
"__label__Other Sincerely yours,"

__label__Other Name:  Mr. Danny Nielson
__label__Other MR #:  9156593
__label__Other Date of admission: 08/28/2097
"__label__Other Admitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD	"
__label__Other PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel
"__label__Other Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note"
__label__Other Code: Full
__label__Other CC:     Want to get my chemo   
__label__Other ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.
__label__Other HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.
__label__Other He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.
"__label__Other He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta."
__label__Other He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.
"__label__Other Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation."
"__label__Other The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness."
"__label__Other PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion."
__label__Other It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.
__label__Other The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.
__label__Other PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.
"__label__Other The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass."
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen."
"__label__Other Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first."
__label__Other Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.
__label__Other He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.
__label__Other Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.
__label__Other He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.
"__label__Other On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia."
__label__Other He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.
__label__Other He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.
"__label__Other He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena."
"__label__Other Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation."

__label__Other Re:  Dalila Haynes
__label__Other        783-61-34-3
__label__Other Dear Dr. Kay: 
__label__Other I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.
__label__Other She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.
__label__Other I will review her history for the record.
"__label__Other She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss."
__label__Other Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.
"__label__Other Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated."
__label__Other This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.
__label__Other During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.
__label__Other (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)
__label__Other An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.
__label__Other There was no abnormal enhancement.
__label__Other This was consistent with small vessel stroke.
__label__Other EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.
"__label__Other An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC."
__label__Other CSF ACE was normal.
__label__Other Cultures were negative.
__label__Other CSF VDRL was negative.
"__label__Other Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis."
__label__Other She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.
"__label__Other Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal."
__label__Other She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.

__label__Other Plantar responses are flexor.
__label__Other Coordination is intact.
__label__Other Romberg is negative.
__label__Other Gait and station are normal.
__label__Other Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.
"__label__Other Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis."
"__label__Other I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando."
__label__Other She had CSF pleocytosis in July.
"__label__Other With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis."
__label__Other I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.
"__label__Other Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis."
"__label__Other If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies."
"__label__Other Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus."
__label__Other These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.
"__label__Other She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this."
__label__Other I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.
__label__Other She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
"__label__Other I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course."
__label__Other Thank you for this consultation.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

"__label__Other Fellow: Inge Logan, MD"
"__label__Other Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD"
"__label__Other Date of visit:  March 27, 2062"
__label__Other Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.
__label__Other Hematologic History:
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.
"__label__Other At the time, blood sugar was >500."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care."
"__label__Other At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA."
"__label__Other Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well."
__label__Other LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
__label__Other He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.
__label__Other Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
__label__Other He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
__label__Other Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.
__label__Other The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
__label__Other He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
"__label__Other Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated."
__label__Other Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
__label__Other Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
__label__Other Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).
__label__Other He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
__label__Other But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
__label__Other A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.
"__label__Other His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process."
"__label__Other As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter."
"__label__Other Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital."
"__label__Other As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication."
"__label__Other As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
__label__Other He was discharged from the hospital in September.
__label__Other Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.
"__label__Other Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid."
__label__Other His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%).
__label__Other He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.
"__label__Other His platelets were 502,000."
__label__Other An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.
"__label__Other He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000."
__label__Other His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid.
__label__Other Interval History:
"__label__Other Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month."
"__label__Other When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0."
__label__Other A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.
__label__Other He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.
"__label__Other In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months."
"__label__Other He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss."
__label__Other He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.
"__label__Other He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms."

__label__Other It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.
__label__Other We are following his CBC on hydrea.
__label__Other His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).
__label__Other He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.
__label__Other His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.
"__label__Other We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely."
"__label__Other At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia."
__label__Other We would advise continuing current hydrea.
__label__Other Continue current hydrea
__label__Other Monitor counts monthly
__label__Other Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine.
__label__Other Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts
__label__Other The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.

__label__Other MAH CANCER CENTER
__label__Other NAME:  Danny Nielson 
__label__Other MAH#:  915-65-93
"__label__Other DATE OF VISIT:  November 10, 2097"
__label__Other REASON FOR VISIT:  
__label__Other Mr. Nielson is a 77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin s lymphoma who is status post four cycles of CHOP-R chemotherapy with persistent disease (documented by PET and biopsy).
__label__Other He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.
"__label__Other As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday."
__label__Other He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.
__label__Other INTERVAL HISTORY:
__label__Other He describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.
"__label__Other He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then."
"__label__Other However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure."
"__label__Other In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid."
__label__Other This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.
__label__Other Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.
"__label__Other In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so  he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week."
__label__Other MEDICATIONS:  
__label__medication.sulfonylureas..before_dct glyburide 10 mg 
__label__medication.statin..after_dct atorvastatin 10 mg daily
__label__Other furosemide 40 mg daily
__label__Other multiple vitamin daily
__label__Other prednisone 5 mg daily
__label__Other Tylenol p.r.n.
"__label__Other Bactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday"
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
"__label__Other Weight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130/80, and respiratory rate is 20."
__label__Other Pain index is 0/10.
__label__Other Fatigue index is 5/10.
__label__Other Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats.
__label__Other Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.
__label__Other LABORATORY STUDIES:  
"__label__Other White blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45."
"__label__Other Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208."
__label__Other ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  
"__label__Other Given his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure  We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms."
__label__Other I suspect he will be admitted.
"__label__Other Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control."
"__label__Other Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy."
"__label__Other As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset."

__label__Other MR: 89276954
__label__Other Dear Usha:
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms."
"__label__Other Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status"
__label__cad.event.before_dct post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.
__label__Other As you
"__label__Other know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior"
__label__Other wall ischemia.
__label__Other I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not"
__label__Other have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.
"__label__Other Therefore,"
__label__Other I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
__label__Other probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
__label__Other bypass this area.
__label__Other She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
"__label__Other venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal."
__label__Other She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
__label__Other recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.
"__label__Other However,"
__label__Other she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
__label__Other history of otitis media in her right ear.
"__label__Other Therefore, I think it"
__label__Other wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
__label__Other her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.
__label__Other In the
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and"
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
__label__Other these episodes.
__label__Other I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
__label__Other these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
__label__Other with her cardiovascular system.
__label__Other She will return to see me in
"__label__Other follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her"
__label__Other cholesterol level.
"__label__Other Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your"
__label__Other patient.
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
__label__Other questions.
"__label__Other With warm regards,"

__label__Other Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.
__label__Other He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.
"__label__Other He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever."
__label__Other He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.
"__label__Other On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well."
__label__Other HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.
"__label__Other No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86."
"__label__Other S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop."
"__label__Other His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute."
"__label__Other His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds."
__label__Other Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.
__label__Other He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.
__label__Other He does not have any egophony.
"__label__Other His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing."
__label__Other The surgical wound is well-healed.
__label__Other There is no evidence of local recurrence.
__label__Other The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging.
__label__Other The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.
"__label__Other In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease."
__label__Other I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

__label__Other RE:  Urania Yerger
__label__Other      MR #583-48-90-0
__label__Other Dear Dr. Dillon:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first
__label__Other time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her
__label__cad.mention.before_dct coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in
__label__Other October of this year.
"__label__Other Though you know her history well, I will"
__label__Other recount it for the purposes of record keeping.
__label__Other Ms. Yerger is
__label__Other presently 81 years old.
__label__Other Her vascular risk factors include
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia."
__label__Other She had no prior diagnosis
__label__Other of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash
__label__Other pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST
__label__Other elevation myocardial infarction.
__label__Other Coronary angiography at the
"__label__Other Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,"
__label__Other thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent
__label__Other complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal
__label__Other as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.
__label__Other Angiography also
__label__Other revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.
__label__Other The patient underwent
__label__cad.event.before_dct subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed
__label__cad.event.before_dct by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.
__label__Other (SVG to
"__label__Other ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD)."
__label__Other Ms. Yerger's postoperative
__label__Other course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient
__label__Other episode of atrial fibrillation.
"__label__Other Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of"
__label__Other activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending
__label__Other shopping trips.
"__label__Other Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve."
"__label__Other She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest."
__label__Other She has
__label__Other had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein
__label__Other graft harvesting.
"__label__Other She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA"
__label__Other symptoms or claudication.
__label__Other Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.
__label__Other Ms.
__label__Other Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on
__label__Other her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a
__label__Other possible viral exanthem.
"__label__Other Yerger, Urania"
"__label__Other MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078"
__label__Other Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency
"__label__Other (baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and"
__label__Other prior right knee replacement.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.
"__label__medication.sulfonylureas..before_dct day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril"
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct 5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q."
"__label__medication.thiazolidinedione..during_dct day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream."
__label__Other Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family
__label__Other members in the area.
__label__Other She is currently staying with her daughter.
"__label__Other At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but"
__label__Other is limited by chronic knee pain.
__label__smoker.never She denies alcohol or tobacco
__label__Other use.
__label__Other Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.
"__label__Other On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today."
__label__Other She is
__label__Other comfortable seated on the exam table.
__label__Other Her skin is warm and dry.
__label__Other She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly
__label__Other on her extremities.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate"
__label__Other is in the 70's.
__label__Other She has no jugular venous distention.
__label__Other Her
__label__Other carotids are 2+ without bruits.
__label__Other Her chest reveals decreased breath
__label__Other sounds at the left base.
__label__Other There are no crackles or wheezes.
__label__Other Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and
"__label__Other rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased."
__label__Other There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the
__label__Other apex.
__label__Other Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
__label__Other Her extremities are free
__label__Other of cyanosis or clubbing.
__label__Other Distal pulses are 1+.
__label__Other She has mild edema
__label__Other of the left lower extremity.
"__label__Other Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and"
"__label__Other intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions."
"__label__Other Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after"
__label__cad.event.before_dct her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid
__label__Other October.
__label__Other Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to
__label__Other persistent pleural effusion.
__label__Other We will reevaluate today with a
__label__Other repeat chest x-ray.
"__label__Other In the meantime, I think that we should"
__label__Other continue her oral diuretic regimen.
__label__Other It is possible that her
__label__Other persistent rash is related to her Lasix.
__label__Other Although not certain to
"__label__Other be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today"
__label__Other in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may
__label__Other resolve.
__label__Other I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.
__label__Other We
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for"
__label__Other secondary prevention.
__label__Other I look forward to seeing her again in
__label__Other approximately eight to twelve weeks.
"__label__Other In addition, she will follow-"
__label__Other up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a
__label__Other persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her
__label__Other symptoms.
"__label__Other MR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078"
__label__Other It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.
__label__Other Please do
__label__Other not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

"__label__Other Dear Vicente, "
"__label__Other Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions."
"__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year."
__label__Other He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer.
"__label__Other In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home."
__label__Other He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses.
"__label__Other He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep."
"__label__Other He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties."
__label__Other He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.
"__label__Other Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas."
"__label__Other In addition, loud snoring was noted."
__label__Other There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes.
"__label__Other There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep."
"__label__Other There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study."
__label__Other In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.
"__label__Other The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm."
"__label__Other Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes)."
"__label__Other There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep""."
"__label__Other Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows""."
"__label__Other The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general."
"__label__Other As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house."
"__label__Other Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology)."
"__label__Other The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day""."
"__label__Other If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m."
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis."

__label__Other ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.
__label__smoker.never SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage.
__label__Other He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years.
__label__Other His current weight is 195 pounds.
"__label__Other He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16."
"__label__Other HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted."
"__label__Other The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact."
__label__Other He is presently wearing dental braces.
__label__Other No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.
"__label__Other No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted."
__label__Other No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence.
"__label__Other The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias."
__label__Other No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.
"__label__Other No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  
"__label__Other Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep."
"__label__Other These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage)."
"__label__Other Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea."
"__label__Other The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm)."
"__label__Other In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success."
"__label__Other One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above."
"__label__Other Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem."
"__label__Other While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e."
__label__Other in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.
__label__Other PLAN:  
"__label__Other In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o."
__label__Other q. h.s.
__label__Other PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.
"__label__Other The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency."
"__label__Other The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations."
"__label__Other Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms)."
"__label__Other If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well."
"__label__Other In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim."
"__label__Other The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time)."
"__label__Other Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez."

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ickes comes in with pain in his right 
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct hip, left shoulder and for follow up of his coronary artery disease and "
__label__Other his left wrist.
__label__Other His right hip continues to be painful at times.
__label__Other A radiogram in December 
__label__Other showed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.
__label__Other He has been taking 
__label__Other Motrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.
__label__Other His left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually 
__label__Other is somewhat better than it has been.
__label__Other It hurts to abduct him more than 
__label__Other 90 degrees or to reach behind his back.
__label__Other His left wrist is bothering him some now.
__label__Other It is sore with most types of 
__label__Other motion.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this "
__label__Other morning.
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct Regarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning."
__label__Other He 
__label__Other has had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, "
__label__Other pulse is 70 and regular.
__label__Other He is a pleasant black man in no apparent 
__label__Other distress.
__label__Other Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
__label__Other Chest 
__label__Other is clear to auscultation and percussion.

__label__Other Abdomen is soft.
"__label__Other Extremities, "
__label__Other without edema.
"__label__Other Right hip, no pain with leg rolling."
__label__Other Left shoulder is 
__label__Other able to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to 
__label__Other abduct completely with only minimal discomfort.
__label__Other It is nontender to 
__label__Other palpation.
"__label__Other Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint "
__label__Other line.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Right hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him 
__label__Other to continue on the Motrin as needed.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Left shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.
__label__Other He feels this has 
__label__Other improved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different 
__label__Other for now but will let me know if it causes more problems.

__label__Other Left wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.
__label__Other He is tender in the joint line today.
__label__Other It is bothering him a little 
__label__Other bit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Umali:
__label__smoker.unknown Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.
"__label__Other Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years."
__label__Other He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.
__label__Other He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.
__label__Other Review of systems is negative except as above.
__label__Other Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.
"__label__Other Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day."
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress."
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct BP 169/83 and pulse 58.
__label__Other Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.
__label__Other Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
"__label__Other Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops."
"__label__Other Extremities:  No edema, warm."
__label__Other Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.
__label__Other Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.
__label__Other Skeletal films are pending.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD."
__label__Other Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..
__label__Other He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.
"__label__Other I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS."
"__label__Other I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable."
"__label__Other However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy."
"__label__medication.arb..after_dct In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen."
__label__Other He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.
__label__Other Thank you for referring this patient.

__label__Other To Dr. Estep:
__label__Other I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.
__label__Other Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.
"__label__Other Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities."
__label__Other We understand that she has also had previous strokes.
"__label__Other In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct."
__label__Other She recalls having only V2 clinical events.
"__label__Other She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%."
__label__Other She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.
__label__Other This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.
"__label__Other There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure."
__label__Other She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.
"__label__Other She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema."
__label__Other She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.
__label__Other She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.
"__label__Other Moreover, she does not have claudication."
__label__Other Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.
__label__Other She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

__label__Other There are no carotid bruits.
__label__Other She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.
__label__Other Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.
__label__Other Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.
__label__Other Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.
__label__Other Her apex beat is within normal limits.
__label__Other Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.
__label__Other Her abdomen is soft and nontender.
__label__Other There are no obvious masses.
__label__Other Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.
"__label__Other Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally."
__label__Other They are symmetrical.
"__label__Other Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated."
__label__Other A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.
__label__Other Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.
__label__Other We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.
__label__Other (It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).
"__label__Other Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it."
"__label__Other If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those."
__label__Other Her hypertension is controlled today.
__label__Other Her dyslipidemia is not bad.
"__label__Other However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o."
"__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5."
__label__Other It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.
__label__Other She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.
__label__Other We recommend.
__label__Other We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
__label__Other We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
__label__Other daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o.
__label__Other We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
__label__Other We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.
"__label__Other We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady."

__label__Other CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
__label__Other hives after taking Keflex.
__label__smoker.unknown HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
__label__Other chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
__label__Other axilla and her groin.
__label__Other She has been to the emergency room
__label__Other multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.
__label__Other She has
__label__Other been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
__label__Other dicloxacillin.
__label__Other She is planning to have her disease surgically
__label__Other managed in the next few months.
__label__Other She most recently presented to
"__label__Other the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage"
__label__Other of her hydradenitis in her groin.
__label__Other She was given a prescription
__label__Other of Keflex.
"__label__Other Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed"
"__label__Other itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives."
__label__Other She
"__label__Other denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of"
__label__Other consciousness.
__label__Other She called the emergency room and was instructed
__label__Other to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
__label__Other reaction.
"__label__Other So now, she is here for follow up from that."
__label__Other She said
__label__Other shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
__label__Other itchiness have improved very quickly.
__label__Other She is still complaining
__label__Other of purulent drainage around her groin.
__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.
"__label__medication.sulfonylureas..during_dct MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain."
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.
__label__Other gets hives from both.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.
__label__Other Her bilateral
"__label__Other groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some"
__label__Other purulent drainage.
__label__Other There is no fluctuance that I could feel.
__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.
__label__Other Given the
"__label__Other recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a"
__label__Other different antibiotic.
__label__Other She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
__label__Other with good result.
__label__Other Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
"__label__Other compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for"
__label__Other now.
"__label__Other If this does not work, I think one should consider"
__label__Other clindamycin for treatment.
__label__Other I will go ahead and give her 14 days
__label__Other worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D.
__label__Other if
__label__Other she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.
__label__Other I also gave
__label__Other her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her

"__label__Other Dear Wilcox,"
__label__Other      I saw Mr. Robison today.
__label__Other I hadn't seen him since last year.
__label__Other I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.
"__label__Other He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth."
__label__Other His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).
"__label__Other He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet."
__label__Other There is no tremor.
__label__Other His arms and legs are strong.
__label__Other Extraocular movements are full.
__label__Other The pupils are equal.
__label__Other There is no ptosis.
__label__Other His speech is fluent.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).
__label__Other His blood pressure is 120/80.
__label__Other The pulse is around 76.
__label__Other There are no cervical bruits.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.
__label__Other I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery.
__label__Other The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.
__label__Other The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.
__label__Other It may well be occluded with collateralization.
__label__Other The left imaging was in 2082.
__label__Other He is stable at this time.
__label__Other He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.

__label__Other Impression:
__label__Other Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history.
"__label__Other Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital."
__label__Other Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history.
__label__Other This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.
__label__Other Recommendations:
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct -          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100"
__label__Other -          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively
__label__Other -          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID
__label__Other -          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery.
__label__Other Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive
__label__Other Thank you for this interesting consult.

"__label__Other Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis"
__label__Other HPI:
__label__Other 27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.
"__label__Other At the time, blood sugar was >500."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.before_dct Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's."
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care."
"__label__Other At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well."
__label__Other LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.
__label__Other He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.
__label__Other Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.
__label__Other He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.
"__label__Other Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo."
__label__Other The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.
__label__Other He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.
"__label__Other Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated."
__label__Other Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.
__label__Other Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.
__label__Other Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.
__label__Other He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.
__label__Other But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.
__label__Other A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.
"__label__Other As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter."
"__label__Other Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital."
"__label__Other As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication."
"__label__Other As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer."
__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.
__label__Other He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.
__label__Other His energy has been good.
__label__Other He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.
__label__Other No bleeding/bruising.

"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT."
__label__Other He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.
"__label__Other Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea."
__label__Other It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd."
"__label__Other If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay."
"__label__Other At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis."
"__label__Other If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time."
"__label__Other Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level."
"__label__Other In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week."

__label__Other RE: Michael Ogrady
__label__Other        MR #631-90-33-7
__label__Other Dear Dr. Patton:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 
__label__Other his coronary artery
"__label__Other disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer."
"__label__Other As you know, this is a "
__label__Other 63-year-old male with a
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, "
__label__Other peripheral vascular
"__label__smoker.ever disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly "
__label__Other diagnosed
__label__Other esophageal carcinoma.
"__label__Other He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda "
"__label__Other Landers, for the last nine"
__label__Other years.
__label__Other Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 
__label__Other artery disease which is
__label__Other documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.
__label__Other The 
__label__Other catheterization demonstrated
"__label__Other right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion "
__label__Other and a 30%
__label__Other marginal 1 lesion.
__label__Other There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 
__label__Other PDA and from the
"__label__Other septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA."
__label__Other procedure was
__label__Other performed through the right radial artery without complications.
__label__Other Patient 
__label__Other also has peripheral
__label__Other vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 
__label__Other vein bypass graft in
__label__Other 2088.
__label__Other He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 
__label__Other femoral to posterior
__label__Other tibial graft.
__label__Other He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.
__label__Other His activity level is 
__label__Other limited by his claudication.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 
__label__Other treatment.
__label__Other At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.
__label__Other He gets 
__label__Other chest pressure one to
__label__Other two times a month.
"__label__Other However, his activity is extremely limited."
__label__Other He reports 
__label__Other that he has had a
__label__Other positive stress test.
__label__Other Further information is not available.
__label__Other understands he has coronary
"__label__Other disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty."
__label__Other On 
__label__Other catheterization he had
__label__Other preserved ejection fraction of 62%.
__label__Other He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 
__label__Other after receiving
__label__Other chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.
__label__Other Patient states he will be 
__label__Other receiving a Hickman
__label__Other Michael Ogrady
__label__Other Page 2
"__label__Other March 3, 2093"
__label__Other catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 
__label__Other therapy.
"__label__obese.mention.during_dct On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds."
__label__Other His blood 
"__label__Other pressure is 100/72,"
__label__Other heart rate is 57 bpm.
__label__Other HEENT: oropharynx benign.
__label__Other Neck: carotids intact 
__label__Other bilaterally without

__label__Other Distal pulses are absent.
__label__Other Neuro: 
__label__Other intact.
__label__Other EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.
__label__Other IMI with age undetermined.
__label__Other Nonspecific STT
__label__Other wave abnormalities present.
__label__Other No previous EKG for comparison.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary "
__label__Other artery disease and
__label__Other peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.
__label__Other He 
__label__Other clearly has ischemia
__label__Other on a positive stress test.
__label__Other I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 
__label__Other check ischemic
__label__Other threshold.
__label__Other He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 
__label__Other event.
"__label__Other However, given"
"__label__Other his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with "
__label__Other surgery even
__label__Other understanding possible complications.
__label__Other Plan:
__label__Other 1.
__label__Other Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 
__label__Other control of
"__label__Other      blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on "
__label__Other dobutamine
__label__Other      echocardiography.
"__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael "

__label__Other Re:  Peter Joshi

__label__Other This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and

"__label__Other At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally "
__label__Other active because of the
__label__Other flooding.
__label__Other He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.
__label__Other He has had no exertional 
"__label__Other neck, chest, arm"
__label__Other or jaw pain.
__label__Other He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 
__label__Other activity and he does
__label__Other have mild lower extremity edema.
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, "
"__label__medication.statin..after_dct simvastatin, Norvasc,"
"__label__medication.insulin..before_dct Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin."
"__label__Other On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds."
__label__Other His blood pressure is 
__label__Other 124/60 right and left
__label__Other arm seated.
__label__Other His heart rate is 54 and regular.
__label__Other Respiratory rate is 10.
__label__Other There is a mild increase in
__label__Other jugular venous pressure.
__label__Other Carotids are without bruits.
__label__Other Lungs are actually 
__label__Other clear to auscultation
__label__Other throughout.
__label__Other Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 
__label__Other but no gallop is
__label__Other present.
"__label__Other His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits."
__label__Other Extremities are
__label__Other notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 
__label__Other posterior tibialis and mild
__label__Other pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.
__label__Other His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  
__label__Other No significant

"__label__Other In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the "
__label__Other present time.
__label__Other He reports
__label__Other that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.
__label__Other Before adjusting his

"__label__Other She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications."
"__label__Other This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia."
"__label__Other Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic."
"__label__Other In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA."
__label__Other Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.
"__label__Other Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances."
"__label__Other Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl."
"__label__Other Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium."
"__label__Other Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur."
__label__Other Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.
"__label__Other However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively."
__label__Other She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.
"__label__Other She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely."
"__label__Other Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family."
"__label__Other Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS."
"__label__Other However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's."
"__label__Other The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium."
"__label__Other Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED."
__label__Other There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.
__label__Other There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state
"__label__Other Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause."
__label__Other She had a recent stress test that was negative.
"__label__Other However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home."
"__label__Other However, this would not cause the delirium."
"__label__Other Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia."
__label__Other Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia."

__label__Other Impression
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W.
"__label__medication.insulin..during_dct She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother"" coverage"
__label__Other Recommendation
__label__Other My recommendations are:
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct 1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct 2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct 3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms."
"__label__Other Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,"
"__label__cad.event.before_dct hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery."
__label__Other As
"__label__Other you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night."
"__label__Other She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations"
__label__Other whenever she takes the quinine.
__label__Other She has not been taking this since
__label__Other the initial two doses.
__label__Other I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
__label__Other secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.
__label__Other I have told her to eat
__label__Other a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
__label__Other cramps in the evening.
"__label__Other In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus"
__label__Other bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.
__label__Other There is borderline first
__label__Other degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
__label__Other from previous tracing.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.
__label__Other She will see me in follow-up in

__label__Other He has already met several times 
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his

"__label__Other On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood "

__label__Other      they usually are about 110.
__label__Other It was 101 this morning before 
"__label__Other      breakfast, she says."
__label__Other She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
__label__Other      six times it has been below 50.
__label__Other She does say she eats three regular 
__label__Other      meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
__label__Other      breakfast she said no.
__label__Other She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
__label__Other I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.
__label__Other I expressed to her again how 
"__label__Other      important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets."
__label__Other She had been eating a lot of chocolate.
__label__Other She says she has gotten off 
__label__Other      of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
__label__Other      then.
__label__Other She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
__label__Other      help her with her diet.
"__label__Other If her diet does get better, maybe we can "
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct      wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.
"__label__Other I explained to her, too, "
__label__Other      that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      be able to get her off the insulin.
__label__Other This seemed to be something that 
__label__Other      she would like to do.
__label__Other Hopefully the nutritionist can help.
__label__Other I also 
__label__Other      told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
"__label__Other      to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, "
__label__Other      and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
__label__Other      really going on and whether they are getting too low.
__label__Other She denies any 
__label__Other      kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.
__label__Other I am 
__label__Other      wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.
"__label__Other She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no "
__label__Other      nothing.
__label__Other She felt totally normal.
__label__Other So hopefully she will really 
__label__Other      record these and we will get a better idea.
__label__Other She said this always 
__label__Other      happens in the morning.
__label__Other She kept contradicting herself and had no 
__label__Other      documentation.
__label__Other I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
__label__Other Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.
"__label__Other She does drink juice, "
__label__Other      but I went over the symptoms again with her.
__label__Other She will call me if she 
__label__Other      does have any.
__label__Other 10-19-86
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Left ankle pain.
__label__Other I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.
__label__Other She said that she may do some surgery on her.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Dysuria.
__label__Other She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
__label__Other      Bactrim.
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other Yeast infection.
__label__Other She said this has also resolved.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other She complains of headache.
__label__Other She says these have been going on for two 
__label__Other      or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.
__label__Other She has had nausea and vomited once.
__label__Other This happened pretty much every 
__label__Other      day and it can be at any time of the day.
__label__Other Tylenol and Advil did not 
__label__Other      help.
__label__Other She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
__label__Other      the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.
__label__Other But she has no further prodrome.
__label__Other She says it is a banging kind of 
__label__Other      pain that is rhythmic.
__label__Other She also says she does see stars in front of 
__label__Other      her eyes when it happens.
"__label__Other I asked her if she had any hearing loss, "
__label__Other      and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
__label__Other      sometimes.
__label__Other It has been happening for a couple of weeks.
__label__Other I discussed 
__label__Other      this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
__label__Other      migraines.
__label__Other I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
__label__Other      that this would be something to do with brain tumor.
__label__Other Her neuro exam 
__label__Other      was totally normal.
__label__Other Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.
__label__Other Her gait was normal.
__label__Other Light touch was touched.
__label__Other Her toes were 
__label__Other      downgoing.
__label__Other Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.
__label__Other Her disks were 
__label__Other      sharp.
"__label__Other EOMI, PERRL."
"__label__Other I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO "
__label__Other      t.i.d.
__label__Other and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
__label__Other      her left ear.
__label__Other I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
__label__Other 6.
__label__Other Health maintenance.
__label__Other I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
__label__Other      that she might benefit from a flu shot.
__label__Other She has no interest in this 
__label__Other      at all.
__label__Other Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
__label__Other      cuff.
__label__Other Her pulse was 96.
__label__Other Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
__label__Other      285.

"__label__Other Ulysses Peralta, M.D."
__label__Other 82 March Street
"__label__Other Coalinga, FL  84635"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Peralta:
"__label__Other I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis."
__label__Other He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.
__label__Other His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.
"__label__Other He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days."
"__label__Other He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days."
__label__Other He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.
"__label__Other He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations."
__label__Other He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.
"__label__Other Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation."
__label__Other We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.
__label__Other He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.
__label__Other He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.
__label__Other The discomfort resolved into recovery.
__label__Other He had no ST segment changes.
__label__Other His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.
__label__Other There was normal RV size as well.
__label__Other There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.
__label__Other These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.
"__label__Other As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium."
"__label__Other On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds."
__label__Other Head and neck are unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.
__label__Other PMI is normal.
__label__Other S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.
__label__Other There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
__label__Other Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.
__label__Other Bowel sounds are normal.
__label__Other The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
__label__Other Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.
__label__Other Distal pulses are normal.
__label__Other His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.
__label__Other I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.
__label__Other I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.
__label__Other I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.
__label__Other His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.
__label__Other I think we can maintain our current approach.
__label__Other I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.
"__label__Other If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me."
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
__label__Other Kindest regards.
"__label__Other Sincerely yours,"

__label__Other REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
__label__Other more active.
__label__Other She is able to walk around her house without her walker.
__label__Other She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.
"__label__Other She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and "
__label__Other preparing meals.
"__label__Other She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with "
__label__Other managing her medications.
__label__Other She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
__label__Other her with this.
__label__Other She has not been out of the house much in the last 
"__label__Other several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to "
__label__Other get behind the wheel.
"__label__Other The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of "
"__label__Other breath, no change in her bowel or bladder."
"__label__Other HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite "
__label__Other has been good.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
"__label__Other with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress."
__label__Other Her weight is 104 lbs.
__label__Other Her blood pressure today is 130/72.
__label__Other Her pulse is 80 and regular today.
"__label__Other She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair."
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
__label__Other her current regimen and medications.
__label__Other We have been manipulating her 
"__label__Other 32 Weld St                             Bird, Terri"
__label__Other Page 2
"__label__Other Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was "
"__label__Other 2.5, earlier this week."
"__label__Other She will continue on her current medications, "
__label__Other as noted above.
__label__Other The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
__label__Other mental status.
__label__Other She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
__label__Other over the last several months.
__label__Other She is anxious to drive.
"__label__Other However, "
__label__Other everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
__label__Other nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.
"__label__Other I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in "
__label__Other management of her own medications.
"__label__Other Hence, our three goals that we set "
__label__Other today were:
"__label__Other Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing "
__label__Other      six months ago.
"__label__Other To get out of the house at least once a week, using either "
__label__Other      community transportation or a family member.
__label__Other To be doing the family's laundry each week.
__label__Other While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
"__label__Other drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that "
__label__Other we set.
"__label__Other Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing "
__label__Other with these goals.
"__label__Other As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse "
__label__Other see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

"__label__Other He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations)."
"__label__Other She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days."
__label__Other He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.
"__label__Other His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4."
__label__Other He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.
"__label__Other The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise."
__label__Other We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.

__label__Other He is being managed by ID.
"__label__Other His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction."
__label__Other His abdominal CT is pending.
"__label__Other He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission."
"__label__Other As such, we recommend:"
"__label__Other --F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing."
__label__Other --F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.
"__label__Other Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal."
"__label__Other Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia."
"__label__Other D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan."

"__label__Other On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting."
"__label__Other Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her."
"__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID."
"__label__Other Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease."
"__label__Other Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial."
"__label__Other She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia."
"__label__Other She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management."

"__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition."
__label__Other Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20.
__label__Other Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.
__label__Other Abdominal pain can be multifactorial.
"__label__Other I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease."
"__label__Other With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility."
__label__Other Recommendations: 
"__label__Other 1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility."
__label__Other a.
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Would not hold long acting insulin.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO"
__label__Other b.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started."
"__label__Other If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed."
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:"
"__label__Other i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units."
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner.
__label__Other Hold if NPO or PO intake poor.
__label__Other She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating.
__label__medication.metformin..after_dct e.	No metformin for now given GI upset.
"__label__Other 2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace."
__label__Other 3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac.
"__label__Other Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina."
__label__Other Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels.
"__label__Other I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential."
"__label__Other 4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response."
__label__Other Thank you for the consult.
__label__Other We will follow with you.
__label__Other Please call with any questions.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Stafford:
__label__Other      I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
__label__Other Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
__label__Other as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.
"__label__Other In summary, she is"
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
__label__Other since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.
__label__Other By
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,"
"__label__Other peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease."
__label__Other In viewing
"__label__Other her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department."
__label__Other Her
__label__Other three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.
"__label__Other She does,"
"__label__Other however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and"
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.
__label__Other These episodes are
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct relieved by nitroglycerin.
__label__Other Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
__label__Other walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
__label__Other by slowing down.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
"__label__smoker.current only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker."
__label__Other cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.
__label__Other I don't have
__label__Other fractionations and her family history is unknown.
"__label__Other A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild"
"__label__Other ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,"
__label__Other preserved LV size and function.
__label__Other She had an exercise tolerance test
__label__Other in February of 2085.
"__label__Other On a modified protocol, she went for less"
__label__Other than 4 1/2 minutes.
__label__Other This is equivalent to not even completing
__label__Other stage 1 of the standard Bruce.
"__label__Other With that, she did develop chest"
__label__Other pain and had 2 mm of ST depression.
__label__Other That study was accompanied by
__label__Other both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
__label__Other consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
__label__Other ischemia.
"__label__Other As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope"
__label__cad.mention.before_dct portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
__label__Other to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.
"__label__Other That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I"
__label__Other only have the report.
"__label__Other However, from this report, there was"
__label__Other preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
__label__Other MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies.
"__label__Other Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of"
__label__Other proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
__label__Other LAD.
__label__Other The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
__label__Other discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.
__label__Other The
__label__Other right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
__label__Other stenosis.
"__label__Other At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical"
__label__Other therapy.
__label__Other Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every"
"__label__Other other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice"
__label__medication.insulin..during_dct daily insulin therapy.
"__label__Other In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures"
__label__Other have involved the hemodialysis access.
__label__Other She has had one pregnancy
__label__Other 28 years ago without complications.
__label__Other I also elicited a history of
__label__Other some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.
__label__Other This
"__label__Other was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90"
"__label__Other regular, her weight 95 lbs."
__label__Other Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
__label__Other arm.
"__label__Other There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not"
__label__Other distended.
"__label__Other Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained."
"__label__Other There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the"
__label__Other apex.
"__label__Other Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities"
__label__Other were without edema.
"__label__Other The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,"
__label__Other diffuse STT changes.
__label__Other There were no pathologic Q waves.
__label__Other Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
"__label__Other transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac"
__label__Other status.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both"
"__label__Other shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has"
__label__Other limited functional capacity.
__label__Other The coronary angiography reveals a
__label__Other presence of multi-vessel disease.
__label__Other Even without seeing the primary
"__label__Other data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that"
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics."
"__label__Other Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery "
__label__Other bypass surgery.
"__label__Other Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak"
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.
__label__Other I
"__label__Other would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only"
__label__Other 10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.
__label__Other As
"__label__Other indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her"
"__label__Other suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling"

__label__Other She still remains with 
__label__Other difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.
__label__Other She has continued difficulty with 
__label__Other her oral cavity.
"__label__Other She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, "
"__label__Other polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura."
__label__Other She uses artificial tears and saliva.
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct She remains on insulin and estrogens.
__label__Other She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.
__label__Other She was 
__label__Other seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.
__label__Other Radiographs of the 
__label__Other wrist show chondrocalcinosis.
__label__Other She was started on Motrin with some response 
__label__Other but still has active symptoms.
__label__Other She is wearing a splint.
"__label__Other Today on exam, she is afebrile."
__label__Other There was OA involving the DIP joints.
__label__Other PIPs 
__label__Other and MCPs were nontender.
__label__Other The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
__label__Other diminished motion.
__label__Other Right wrist showed full range of motion.
"__label__Other Elbows, "
"__label__Other shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis."
__label__Other There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.
__label__Other I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.
__label__Other No fluid was obtained.
__label__Other I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.
"__label__Other Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout."
__label__Other She has chondrocalcinosis on 
__label__Other radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.
__label__Other In 
"__label__Other addition, she has primary Sjogren's."
__label__Other The two diseases are unrelated.
"__label__Other In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex "
__label__Other 200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.
__label__Other She should probably 
__label__Other take that for about five to seven days.
__label__Other Side effects were reviewed.
__label__Other I would like to see her back in four months.
__label__Other She will be returning to you 
__label__Other for further care in the interim.

__label__Other SNH#:	008-37-16
"__label__Other September 28, 2085"
"__label__Other Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085."
__label__Other Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.
__label__Other In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.
__label__Other She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.
__label__medication.diuretic..before_dct Triamterene was added.
__label__Other Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.
"__label__Other Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time."
__label__Other She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.
__label__Other Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.
__label__Other She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.
__label__Other Yamilex is generally doing well.
__label__Other She has no particular complaints.
__label__Other She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.
"__label__Other She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits."
__label__Other Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.
__label__Other Heart rate was 82 and regular.
__label__Other The HEENT examination was unremarkable.
__label__Other Neck was supple without adenopathy.
__label__Other There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.
__label__Other Chest was clear to auscultation.
__label__Other Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.
__label__Other Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.
__label__Other Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.
"__label__Other Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base."
__label__Other Assessment and plan: 
__label__Other 1.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension.
__label__Other Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.
__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Neurologic.
__label__Other Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.
__label__Other She will continue on Coumadin.
__label__Other I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Primary care issues.
__label__Other Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.
__label__Other I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.
__label__Other I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.
__label__Other I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.
__label__Other I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.

__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
__label__Other Edema.
__label__Other The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.
__label__Other She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.
"__label__Other I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable."
__label__Other She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.
__label__Other I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.
__label__Other Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.
__label__Other The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.
__label__Other I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.
__label__Other I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.
__label__Other Low back pain.
__label__Other I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.
__label__Other We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.
__label__Other We elected against using these medications today.
__label__Other History of sleep apnea.
__label__Other The patient has significant fatigue.
__label__Other This may be due to her sleep apnea.
"__label__Other In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea."
__label__Other I discussed this with her today.
__label__Other I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.
__label__Other She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.
__label__Other She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Knapp:
__label__Other It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.
"__label__Other He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain."
"__label__Other In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure."
"__label__Other He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics."
"__label__Other During his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm."
"__label__Other His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure."
"__label__Other After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35."
"__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil."
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.
__label__Other There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.
__label__Other His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.
"__label__Other He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none."
"__label__Other At the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms."
"__label__medication.nitrate..after_dct His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o."
__label__Other b.i.d.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..before_dct He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation."
__label__medication.statin..after_dct He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.
"__label__Other His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm."
"__label__Other His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139."
__label__Other It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.
"__label__Other He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family."
"__label__Other We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking."
"__label__Other He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care."
__label__Other I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other Reason for visit:
__label__Other    Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest
__label__Other Interval History:
__label__Other    Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today.
"__label__Other His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test."
"__label__Other He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so."
"__label__cad.test.before_dct His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia."
__label__Other He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.
"__label__Other Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities."
"__label__Other Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia."
"__label__Other He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol."
__label__Other The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week.
"__label__Other He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different."
"__label__Other He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty."
"__label__Other He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope."

__label__Other Assessment and plan:
__label__Other    Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath.
__label__Other I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise.
__label__Other We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.

"__label__Other Dear Dr Chavez,"
__label__Other Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.
"__label__Other He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home."
__label__Other He has not sustained any significant injuries.
"__label__Other He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins."
__label__Other Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.
"__label__Other He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees."
"__label__Other Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance."
"__label__Other Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet."
__label__Other Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.
__label__Other Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.
__label__Other This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162.
__label__Other This most likely is a MGUS.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy."
__label__Other The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.
__label__Other Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.
__label__Other He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.
__label__Other I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control.
__label__Other Follow-up in 6 months
"__label__Other Sincerely,"

__label__Other      MRN: 89276954
__label__Other Dear Usha:
__label__Other I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up
__label__Other cardiovascular examination.
__label__Other She has been reasonably stable since
__label__Other I saw her last in July.
__label__Other She has had several episodes of chest
__label__Other discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite
__label__Other transient.
__label__Other The frequency has been less than one time per month.
__label__Other The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping
__label__Other mall.
__label__Other She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.
__label__Other She has
__label__Other not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
"__label__Other She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying"
"__label__Other transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax."
__label__Other She
"__label__Other denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip"
__label__Other pain with walking.
__label__Other She still notes paresthesias of both feet.
__label__Other She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.
__label__medication.arb..after_dct Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o.
"__label__Other b.i.d.,"

"__label__Other q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o."
__label__Other and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
__label__Other p.r.n.
__label__Other On examination she appears well.
__label__Other Weight is 142 pounds.
__label__Other Blood
__label__Other pressure is 140/60.
__label__Other Heart rate is 50 and regular.
__label__Other Neck veins
__label__Other are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.
__label__Other There are bilateral carotid
__label__Other bruits.
__label__Other Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to
__label__Other auscultation.
__label__Other On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth
__label__Other intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
__label__Other There is a 1+ left
__label__Other ventricular lift.
__label__Other The first heart sound is normal.
__label__Other The second

__label__Other is split physiologically.
__label__Other There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic
__label__Other murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along
__label__Other the left sternal border.
__label__Other There is a fourth heart sound at the
__label__Other apex.
"__label__Other Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no"
__label__Other hepatosplenomegaly.
__label__Other Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral
"__label__Other femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft"
"__label__Other pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis"
"__label__Other pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal"
__label__Other pulses.
__label__Other Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree
__label__Other AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral
__label__Other myocardial infarction.
__label__Other There has been no diagnostic change since
"__label__Other July 18, 2086."
"__label__Other Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,"
__label__Other 2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery
__label__Other and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
__label__Other The
__label__Other velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent
__label__Other calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February
__label__Other 2086.
"__label__Other Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left"
__label__Other femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased
__label__Other velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid
"__label__Other thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086."
__label__Other The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent
__label__Other with no evidence of significant stenoses.
"__label__Other In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:"
__label__Other 1.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct Coronary artery disease.
__label__Other Status post coronary artery bypass
__label__Other surgery.
__label__Other LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and

"__label__Other As noted previously, I prefer to"

__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Peripheral arterial disease.
__label__Other Both grafts are patent but the
__label__Other left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have
__label__Other a significant stenosis.
__label__Other I have asked her to discuss this finding
__label__Other with you further.

__label__Other Dear Dr. Nunes:
__label__Other Thank you for asking me to see Mr.
__label__Other Craft.
__label__Other Patient says he was diagnosed 
__label__Other as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
__label__Other Xian and was treated with steroids at the time.
__label__Other It's not clear what CNS 
__label__Other or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time.
__label__Other Because of complex 
__label__Other partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
__label__Other referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
__label__Other estradiol level was in the 80s.
__label__Other His testosterone was up but available 
__label__Other testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
__label__Other said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures.
__label__Other Said he was doing 
__label__Other fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred.
__label__Other He 
__label__Other said his neck felt full and warm.
__label__Other His head felt like it was going to 
__label__Other explode.
"__label__Other He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was "
__label__Other vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
__label__Other right.
__label__Other Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
__label__Other postnasal drip.
"__label__Other Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and "
__label__Other anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
__label__Other other results).
"__label__Other He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis "
__label__Other on his legs.
"__label__Other No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth "
__label__Other or gum except that he has to wear his glasses.
__label__Other Recently had some teeth 
__label__Other removed.
__label__Other Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough.
__label__Other No other 
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension.
__label__Other No GI 
__label__Other problems.
"__label__Other Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to "
__label__Other benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR.

__label__Other smoked.
__label__Other He is an only child.

__label__Other He's retired since 2103.
__label__Other Was 
__label__Other a stage manager.
__label__Other Physical exam.
__label__Other Somewhat overweight gentleman.
__label__Other Blood pressure was 160/80.
__label__Other Pulse was 88 and regular.
"__label__Other Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on "
"__label__Other forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees."
__label__Other One 
__label__Other small node in the left side of his neck.
__label__Other Mouth and throat was clear.
__label__Other Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left.
__label__Other Ear drums fine.
__label__Other Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
__label__Other forehead).
__label__Other Chest clear.
__label__Other No CVA tenderness.
__label__Other Heart: No murmurs.
"__label__Other Abdomen, "
"__label__Other no organs, masses, tenderness but obese."
"__label__Other Extremity, joint exam fine."
__label__Other Neurological fine.
__label__Other I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
__label__Other symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection.
"__label__Other However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome "
"__label__Other and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to "
__label__Other also exclude lupus and vasculitis.
__label__Other Basically I told him to take Flonase 
__label__Other twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
__label__Other cleared up.
__label__Other In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
"__label__Other stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the "
__label__Other testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of

"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding "
"__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain."
__label__Other Patient 
__label__Other also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
"__label__Other regarding increased appetite, decreased memory, "
__label__Other Page 3
"__label__Other decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased "
"__label__Other hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of "
__label__Other cholinergic transmission problems.
__label__Other Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
__label__Other Aricept to improve his memory.
__label__Other Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
__label__Other for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted.
__label__Other Thank you again for asking me to see him.
__label__Other Please let me know if I can be 
__label__Other of further assistance.
"__label__Other Sincerely yours,"

__label__Other HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
__label__Other checkup.
__label__Other Patient appears to be doing fine.
__label__Other She has been compliant with her 
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also "
__label__medication.diuretic..during_dct hydrochlorothiazide.
"__label__Other Since our last meeting, the patient has lost "

__label__Other She has been exercising on a daily basis 
"__label__Other and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and "
__label__Other beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
__label__Other was 120/80 in both arms.
__label__Other The patient was complaining of some ankle 
"__label__Other swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been "
"__label__Other on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent "
__label__Other admission.
"__label__medication.diuretic..during_dct I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which "

__label__Other diastolic was 80-90.
__label__Other The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
"__label__Other than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest."
__label__Other The patient

"__label__Other remarkably normal, given his medical complaints."
__label__Other The patient's 
__label__Other cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.
__label__Other Review 
__label__Other of systems otherwise negative.
__label__Other Physical exam is not performed at this time.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure was 152/76 
"__label__Other on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 "
"__label__Other and unlabored, and pulse was 70."
__label__Other ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
__label__Other problems coming in for follow-up.
__label__Other 1.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct      Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic "
__label__Other      hypertrophy.
"__label__Other The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, "
"__label__Other      and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while "
__label__Other      standing.
"__label__Other The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which "
__label__Other      hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
"__label__Other      hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped."
__label__Other If 
"__label__Other      the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to "
__label__Other      Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other BPH - please see above.
__label__Other The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
__label__Other 3.   ?
__label__cad.mention.before_dct coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
"__label__Other      slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable "
__label__Other      for this gentleman.
__label__Other I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
"__label__Other      ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s "
__label__Other      MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL
"__label__Other 476 Will St                           Vicente, Kadeem"
__label__Other PAGE 2
__label__Other      or low 50s.
__label__Other Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
__label__Other      therapy.
__label__Other I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
"__label__Other      about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he "
__label__Other      will be put on an antilipid drug.
__label__Other 4.
"__label__Other GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I "
__label__Other      will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
__label__Other      point.
"__label__Other Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be "
__label__Other      placed on Prilosec.
"__label__Other I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of "
__label__Other his use of Hytrin.

__label__Other Dr. Keys
"__label__Other RE:Fair, Bill"
__label__Other MR#:220-41-86-4
__label__Other Dear Dr. Keys:
__label__Other Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 
__label__Other right knee.
__label__Other As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.
"__label__Other He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, "
__label__Other mainly related to sports injuries.
__label__Other He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.
__label__Other It got so 
__label__Other bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that.
__label__Other It has slowly got better since then.
__label__Other At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 
__label__Other activity but he also has rest and night pain.
__label__Other He has a restricted walking 
__label__Other distance.
"__label__Other With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and "
__label__Other requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.
__label__Other He has 
__label__Other noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.
__label__Other With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 
__label__Other Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 
__label__Other have a colonoscopy in the near future.
__label__Other He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.
"__label__Other On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than "
__label__Other the left.
__label__Other He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.
__label__Other He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 
__label__Other arthritis.
__label__Other He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 
__label__Other degrees.
__label__Other His varus deformity is not fully correctable.
__label__Other He has grade 5 
__label__Other quadriceps power.
__label__Other X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 
__label__Other obliteration of joint space on the right side.
__label__Other I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 
__label__Other arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.
__label__Other We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 
"__label__Other osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement."
__label__Other At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 
__label__Other enough to warrant operative intervention.
__label__Other We would certainly reconsider 
"__label__Other should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, "
__label__Other instilling some corticosteroids.
__label__Other We have advised him that this will only 
__label__Other provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 
__label__Other some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.
__label__Other We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 
__label__Other reassess him.
__label__Other Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 
__label__Other ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 
__label__Other knee and instill some corticosteroid.
__label__Other With kind regards.
"__label__Other Yours sincerely, "

__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a complicated 72-year-old woman who has a history significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in January of 2080 at Madison Medical Center for aortic stenosis.
"__label__Other She also has a history of interstitial lung disease, maintained on prednisone slow taper."
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
"__label__Other She had been residing at a nursing home and complained of chest pain, jaw pain and bilateral shoulder pain for approximately 1 week."
"__label__Other Eventually, the patient was transferred to Wheeling Clinic."
"__label__Other Here in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, which improved to the 90s with volume and blood resuscitation."
__label__Other She also found to be tachycardic and have a hematocrit of 25%.
__label__Other The patient was also found to be guaiac positive on stool occult blood.
__label__Other Her troponin was mildly elevated.
__label__Other The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and her chest discomfort has improved.
"__label__Other She also underwent echocardiography on 03/26/80, which was a fair quality study with a mildly dilated left ventricle, mild LVH, septal flattening consistent with RV pressure overload and an estimated ejection fraction of 35% to 40%."
__label__Other Diastolic dysfunction was also noted.
__label__Other There was dilatation of both atria and the right ventricle with mildly reduced RV systolic function.
__label__Other The aortic valve could not be well visualized.
__label__Other There was reduced cusp excursion with severe aortic stenosis.
__label__Other There was mild tricuspid regurgitation and estimated PASP of 60 to 65 mmHg plus RA pressure.
__label__Other There was mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation with a posteriorly directed jet.
__label__Other The aortic valve peak gradient was 115.6 mmHg and mean gradient was 77.05 mmHg.
__label__Other Valve area was not calculated.
__label__Other The patient was transferred to Madison Medical Center for treatment of her symptoms.
__label__Other She notes that her chest pain has improved.
__label__Other She notes that she had worsening of her baseline dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath at rest starting in September that has been gradually progressing.
__label__Other She denies trouble breathing at night.
__label__Other She also notes peripheral edema that seems worse now than it did back in September.
"__label__Other She denies any fevers, chills or cough."
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in 2078, BOOP, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and congestive heart failure."
__label__Other MEDICATIONS:  Her discharge medications from Wheeling Clinic were prednisone 25 mg p.o.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct once daily, Humalog insulin sliding scale, metoprolol 6.25 mg p.o."

"__label__Other once daily, Milk of magnesium p.r.n."
__label__Other and MiraLax p.r.n.
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.
__label__Other SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home.
"__label__Other She typically ambulates with a walker, though she has become dyspneic even ambulating a few feet."
__label__smoker.past She quit smoking 40 years ago.
__label__Other There is no alcohol use.
"__label__Other She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer."
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6."
__label__Other JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.
"__label__Other Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right."
__label__Other Air movement is fair.
__label__Other There are no carotid bruits.
__label__Other Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.
"__label__Other On heart exam, PMI could not be felt."
__label__Other There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.
__label__Other There are no rubs or gallops.
"__label__Other Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema."
__label__Other There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.
"__label__Other EKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG."
"__label__Other Lab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose."
__label__Other Magnesium and calcium were normal.
__label__Other Albumin is low at 2.6.
__label__Other Liver function tests are normal.
"__label__Other Creatinine kinase is 15, troponin is 0.7 and B-natriuretic peptide is 2510."
__label__Other Thyroid studies are pending.
__label__Other Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7.
"__label__Other CBC shows mild anemia with hematocrit of 35.8% with normal hemoglobin of 12.2, elevated white count at 13.32 and platelet count of 305,000."
__label__Other Coagulation studies are normal.
"__label__Other IMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved."
__label__Other The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.
__label__Other I think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.
"__label__Other On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology."
"__label__Other Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation."
"__label__Other If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery."
"__label__Other In addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray."
"__label__Other Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it."
__label__Other Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure.
__label__Other Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.

"__label__Other EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE"
__label__Other I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.
__label__Other Forrest.
__label__Other I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the
"__label__Other patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's"
"__label__Other chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and"
__label__Other disposition with the patient.
__label__Other CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.
__label__Other HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple
__label__Other medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.
__label__Other At her
__label__Other rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent
__label__Other here.
__label__Other The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable
"__label__Other for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent"
__label__Other hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the
__label__Other end of December through the beginning of January.
__label__Other The patient's
__label__Other chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the
__label__Other patient has been doing well at rehab since.
"__label__Other However, today was"
__label__Other noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.
__label__Other She had
__label__Other shortness of breath as well.
__label__Other Her oxygen saturations improved
__label__Other marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to
__label__Other nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.
__label__Other The patient was
__label__Other treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement
__label__Other and is noted to be quite tachypneic.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,"
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,"
"__label__Other anemia, and cervical fracture."
"__label__smoker.unknown SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited"
__label__Other by the severity of the patient's presentation.
"__label__medication.statin..after_dct MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,"
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,"
"__label__Other Colace, and Xalatan."
__label__Other ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.
"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some"
"__label__Other degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and"
__label__Other answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.
__label__Other Vital signs are as
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,"
__label__Other and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.
__label__Other HEENT exam is
"__label__Other atraumatic, normal to inspection."
__label__Other The patient has a large tongue
__label__Other and her uvula is not visible at all.
__label__Other Neck is immobilized in a
__label__obese.mention.before_dct C-collar and is obese.
__label__Other Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath
__label__Other sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory
__label__Other use.
__label__Other Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without
__label__Other murmur.
__label__Other Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.
__label__Other Abdomen is
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or"
"__label__Other masses, or guarding, or rebound."
"__label__Other Skin is intact, warm, and dry"
__label__Other without any lesions or rash.
__label__Other Musculoskeletal exam reveals
__label__Other tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib
__label__Other fractures.
"__label__Other Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty"
__label__Other speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic
__label__Other deficit.
__label__Other LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.
__label__Other White
"__label__Other blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is"
"__label__Other at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2."
__label__Other LFTs within
__label__Other normal limit.
__label__Other INR 1.2.
__label__Other D-dimer significantly elevated.
__label__Other EKG
__label__Other demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
"__label__Other IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which"
__label__Other are present previously but possibly slightly increased.
__label__Other EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given
__label__medication.nitrate..during_dct Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was
__label__Other also started on CPAP.
__label__Other She seemed to be improving clinically for
__label__Other some period of time but then began to decline in her mental
__label__Other status.
__label__Other At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia.
"__label__Other Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient"
__label__Other likely needed intubation.
__label__Other We had hope to hold off to do a
"__label__Other thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines"
__label__Other such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the
__label__Other procedure.
"__label__Other On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable"
"__label__Other throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory"
__label__Other distress.
__label__Other Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex
"__label__Other her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful"
__label__Other in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in
__label__Other between those attempts.
"__label__Other For full details of the procedure,"
__label__Other please see the attached procedure note.
__label__Other Thoracic Surgery was
__label__Other consulted.
__label__Other They arrived as the patient was being intubated.
__label__Other At
__label__Other this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to
__label__Other determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural
__label__Other effusion and whether it is loculated.
__label__Other This study will be
__label__Other performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in
__label__Other the ICU.
__label__Other A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and
__label__Other the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.
__label__Other ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********
__label__Other PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
__label__Other SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.
__label__Other TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural
__label__Other effusion.
__label__Other FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.
__label__Other DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.
__label__Other CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

__label__Other Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a

"__label__Other She has no new complaints, "

"__label__Other She denies any increasing polyuria, "
"__label__Other polydipsia, polyphagia."
"__label__Other Says until yesterday, she had been taking all "
"__label__Other of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in "
__label__Other the morning.
__label__Other I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
"__label__Other being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain "
__label__Other that she has been taking them.
__label__Other It is not entirely clear to me whether 
__label__Other this is true or not.
"__label__Other Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation."
__label__Other She says 
__label__Other she is feeling a little bit better.
__label__Other She was recently started on 
"__label__Other risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at "
__label__Other the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
__label__Other a month.
__label__Other She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.
__label__Other She says overall 
"__label__Other she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge "
__label__Other drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.
__label__Other We again discussed the 
__label__Other importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.
"__label__cad.symptom.during_dct Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina "
__label__Other after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or

__label__Other      over the past couple of months.
"__label__Other In any event, she most likely need "
__label__Other      a higher dose of sulphonurea.
__label__Other We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
"__label__Other      today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase "

__label__Other Re:  Kenneth Umstead
__label__Other      MR#  401-10-87-8
__label__Other Dear Jac:
__label__Other I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
__label__Other he feels he has actually improved.
__label__Other His primary limitation had been
"__label__Other his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in"
__label__Other the past.
__label__Other We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
"__label__Other and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study"
__label__Other two years ago.
__label__Other The post volume recordings were normal in each leg.
__label__Other Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
__label__Other consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.
__label__Other No
__label__Other systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.
__label__Other These were
"__label__Other unchanged from January, 2072."
__label__Other Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
__label__Other physically active and is less limited.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,"
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d."
"__label__Other Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four"
__label__Other polyps which were removed.
"__label__Other Apparently, no malignant cells were"
__label__Other seen in the pathologic specimens.
"__label__Other On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart"
"__label__Other rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs."
__label__Other HEENT unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest
__label__Other was clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
"__label__Other degrees, PMI is normal."
__label__Other S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
__label__Other split.
__label__Other There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
__label__Other lower left sternal border.
__label__Other Abdominal exam was unremarkable.
__label__Other Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
"__label__Other His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis"
"__label__Other deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent"
__label__Other with his left anterior hemiblock.
__label__Other I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.
__label__Other He asked that I see him
"__label__Other again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy"
__label__Other to do so.
__label__Other If any problems develop in the interim please don't
__label__Other hesitate to contact me.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to participate
__label__Other in his care.

__label__Other  Attending Note
__label__Other I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.
__label__Other I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute."
__label__Other Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.
__label__Other CTA was also normal.
__label__Other He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past.
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.
__label__Other His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.
__label__Other It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;
__label__Other The exam today showed:
__label__Other Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
__label__Other Left APD
__label__Other Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
__label__Other Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.
__label__Other Was not in UMN fashion.
"__label__Other Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal."
__label__Other Assessment:  
__label__Other Status post TIA possibly related to AF
__label__Other Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.
__label__Other The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.
__label__Other Plan:
__label__Other Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
__label__Other Continue 
__label__medication.statin..before_dct ASA and coumadin and statin
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Continued HTN and DM control

__label__Other   Dear Dr. Yingling:
"__label__Other   Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,"
__label__cad.mention.after_dct   for her problem of coronary ischemia.
"__label__Other As you know, Ms."
__label__Other   Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct   essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is
__label__Other   postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest
__label__Other   tightness associated with exertion.
__label__Other A stress MIBI SPECT
__label__Other   study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and
__label__Other   basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex
__label__Other   distribution.
__label__Other The details of the study include an exercise
__label__Other   protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and
"__label__Other   15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from"
"__label__Other   74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and"
__label__Other   increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a
"__label__Other   rate pressure product of 33,390)."
__label__Other The test was stopped due
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct   to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.
__label__Other EKG
"__label__Other   demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and"
"__label__Other   V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias."
__label__Other Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her
"__label__Other   current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and"
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct   verapamil 240mg q.d.
__label__Other A recent lipid panel demonstrated a
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_ldl.before_dct   total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39."
"__label__Other On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing"
"__label__Other   woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute"
"__label__Other   and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm."
__label__Other Jugular
__label__Other   venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.
__label__Other Carotids
__label__Other   demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.
__label__Other Chest
__label__Other   examination was clear to auscultation.
__label__Other Heart examination
"__label__Other   demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split"
"__label__Other   S2, no murmurs or rubs."
__label__Other Abdominal examination was 
__label__Other   Page 2
__label__Other   unremarkable.
__label__Other Peripheral examination demonstrated no
__label__Other   peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.
__label__Other EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal
__label__Other   EKG.
__label__Other I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive
__label__Other   coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the
__label__Other   probability of her having single vessel coronary artery
__label__cad.symptom.before_dct   disease as the culprit for her chest pain.
__label__Other We reviewed the
__label__Other   options which include medical therapy and/or coronary
__label__Other   angiography and possible angioplasty.
__label__Other I made no solid
"__label__Other   recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty"
__label__Other   approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead
__label__Other   to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical
"__label__Other   therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and"
__label__Other   I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of
__label__Other   single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and
__label__Other   only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom
__label__Other   tolerance.
__label__Other She and her husband are going to reflect on
__label__Other   these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the
__label__Other   week.
__label__Other If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography
"__label__Other   and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately"
__label__Other   in Cardiology.
__label__Other I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see
__label__Other   her in the office.
__label__Other Please do not hesitate to contact me if
__label__Other   I can be of any further assistance.

"__label__Other normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-"
__label__Other waves.
__label__Other Hematocrit and troponin are pending.
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 
__label__Other problems as follows:
__label__Other Type 2 diabetes.
__label__Other Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 
__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct the 9.0.
__label__Other She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 
__label__Other try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.
"__label__Other At this point, it "
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 
__label__Other regimen starting with b.i.d.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct NPH, and we will refer her to the "
"__label__Other diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month "
__label__Other with a plan to transition her at that time.
__label__Other Her urine 
__label__Other microalbumin was negative a few months ago.
__label__Other We will recheck 
__label__Other her hemoglobin A1c today.
__label__Other She has been to the ophthalmologist 
"__label__Other recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet."
"__label__Other Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest "
__label__Other pain is somewhat concerning.
__label__Other She does have coronary disease 
__label__Other as per her MIBI just over a year ago.
__label__Other She is taking an 
__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct aspirin and a beta-blocker.
"__label__Other Her EKG today is normal, and she "
__label__Other has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 
__label__Other exertion.
"__label__Other Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent "
__label__Other pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 
"__label__medication.aspirin..during_dct the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin "
__label__Other and beta-blocker.
__label__Other I will repeat her stress test to see if her 
__label__Other ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 
__label__Other referring her to Cardiology.

"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would "
__label__Other prefer better blood pressure control.
__label__Other She agreed to try the 
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she "
__label__Other thinks it disagrees with her.
__label__Other I told her I felt the headache 
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..after_dct was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.
"__label__Other Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, "
"__label__Other I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left "
__label__Other today without receiving one.
__label__Other I will see her back in clinic in one month.

__label__Other RE:  Roberta Vincent
__label__Other      MR #380-18-32-2
__label__Other Dear Dr. Long:
__label__Other Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.
"__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,"
__label__Other 2092.
__label__Other Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
__label__Other Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
__label__Other failure of unknown etiology.
__label__Other She is six years status post
__label__Other hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
__label__Other leiomyosarcoma was discovered.
__label__Other She has an extensive history of
"__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension."
__label__Other She had one stillborn
"__label__Other infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions."
__label__Other SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..during_dct Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,"
"__label__medication.statin..during_dct furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,"
"__label__Other Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex"
__label__Other 250 mg qid.
__label__Other On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
__label__Other distress.
"__label__Other Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs."
__label__Other Temperature
__label__Other is normal.
__label__Other Pulse is 88 beats per minute.
__label__Other Blood pressure is
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct 178/96.
__label__Other There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.
__label__Other There is a
__label__Other buffalo hump.
__label__Other The lungs show scattered wheezing.
__label__Other Cardiovascular
__label__Other exam is normal.
__label__Other There are discolorations of the skin across the
"__label__Other neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not"
__label__Other raised.
__label__obese.mention.during_dct The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.
__label__Other ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.
__label__Other The
__label__Other extremities show trace edema.
__label__Other There are several areas of
__label__Other superficial petechiae.
"__label__Other In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of"
__label__Other unclear etiology.
__label__Other She does report an episode of lower extremity
__label__Other swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.
__label__Other ThisRoberta Vincent
"__label__Other MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092"
__label__Other raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
__label__Other in a chronic phase.
__label__Other Other diagnostic possibilities include other
__label__Other forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
__label__Other erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions.
"__label__Other Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this"
__label__Other time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
__label__Other risk due to her body habitus.
__label__Other I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
__label__Other Vincent.
__label__Other Although she has no medical conditions which would
"__label__Other preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her"
__label__obese.mention.after_dct obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
__label__Other hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.
__label__Other I have
__label__Other encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
__label__Other order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
__label__Other transplantation.
"__label__Other Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent"
"__label__Other of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not"
__label__Other been performed previously.
__label__Other I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
__label__Other kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
__label__Other meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
__label__Other fistula or placement of a graft.
__label__Other Thank you once again for your kind referral.

"__label__Other Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100."
__label__Other Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.
__label__Other 3) Hemoglobin A1c.

__label__Other My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.
"__label__Other I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment."

__label__Other The patient has known history of coronary artery 
"__label__cad.mention.after_dct disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, "
"__label__Other however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more "

__label__Other He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 
__label__Other rested throughout the rest of the day.
"__label__Other Then last night, he had "
"__label__Other some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of."
__label__Other Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 
__label__Other morning hours.
__label__Other He felt he was wheezing.

__label__Other got up and walked around.
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 
__label__Other morning.
__label__medication.nitrate..before_dct These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 
"__label__Other obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms."
__label__Other He then came in 
"__label__Other to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the "

__label__Other He states that his breathing has been good.
__label__Other He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.
__label__Other He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.
__label__Other A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.
"__label__Other He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting."
__label__Other He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver."

__label__Other ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
__label__Other 1.
"__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July."
"__label__Other He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time."
__label__Other He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other BPH.
__label__Other We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.
__label__Other Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Hypertension.
"__label__Other This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month."
"__label__Other If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this."
__label__Other 4.
__label__Other COPD.
"__label__Other Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen."
__label__Other He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
__label__Other 5.
__label__Other Elevated cholesterol.
__label__Other His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.
__label__Other If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
__label__Other 6.
__label__Other Abnormal liver function tests.
__label__Other These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology."
__label__Other Follow up with me is in one month.

__label__Other ASSESSMENT & PLAN
"__label__Other 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations."
__label__Other The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.
"__label__Other Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely."
"__label__Other Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results."
"__label__Other However, microembolic disease may be a possibility."
"__label__Other Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted."
"__label__Other As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely."
__label__Other LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.
"__label__Other One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension."
__label__Other A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.
"__label__Other Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly."
"__label__Other However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning."
"__label__Other Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative."
__label__Other CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.
__label__Other Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.

"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct CC: 79 yo man hx depression, psychosis, insomnia, CAD, syncope, HTN, DMT2, carotid stenosis, PVD, here for PCP and f/u of these and other chronic health problems"
__label__Other HPI: Patient recently presented to BMH with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac.
__label__Other No seizure activity.
__label__Other He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month.
"__label__Other Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma."
"__label__Other He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf."
__label__Other WMA and LA dilation.
__label__Other Cardiology was therefore consulted.
__label__Other An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf.
"__label__cad.test.before_dct lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV."
__label__Other The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic.
__label__Other An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21.
__label__cad.test.before_dct Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.
"__label__Other In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months."
"__label__Other Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention."

__label__Other The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess.
"__label__Other SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal."
__label__Other The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen.
"__label__Other Just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (""I lost my mortal soul"")."

"__label__Other Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy."
__label__Other The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell.
"__label__Other He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him."
"__label__Other He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead."

__label__Other Record date: 2061-10-12
"__label__Other Joanne Elyssia Pagan, M.D."
__label__Other LEPROSARIUM
__label__Other 509 Ferncroft Drive
"__label__Other Union City, CT 33636"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Pagan:
__label__Other Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a follow-up visit.
"__label__Other As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts."
"__label__Other Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda."
"__label__Other In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty."
__label__Other A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.
__label__Other She is not particularly active.
__label__Other She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.
"__label__Other Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.
__label__smoker.never She is a nonsmoker.
"__label__Other On examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits."
__label__Other Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.
__label__Other Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.
"__label__Other On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused."
"__label__Other On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions."
"__label__Other The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular."
__label__Other There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.
__label__Other There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.
__label__Other This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.
__label__Other A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.
__label__Other The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.
"__label__Other As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded."
__label__Other Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.
"__label__Other At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign."
__label__Other The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.
"__label__Other Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated."
__label__Other I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.
"__label__Other At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic."
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.
"__label__Other I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration."
"__label__Other At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation."
"__label__Other If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient."

__label__Other Dear Dr. Easterling: 
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078.
"__label__Other He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis."
__label__Other He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning.
__label__Other His episodes of chest pain are interesting.
__label__Other He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching.
__label__Other The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset.
__label__Other They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge.
__label__Other He is otherwise in fairly good health.
__label__Other Past medical history:
__label__Other    1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
__label__Other 2) Palpitations 
__label__Other 3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071
__label__Other 	Allergies:
__label__Other No known drug allergy
__label__Other 	Medications (Confirmed):
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct aspirin  81 mg po daily
__label__Other penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day
__label__Other 	Family history:
__label__Other    Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack.
"__label__Other He has four siblings, all in good health."
__label__Other Social history:
"__label__Other    He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health."
"__label__Other He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine."
__label__Other Habits: He has never used street drugs.
__label__smoker.never He does not smoke tobacco.
__label__Other He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.
__label__Other Review of systems:
__label__Other    Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.
__label__Other Physical examination:
__label__Other -BP: 110/70  
__label__Other -Pulse: 59  BPM regular
__label__Other -resp.
__label__Other rate: 16  unlabored
__label__Other -Skin:   without lesions or nodules.

__label__Other Conjunctivae noninjected.
__label__Other Mucous membranes moist.
__label__Other No oropharyngeal lesions.
__label__Other -Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
"__label__Other -Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion."

"__label__Other -Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses."
"__label__Other -Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema."
__label__Other -Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.
__label__Other EKG:
__label__Other    10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia.
__label__Other Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.
__label__Other Assessment and plan:
__label__Other    Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort.
__label__Other Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se.
"__label__Other It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past."
__label__Other We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed.
__label__Other I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress.

__label__Other Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 
__label__Other s/p XRT to esophagus
__label__Other Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 
__label__Other History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.
"__label__Other On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time."
__label__Other The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.
__label__Other Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
"__label__Other On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma."
__label__Other Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement.
"__label__Other Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease."
__label__Other On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.
"__label__Other This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space."
__label__Other The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.
__label__Other There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung.
__label__Other PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer.
__label__Other The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate.
__label__Other He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.
"__label__Other He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation."
"__label__Other He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating."
__label__Other No bleeding.

__label__Other Hypertension.

"__label__Other      well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH."
__label__Other His blood pressure 
__label__Other      appears to be well controlled on this regimen.
__label__Other One of the issues 
__label__Other      would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.
"__label__Other The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and "
__label__cad.event.before_dct      there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
"__label__Other      option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a "
__label__Other      third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct      Zestril with a beta-blocker.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other GERD.
__label__Other The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg 
__label__Other      to be taken at bedtime.

__label__Other      immediately.
"__label__Other The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which "

"__label__Other BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to "
__label__Other      be working quite well.
__label__Other The patient notes that there is less 
"__label__Other      dribbling, less nocturnal urination."
__label__Other The patient does take Lasix 
__label__Other      20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any 
__label__Other      difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.

__label__Other The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
__label__Other      was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG 
__label__Other      changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he 
__label__Other      would like to stay on this.
__label__Other Patient has enough to last until I see 
__label__Other      him next time.
__label__Other I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
__label__Other patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.
__label__Other The cholesterol 
"__label__Other is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the "
__label__Other patient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to 
__label__Other treatment.

__label__Other -Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
__label__Other -Would recommend checking PPD
__label__Other -Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.
__label__Other Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.
__label__Other There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.

__label__Other DIAGNOSIS:
__label__Other 1.
__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct Hypertension.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Pedal edema.
__label__Other 3.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Diabetes.
__label__Other HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
__label__Other up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
__label__Other past 2 weeks.
"__label__Other When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very"
__label__Other dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
__label__Other to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
__label__Other creatinine and BUN.
__label__Other She responded well to this and then did
__label__Other well for a week or so.
__label__Other Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
__label__Other increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening.
"__label__Other Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is"
__label__Other up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.
__label__Other Of
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it"
__label__Other was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.
__label__Other She reports her
"__label__Other blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from"
__label__Other 90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.
__label__Other She
__label__Other has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
__label__Other months.
__label__Other She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.
__label__Other reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
__label__Other normal as well.
"__label__Other She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased"
__label__Other shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.
__label__Other No fever or
__label__Other chills.
__label__Other Remainder review of systems negative.
__label__Other She does
__label__Other report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
__label__Other has had but has noted it over the past few months.
__label__Other MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.
__label__Other ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
__label__Other distress.
__label__Other Her skin is very tanned.
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure 148/62,"
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight"
__label__Other is up about 6 pounds for her.
__label__Other HEENT within normal limits.
__label__Other Neck: no JVD.
"__label__Other Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no"
__label__Other crackles or rhonchi.
"__label__Other Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,"
__label__Other II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.
__label__Other Abdomen is
__label__Other benign.
__label__Other Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
__label__Other mid shin.
__label__Other IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
__label__Other New pedal edema.
"__label__Other Reviewing patient's recent lab results,"
__label__Other she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
__label__Other the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
__label__Other improved.
__label__Other I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Norvasc.
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and"
__label__Other she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
__label__Other it may take a few days to resolve.
__label__Other Will consider increasing
__label__Other her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Norvasc and her labs.
__label__Other Will check basic metabolic panel and
__label__Other urinalysis as well.
__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.
__label__Other Will start
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
__label__Other the next few days.
__label__Other Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
__label__Other to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
__label__Other for a repeat blood pressure check.
__label__Other The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
__label__Other see if there is anything more we can do to change her
__label__medication.insulin..before_dct insulin regimen.
__label__Other The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
__label__Other otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
__label__Other sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

__label__Other The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.

__label__Other They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process.
"__label__Other He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM."
__label__Other We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out.
__label__Other Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.
"__label__Other In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically."
__label__Other Is any of this TB?
__label__Other Recommend:
__label__Other -- skeletal survey
__label__Other -- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas
__label__Other -- beta-2 microglobulin
__label__Other -- reticulocyte count
__label__Other -- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco
__label__Other -- guaiac all stools
__label__Other -- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential
"__label__Other -- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today."

__label__Other 3.
__label__Other No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the extracranial or

__label__Other ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct 75 yo woman with a history of stroke, HTN who presents with L arm numbness."
"__label__Other While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke."
__label__Other These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli.
"__label__Other Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus."
__label__Other - Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing
__label__Other - Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi
__label__Other - Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
__label__Other - Admit to Internal Medicine service

__label__Other who presents for routine follow up.
__label__Other CURRENT ISSUES:
__label__Other 1.
__label__diabetes.mention.before_dct Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
__label__Other The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
"__label__diabetes.a1c.before_dct      approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5."
__label__Other We discussed 
"__label__Other      this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who "
__label__medication.insulin..before_dct      is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
__label__Other      tighter control.
__label__Other He states he has been following his finger 
"__label__Other      sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this."
__label__Other His 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
__label__Other      regular.
"__label__medication.insulin..after_dct At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of "
__label__Other      regular at dinnertime.
__label__Other He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
__label__Other 2.
__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.after_dct Hypercholesterolemia.
"__label__Other Of note, the patient recently experienced a "
__label__medication.statin..before_dct      rash to his simvastatin.
__label__Other This resolved on the discontinuation of 
__label__medication.statin..before_dct      the simvastatin.
"__label__hyperlipidemia.high_chol..before_dct Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in "
"__label__Other      January, 2067."
__label__Other He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
"__label__Other      institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid "
__label__Other      fats.
__label__Other 3.
__label__Other Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.
__label__Other The 
__label__Other      patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
__label__Other      Jobst stocking.
__label__Other He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
"__label__Other      wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is "
__label__Other      compliant with the stocking.
__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.
__label__Other Heart rate:  76.
__label__Other Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.
__label__Other Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
"__label__Other rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs."
__label__Other Lungs are clear to auscultation.
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds."

__label__Other There is 1+ pedal edema of 
"__label__Other the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking."
__label__Other Foot 
__label__Other care remains excellent.
__label__Other IMPRESSION:                         
__label__Other We will increase the patient's 
__label__medication.insulin..after_dct      morning NPH dose to 40 units.
__label__Other He will once again try to become 
__label__Other      more compliant with his diet.
__label__Other He will be scheduled for a follow up 
__label__Other      ophthalmologic examination.
__label__Other We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
__label__medication.statin..before_dct      his recent rash to simvastin.
__label__Other We will re-check a fasting lipid 
__label__Other      profile as well as a set of LFT's.

"__label__Other Dear Dr. Keller,"
__label__Other Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.
__label__Other Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.
__label__Other We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband."
"__label__Other This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours."
__label__Other She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.
__label__Other In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.
__label__Other The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.
"__label__Other In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated."
"__label__Other She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait."
"__label__Other She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect."
__label__Other She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.
"__label__Other The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up."
"__label__Other She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep."
"__label__diabetes.a1c.during_dct Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter."
__label__Other CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.
"__label__medication.aspirin..after_dct She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine."
"__label__Other Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital."
"__label__Other She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results."
__label__Other ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.
__label__Other Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).
__label__Other She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.
"__label__Other Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits."
"__label__Other In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait."

__label__Other We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.

__label__Other 1.
"__label__Other Annual physical, preventative maintenance."
__label__Other The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.
__label__Other I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.
__label__Other Immunizations are up-to-date.
__label__Other He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.
__label__Other His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.

"__label__Other Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile."
__label__Other The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.
__label__Other We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.
__label__Other 2.
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
"__label__Other The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar."
"__label__Other Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR."
"__label__medication.insulin..before_dct I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement."
__label__Other We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.
__label__Other I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.
__label__Other 3.
__label__obese.mention.before_dct Obesity.
"__label__Other We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance."
__label__diabetes.mention.during_dct I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.
__label__Other 4.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct CAD with history of DVT.
__label__Other He has had an ICD interrogated recently.
__label__Other We will check a lipid panel today.
"__label__Other We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point."

__label__Other Name:  Xochilt Vuong
__label__Other MRN:  6398353
"__label__Other REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine."
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 
__label__Other going back more than 10 years.
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 
__label__Other over approximately the same period of time.
__label__Other She has a complicated history 
"__label__Other including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission."
__label__Other Her 
"__label__Other creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, "
"__label__Other 1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 "
"__label__Other obtained on July 06, 2064."
__label__Other She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.
"__label__Other Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal "
__label__Other at 81.
__label__Other Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 
__label__Other proteinuria since that time.
__label__Other Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 
"__label__Other March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of "
"__label__Other obstruction, stones, or masses."
__label__Other She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.
__label__Other She does 
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment "
__label__Other for any proliferative retinopathy.
"__label__Other Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and "

__label__Other She vomits rarely.
__label__Other Her weight has fallen by about 20 
__label__Other pounds.
__label__Other She is slightly constipated.

"__label__Other PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but "
__label__Other reasonably comfortable.
"__label__Other She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, "
__label__Other which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.
__label__Other Her blood pressure in 
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72."
__label__Other Her chest has a few basal 
__label__Other crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.
__label__Other JVP fills below the 
"__label__Other sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left "
__label__Other sternal border.
__label__Other Abdomen is soft and nontender.
__label__Other There is no renal tenderness.
__label__Other Extremities have no edema.
__label__Other IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 
__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct 10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
__label__Other The 
"__label__Other proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but "
__label__Other this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.
__label__Other It would be useful to know 
__label__Other from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.
"__label__Other It is, of course, also "
__label__Other possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.
__label__Other Their symmetry and 
__label__Other the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.
__label__Other The ACE 
__label__Other inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 
__label__Other creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.
__label__Other Her loss of appetite and 
__label__Other nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.
"__label__Other RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal "
"__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and "
__label__Other hyperlipidemia.
__label__Other This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.
__label__Other It think it 
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 
__label__Other perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 
__label__Other less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.
"__label__Other If, of course, shortness of "
"__label__Other breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be "
__label__Other reasonable.
"__label__Other It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of "
__label__Other metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 
__label__Other requirement for Lasix.
__label__Other If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 
"__label__Other diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might "
__label__Other be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.
__label__Other Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 
__label__Other from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 
__label__Other Aranesp).
"__label__Other PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may "
__label__Other help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.
"__label__Other If so, the "
__label__Other measures proposed would be appropriate.
__label__Other We discussed the eventual probable 
__label__Other need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).
__label__Other It would 
__label__Other be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 
"__label__Other floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis."
"__label__Other We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before "
__label__Other a need for it arises.
"__label__Other I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this "
__label__Other done in the next few months.
__label__Other This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 
__label__Other or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.
"__label__Other I will, of course, help with any of "
__label__Other these measures as necessary.
"__label__Other Xander Xie, M.D."
__label__Other Wanda
__label__Other Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).
"__label__Other This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease."
__label__Other I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.
__label__Other If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

"__label__smoker.unknown Dear Nurse Rivas, "
__label__Other We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.
__label__Other The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures."
"__label__Other She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food."
"__label__Other This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet."
__label__medication.diuretic..before_dct Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.
"__label__Other Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures."
__label__Other Mrs. Doss continues to do well.
"__label__medication.diuretic..before_dct She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste."
"__label__Other She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization."
"__label__Other She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results."
"__label__Other Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm."
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).
__label__Other Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.
"__label__Other However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke."
"__label__Other She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6."
"__label__Other She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting."
"__label__Other She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving."
"__label__Other She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production."
__label__Other She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.
"__label__Other She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure."

__label__Other Assessment and Recommendations:
"__label__hyperlipidemia.mention.during_dct 58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures."
"__label__Other She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December."
__label__medication.thienopyridine..during_dct We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.
"__label__Other The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel."
"__label__Other If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge."
"__label__hypertension.mention.during_dct However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control."
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action."
__label__medication.statin..before_dct Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.
"__label__Other Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated."
"__label__Other I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin."
__label__Other She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.
"__label__Other If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication."
"__label__Other Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer."
"__label__Other Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed."
"__label__Other Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam."
"__label__Other Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan."
__label__Other Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.
__label__Other I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.

__label__Other 	due PACS technical difficulties.
__label__Other Comparison is made with the
__label__Other 	report of prior C-spine CT from January 2095.
__label__Other History:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic
__label__Other 	injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8.
"__label__Other Technique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical,"
"__label__Other 	thoracic, lumbar spine."
__label__Other The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10
__label__Other 	through L1.
__label__Other The images are moderately motion degraded in the
__label__Other 	thoracic and lumbar spine.
__label__Other The cervical spine MRI was repeated
__label__Other 	three times due to motion.
__label__Other No contrast was used.
__label__Other Findings:
__label__Other 	CERVICAL SPINE:
__label__Other 	Straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through
__label__Other 	C6.
__label__Other Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal
__label__Other 	within the C4 and C5 vertebral body.
__label__Other Posterior disc osteophyte
"__label__Other 	complexes are present at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6, C6/C7."
__label__Other The patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which
__label__Other 	causes susceptibility artifact.
__label__Other The laminectomy from C3 through
"__label__Other 	C7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion"
__label__Other 	artifact and susceptibility.
__label__Other THORACIC SPINE:
__label__Other 	There is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and
__label__Other 	focal kyphosis at this area.
__label__Other Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through
__label__Other 	T5.
__label__Other There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the
__label__Other 	T4 level.
__label__Other T2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6
__label__Other 	through T12.
__label__Other A high signal septation is present through this
__label__Other 	collection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1.
__label__Other This low T2
__label__Other 	signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through
__label__Other 	T10.
__label__Other The cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia
__label__Other 	and high T2 signal.
__label__Other High signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal
__label__Other 	thoracic cord and at the conus.
__label__Other Small amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal
__label__Other 	thoracic cord and the spinal roots.
__label__Other LUMBAR SPINE:
__label__Other 	Straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1
__label__Other 	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5.
__label__Other There is a levoscoliosis with apex at
__label__Other 	L4/L5.
__label__Other Disc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and
"__label__Other 	disc height loss at L4/L5, L5/S1."
__label__Other T2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4/L5 and
__label__Other 	L5/S1 disc levels.
__label__Other Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral
__label__Other 	neural foramen at L5/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss
__label__Other 	of L5/S1 is noted.
__label__Other The patient has had prior surgery of the
__label__Other 	spinous processes of L4 and L5.
__label__Other The conus terminates at L1/L2.
__label__Other The spinal roots appear clumped
__label__Other 	centrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal
__label__Other 	roots.
__label__Other T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal
__label__Other 	sac.
__label__Other IMPRESSION:
__label__Other 	 1.
__label__Other Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with
__label__Other 	displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10.
__label__Other The differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual
__label__Other 	flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural
__label__Other 	collections.
__label__Other Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI
__label__Other 	with contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine.
__label__Other If
"__label__Other 	clinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast."
__label__Other Dr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12/12/95.
__label__Other 2.
__label__Other Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at
__label__Other 	T7-10.
__label__Other The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in
__label__Other 	appearance suggesting arachnoiditis.
__label__Other Repeat axial images through
__label__Other 	the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.
__label__Other Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4/L5 and
__label__Other 	L5/S1.
__label__Other degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3/C4
__label__Other 	C4/C5 C5/C6.
__label__Other Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies
__label__Other 	are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.
__label__Other Please see
__label__Other 	prior CT report for the details.
__label__Other Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute
__label__Other 	and may be from prior trauma.

__label__Other Status post recent
__label__Other 	aorto-bifemoral bypass.
__label__Other Now with sudden onset of loss of lower
__label__Other 	extremity motor function and sensation.
__label__Other Comparison: MRI spine dated 12/12/95.
__label__Other Procedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was
__label__Other 	performed without and with Gadolinium.
__label__Other 	There is an old compression fracture at T5.
__label__Other There is exaggeration
__label__Other 	of the normal kyphosis at this level.
__label__Other There is no evidence of
__label__Other 	marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.
__label__Other There is
__label__Other 	straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.
__label__Other There is grade 1
__label__Other There is degenerative change in the
__label__Other 	L4-5 and L5-S1 end plates.
__label__Other There is increased T2 signal in the
__label__Other 	L4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well
"__label__Other 	preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,"
__label__Other 	it is considered very unlikely.
__label__Other There is a small central disc
__label__Other 	protrusion at T8-9.
__label__Other There is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic
__label__Other 	or lumbar spine.
__label__Other Examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from
__label__Other 	the T5 level inferiorly.
__label__Other There is prominent flow artifact in the
__label__Other 	CSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord.
__label__Other The conus is expanded and
__label__Other 	demonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences.
__label__Other There is no
__label__Other 	associated enhancement.
__label__Other No vascular flow voids are identified.
__label__Other There is a small right pleural effusion.
__label__Other There is consolidation
__label__Other 	at the right lung base.
__label__Other This may represent atelectasis or
__label__Other 	infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.
__label__Other 	Expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on
__label__Other 	chronic myelomalacia.
__label__Other The differential diagnosis includes cord
"__label__Other 	infarction, and demyelinating disease."
__label__Other Vascular malformation and
__label__Other 	neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular
__label__Other 	flow voids and abnormal enhancement.
__label__Other MRA:  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental
__label__Other 	protocol.
__label__Other FINDINGS:
"__label__Other 	Due to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were"
__label__Other 	performed to evaluate the vasculature.
__label__Other The remainder of the
__label__Other 	abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically
"__label__Other 	indicated, directed sequences could be performed."
__label__Other This was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast
__label__Other 	bolus and movement.
__label__Other The patient was agitated and unable to
__label__Other 	cooperate .
__label__Other No evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.
__label__Other There is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just
__label__Other 	beyond its origin.
__label__Other The celiac trunk is patent.
__label__Other There is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the
__label__Other 	superior mesenteric artery.
__label__Other The renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.
__label__Other 	1.
__label__Other Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement
__label__Other 	however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.
__label__Other A
__label__Other 	repeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained
__label__Other 	if clinically indicated.
__label__Other Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the
__label__Other 	left subclavian artery.
__label__Other Mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.

"__label__Other RE: LINDSAY, Anastasha "
__label__Other SDP#: 5563788 
__label__Other Dear Dr. Ho:  
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lindsay today in follow up at the Saint Davids Pavilion Neurology.
__label__Other I last saw her on 07/27/2112.
__label__Other She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness.
__label__Other Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well.
__label__Other She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady.
__label__Other She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness.
__label__Other She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls.
__label__Other Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
__label__Other instead of 25 mg p.o.
__label__Other q.d.
__label__Other She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes.
"__label__Other She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia."
__label__Other She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.
"__label__Other She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that ""her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane""."
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o.
__label__Other from aspirin.
__label__Other This was done without my knowledge as well.
"__label__Other She continues to have difficulty ""feeling my feet"" and this has been a chronic problem for her as well."
__label__Other On examination she is alert.
__label__Other She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed.
__label__Other Her speech is fluent in English.
__label__Other English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language.
__label__Other Her visual fields are full to confrontation.
__label__Other Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus.
__label__Other Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening.
__label__Other She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side.
__label__Other She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing.
__label__Other Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady.
__label__Other She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.
"__label__Other IMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion."
__label__Other This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time.
__label__Other In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor.
__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether.
__label__Other Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.
__label__Other I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.
"__label__Other Sincerely, "

__label__Other CC:  L leg/foot pain
"__label__Other History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year."
__label__Other He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.
"__label__Other However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side."
__label__Other This lasted for ~24 hours.
"__label__Other He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis."
"__label__Other He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx."
"__label__Other He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM."
__label__Other On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

__label__Other Ludlow Medical Center

"__label__Other Post, IN  86454"
__label__Other Dear Dr. Nall:
__label__Other It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.
"__label__cad.event.before_dct As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090."
"__label__cad.event.before_dct He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest."
"__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin."
"__label__Other Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event."
__label__cad.event.before_dct He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.
__label__cad.event.before_dct He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.
"__label__Other He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function."
__label__Other Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.
"__label__Other As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level."
__label__Other He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.
__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.
__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).
"__label__Other Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition."
__label__Other He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.
__label__medication.aspirin..before_dct His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o.
"__label__medication.thienopyridine..after_dct daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.statin..before_dct daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o."
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o."
"__label__Other daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o."
"__label__Other daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily."
__label__Other He has no known drug allergies.
__label__Other Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.
__label__Other He is in no distress.
__label__Other Weight is 221 lbs.
__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.
"__label__Other His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits."
__label__Other His chest is clear to auscultation.
"__label__Other His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs."
__label__Other He had no peripheral edema.
__label__Other His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.
__label__Other He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.
"__label__Other EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves."
__label__Other We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
__label__medication.niacin..before_dct He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.
__label__Other His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL.
"__label__Other His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL."
__label__diabetes.a1c.during_dct HbA1c is 7.2%.
__label__Other The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.
__label__Other Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.
"__label__Other To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:"
__label__Other 1.

__label__Other RE:  Kenneth Umstead
__label__Other      MR #401-10-87-8
__label__Other Dear Jac:
"__label__Other I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today"
__label__Other and he seems like he is improved.
__label__Other He feels his legs are better and
__label__Other that he can walk greater distances.
__label__Other He feels very comfortable.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,"
"__label__medication.calcium_channel_blocker..before_dct Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day."
"__label__hypertension.high_bp.during_dct On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of"
__label__Other 65 and regular.
__label__Other Weight 210 pounds.
__label__Other Head and neck unremarkable.
__label__Other Chest is clear.
__label__Other Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
__label__Other systolic ejection murmur.
__label__Other The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
__label__Other Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
__label__Other sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation.
__label__Other There is a nonspecific
__label__Other intraventricular conduction delay.
__label__Other I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well.
__label__Other He would like to have his
__label__Other arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
__label__Other schedule.
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..after_dct In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and"
__label__Other if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
__label__Other more prolonged risk prevention.
__label__Other I suggest that we increase it to 50
__label__Other mg bid.
__label__Other I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
__label__Other eye on it.
__label__Other If it drops too low we can reduce the dose.
__label__Other He asked
__label__Other that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
__label__Other and I will be happy to do so.
__label__Other If any problems develop in the
__label__Other interim please do not hesitate to contact me.
__label__Other Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.
__label__Other Kindest regards.

__label__Other New Patient Visit
__label__Other Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion
__label__Other History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden.
__label__Other He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH.
__label__Other Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT.
"__label__Other Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53."
"__label__Other He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments."
"__label__Other The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative."
__label__Other He has the reports here with him.
"__label__Other The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion."
__label__Other He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis.
__label__Other This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him.
"__label__Other He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done."
"__label__Other Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH."
"__label__Other I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future."
__label__Other I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA.
__label__Other He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

__label__Other RE: Otis Narvaez
__label__Other         MR   #04561326
__label__Other Dear Dr. Huynh:
__label__Other I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 
__label__Other consultation.
__label__Other As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 
"__label__hypertension.mention.before_dct of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity."
"__label__Other Recently, he underwent "
__label__Other evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 
__label__Other dobutamine stress echocardiography.
__label__Other The echocardiogram revealed reduced 
__label__Other left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.
__label__Other There was no evidence of ischemia.
__label__Other He subsequently underwent coronary 
__label__Other catheterization.
"__label__Other I do not have those results, but he claims that he was "
__label__Other told that he had no arterial blockages.
"__label__Other Symptomatically, he is "
__label__Other significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.
__label__Other He has attributed 
__label__Other this to his weight.
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..during_dct He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, "
__label__Other although he has not been taking either of these medications.
__label__Other Prior to 
__label__Other his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 
__label__Other upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.
__label__Other This was confirmed 
"__label__Other subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary "
__label__Other lung malignancy.
__label__Other He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 
__label__Other you.
"__label__hypertension.mention.after_dct His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low "
"__label__obese.mention.before_dct back pain, and obesity."
"__label__medication.metformin..before_dct Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po "
"__label__Other q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin."
__label__Other No drug allergies
__label__Other Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.
__label__Other Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.
__label__Other He smoked for 
__label__smoker.past 40 years but quit approximately three years ago.
"__label__Other He drinks rarely, "
__label__Other although drank heavily in the past.
__label__Other        MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 
"__label__Other December 30,  2072                                         "
__label__Other Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.
__label__Other He denies 
__label__Other gastrointestinal complaints.
__label__obese.mention.during_dct On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 
__label__Other 140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.
"__label__Other HEENT is unremarkable, neck "
"__label__Other supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full "
"__label__Other without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: "
"__label__Other regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no "
__label__Other murmurs or rubs.
__label__Other Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 
__label__Other CVA tenderness.
__label__Other No clubbing cyanosis or edema.
__label__Other Pulses full.
__label__Other Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 
__label__Other function by echocardiogram.
__label__Other By report he has no evidence of coronary 
"__label__Other artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself."
__label__Other If indeed 
"__label__Other it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that "
__label__Other this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 
__label__diabetes.mention.after_dct his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.
"__label__Other In any case, this "
"__label__Other puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so "
__label__Other than if he had significant coronary disease.
__label__Other I see no reason why you 
__label__Other should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.
__label__Other Prior

__label__Other Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
__label__Other A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as:

__label__Other 4).
__label__Other Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.
"__label__Other Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order."
__label__Other This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
"__label__Other If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it."
__label__Other He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable.
__label__Other There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

"__label__Other X. R. Xi, MD, PhD"
"__label__Other Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811"
"__label__Other Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098"
__label__Other ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
__label__Other Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery
__label__Other History of Present Illness:
__label__Other 	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery.
"__label__Other Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards."
"__label__Other If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution."
__label__Other He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).
"__label__Other Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis."
"__label__medication.ace_inhibitor..before_dct His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement."
"__label__Other A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday."
"__label__Other There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr."
"__label__Other The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent)."
__label__Other An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
__label__Other He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.
"__label__Other He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea."
"__label__Other He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema."
__label__Other He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.
"__label__Other He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting."
__label__Other His lasix dose has not changed.
__label__cad.mention.before_dct He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.
__label__Other He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.

__label__Other Impression and Plan:
__label__Other This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.
__label__Other The issues include:
__label__Other Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.
__label__Other I would consider:
__label__Other increasing his diuretic (eg.
__label__Other Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.
"__label__Other Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation."
"__label__Other He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed"
__label__Other consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
__label__Other consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
__label__cad.event.before_dct Prevention of periperative MI
"__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively"
"__label__cad.mention.before_dct No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)"
"__label__Other Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)"
__label__Other Prevention of perioperative AF
__label__medication.beta_blocker..during_dct Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
__label__Other Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
__label__Other Endocarditis prophylaxis
__label__Other He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve
__label__Other We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.
